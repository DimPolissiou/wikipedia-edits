{"title_page": "Error (baseball)", "text_new": "[[File:Billbuckner.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|[[Boston Red Sox]]'s [[infielder]] [[Bill Buckner]] makes a error at first base.]]\nIn [[baseball]] [[baseball statistics|statistics]], an '''error''' is an act, in the judgment of the [[official scorer]], of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] or [[baserunner]] to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. The term  ''error'' can also refer to the [[List of baseball jargon (P)#play (noun)|play]] during which an error was committed.\n\n==Relationship to other statistical categories==\nAn error does not count as a [[hit (baseball statistics)|hit]] but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless, in the scorer's judgment, the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base(s) reached was the result of the fielder's mistake. In that case, the play will be scored both as a hit (for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to) ''and'' an error. However, if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder's mistake, it is scored as a \"hit on error,\" and treated the same as if the batter had been put out, hence lowering his batting average.\n\nSimilarly, a batter does not receive credit for a [[run batted in]] (RBI) when runs score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake. For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a [[sacrifice fly]] and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in.\n\nIf a play should have resulted in a [[fielder's choice]] with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely but the runner is safe due to an error, the play will be scored as a fielder's choice, with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder.\n\n[[Passed ball]]s and [[wild pitch]]es are separate statistical categories and are not scored as errors.\n\nIf a batted ball were hit on the fly into foul territory, with the batting team having no runner(s) on base, and a fielder misplayed such ball for an error, it is possible for a team on the winning side of a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] to commit at least one error, yet still qualify as a perfect game.\n\nThere is a curious loophole in the rules on errors for catchers. If a catcher makes a \"wild throw\" in an attempt to prevent a stolen base and the runner is safe, the catcher is not charged with an error even if it could be argued that the runner would have been put out with \"ordinary effort.\"  There is therefore a \"no fault\" condition for the catcher attempting to prevent a steal. However, when considering that the majority of stolen base attempts are successful (around 2 successes per failure), this \"no fault rule\" is understandable due to the difficulty of throwing out runners. If the runner takes an additional base due to the wild throw, an error '''is''' charged for that advance. However, if the catcher's glove is hit by the bat, it is counted as a catcher's interference and the catcher is given an error unless the batter gets a hit off the play.\n\nIf a run scores by the end of the inning that would not have scored in the absence of the error, the run is categorized as [[unearned run|unearned]], meaning that it is not treated in the statistics as having been the responsibility of the [[pitcher (baseball)|pitcher]].\n\n==Statistical significance==\nTraditionally, the number of errors was a statistic used to quantify the skill of a fielder. Research has shown that the error rate is higher when the quality of fielding is suspect, e.g., the performance of an expansion team in its first year, or the fielding done by replacement players during World War II, and is lower when playing conditions are better, e.g. on artificial turf and during night games.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kalist |first1=David E. |last2=Spurr |first2=Stephen J. |title=Baseball Errors |journal=Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports |date=2006 |volume=2 |issue=4 |doi=10.2202/1559-0410.1043}}</ref>\n\nHowever, fans and analysts have questioned the usefulness and significance of errors as a metric for fielding skill. Notably, mental misjudgments, such as failure to cover a base or attempting a [[force play|force out]] when such a play is not available, are not considered errors.\n\nA more subtle, though more significant objection to the error, as [[sabermetrics|sabermetricians]] have noted, is more conceptual. In order for a fielder to be charged with an error, he must have done something right by being in the correct place to be able to attempt the play. A poor fielder may \"avoid\" many errors simply by being unable to reach batted or thrown balls that a better fielder could successfully reach. Thus, it is possible that a poor fielder will have fewer errors than any fielder with higher expectancies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/04/16/sabermetrics-fielding-percentage-and-error-dont-tell-whole-story/|title=Sabermetrics: Fielding percentage and errors don\u2019t tell whole story|work=[[The Brown Daily Herald]]|first=Lewis|last=Pollis|date=April 16, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn recent times, official scorers have made some attempt to take a fielder's supposed \"extraordinary\" effort or positioning into account when judging whether the play should have been successful given ordinary effort. However, this still leaves statistics, such as [[fielding percentage]], that are based on errors as a way to compare the defensive abilities of players.\n\nErrors also hold significance in calculating the [[earned run average]] (ERA) of a pitcher.

Although a local academy was created, the first officers were sent to France for their training as well. One of them, [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Manuel \u00c1valos Prado, took command over the Chilean military aviation school, which was officially established in February 1913, and remained in command until 1915. The Escuela de Aviaci\u00f3n Militar (Military Aviation School) was named in honor of him in 1944, and still carries that name today.\n\nIn those early years many aviation milestones were achieved; conquering the height of the [[Andes]] was one of the main targets as well as long distance flights. Typical aircraft of that era were [[Avro 504]], [[Bleriot XI]], [[Bristol M.1|Bristol M.1C]], [[De Havilland DH.9|DH.9]], and [[SE5a]]. In the following decade, the (Airmail Line of Chile) L\u00ednea Aeropostal de Chile was created on 5 March 1929 as a branch of the military aviation. This postal airline later developed into the airline [[Lan (airline)|L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Nacional]] (National Airline) that is still the leading airline in Chile today. Shortly afterwards, on 21 March 1930, the existing aviation elements of the army and navy were amalgamated into a dedicated department: the Subsecretaria de Aviaci\u00f3n (Department of the Air Force) effectively creating the current independent Air Force. It was initially named Fuerza A\u00e9rea Nacional (National Air Force). The international airport of Chile carries the name of Lan's founding father and first commander of the air force, Air Commodore Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez. Its baptism of fire was in the 1931 sailors' rebellion in Coquimbo, where Air Force attack aircraft and bombers and 2 transport planes converted into bombers contributed to its failure.\n\nThe first outlines of the organization of the current air force were visible in 1945 with the inception of Grupo de Transporte No.1 (First Transport Group), later renumbered Grupo 10, with two [[Beechcraft Model 18|C-45]]s and a single [[T-6 Texan]] at Los Cerrillos. Two years later the first Fuerza A\u00e9rea flight to [[Antarctica]] was performed. The fifties meant entry into the [[Jet aircraft|jet]] age for the FACh, and Grupo 7 was the first unit to receive them in 1954. Chile got its aircraft from both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. The American supply consisted of [[P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed F-80]], [[T-33 Shooting Star|Lockheed T-33]], Beech [[T-34 Mentor]], [[Cessna T-37]], [[Cessna A-37 Dragonfly]] and [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E/F]] for example, whereas the British supplied [[Hawker Hunter]]s and the French delivered various helicopters and Dassault [[Mirage 50]] aircraft.\n\nDuring the [[Chilean coup of 1973|military coup d'\u00e9tat]] on September 11, 1973, the Chilean Air Force bombarded the palace at the request of the [[Chilean Army]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12301319 Inquiry into 1973 death of Chile's Salvador Allende] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225092401/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12301319 |date=2018-12-25 }} BBC 2011</ref>\n\nThe Chilean air force hosted the joint exercise [[South America air forces maneuvers|Salitre]] with other friendly nations in 2014.<ref>[https://dialogo-americas.com/en/articles/salitre-2014-exercise-chile-promotes-cooperation-among-five-air-forces Salitre 2014 Exercise in Chile promotes cooperation among five air forces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306055020/https://dialogo-americas.com/en/articles/salitre-2014-exercise-chile-promotes-cooperation-among-five-air-forces |date=2019-03-06 }} Dialogo Americas 2014</ref> It also participated in several United Nations peacekeeping missions overseas in 5 occasions.\n\n===Commanders-in-chief===\n{{main article|List of commanders-in-chief of the Chilean Air Force}}\n\n==Order of battle==\nPersonnel = 10,600 (including 700 [[conscripts]])\n\n===Office of the Commander in Chief===\n{{Empty section|date=July 2013 }}\n\n===Combat Command of the Air Force===\n[[File:Ciudad Parque Bicentenario - 13.jpg|thumb|The Delphos building, designed by the Division of Infrastructure of the Logistics Command]]\n'''First Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Los C\u00f3ndores Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Los C\u00f3ndores) in [[Iquique]]\n* 1st Aviation Squadron\n* 2nd Aviation Squadron\n* 3rd Aviation Squadron\n* 24th Air Defense Squadron\n* 34th Telecommunications Squadron\n* 44th Aviation Infantry Squadron\n'''Second Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Pudahuel Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Pudahuel) in [[Santiago]]\n* 9th Aviation Squadron\n* 10th Aviation Squadron\n* [[Air Defence and Special Forces Regiment]] (Regimiento de Artiller\u00eda Antia\u00e9rea y FF.EE)\n* 32nd Telecommunications Squadron\n'''Third Air Brigade''' with headquarters in El Tepual Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea El Tepual) in [[Puerto Montt]]\n* 5th Aviation Squadron\n* 25th Air Defense Squadron\n* 35th Telecommunications Squadron\n'''Fourth Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Chabunco Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Chabunco) in [[Punta Arenas]]\n* 6th Aviation Squadron\n[[File:Chilean F-16 Fidae 2006.JPG|thumb|[[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16D Block 50M]] of Chilean Air Force]]\n* 12th Aviation Squadron\n* 23rd Air Defense Squadron\n* 33rd Telecommunications Squadron\n* 19th Antarctic Exploration Squadron\n'''Fifth Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Cerro Moreno Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Cerro Moreno) in [[Antofagasta]]\n* 7th Aviation Squadron\n* 8th Aviation Squadron\n* 21st Air Defense Squadron\n* 31st Telecommunications Squadron\n* 41st Aviation Infantry Squadron\n\n===Personnel Command===\n'''Education Division'''\n* Aviation School \"Captain Manuel \u00c1valos Prado\"\n* Air Specialties School \"Flight Sergeant Adolfo Menadier Rojas\"\n* NCO Perfectioning School\n* Air War Academy\n* Aeronautical Polytechnical Academy\n* Air Photographic Surveying Service\n'''Health Division'''<br />\n'''General Hospital of the Air Force'''<br />\n'''Air Force High Command Prefecture'''\n\n===Logistics Command===\n'''Maintenance Division'''<br />\n'''Administration Division'''<br />\n'''Infrastructure Division'''\n\n==Aircraft==\n=== Current inventory ===\n[[File:Chile Air Force Northrop F-5E Tigre III Lofting-2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|A Chilean Air Force F-5E in flight]]\n[[File:EB-707 Condor, Chilean Air Force (FACh) v2.jpg|thumb|right|The EB-707 Condor surveillance aircraft]]\n[[File:Bell 412 Chilean Air Force (FACh).JPG|thumb|right|A Bell 412 on lift off]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Furthermore, the assembly of the [[CASA C-101|A-36/T-36 Halc\u00f3n (CASA C-101)]] was achieved as well.  Performing maintenance on most types in the current inventory, such as minor modifications on F-5E aircraft for example, the industry is of significant importance to the air force. ENAER is reported to be in talks with Embraer of Brazil to codesign the first indigenous South American military transport plane. Also, under the Pacer Amstel programme, with initial Dutch support, and later locally ENAER upgraded an F-16 combat jet, which for the Chilean Air Force is an advance for their maintenance of the F-16 fleet (becoming the 5th country to modify their jets under authorization).\n\n==Ranks==\n{{Main|Air Force ranks and insignia of Chile}}\n;Officers\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa;

Although a local academy was created, the first officers were sent to France for their training as well. One of them, [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Manuel \u00c1valos Prado, took command over the Chilean military aviation school, which was officially established in February 1913, and remained in command until 1915. The Escuela de Aviaci\u00f3n Militar (Military Aviation School) was named in honor of him in 1944, and still carries that name today.\n\nIn those early years many aviation milestones were achieved; conquering the height of the [[Andes]] was one of the main targets as well as long distance flights. Typical aircraft of that era were [[Avro 504]], [[Bleriot XI]], [[Bristol M.1|Bristol M.1C]], [[De Havilland DH.9|DH.9]], and [[SE5a]]. In the following decade, the (Airmail Line of Chile) L\u00ednea Aeropostal de Chile was created on 5 March 1929 as a branch of the military aviation. This postal airline later developed into the airline [[Lan (airline)|L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Nacional]] (National Airline) that is still the leading airline in Chile today. Shortly afterwards, on 21 March 1930, the existing aviation elements of the army and navy were amalgamated into a dedicated department: the Subsecretaria de Aviaci\u00f3n (Department of the Air Force) effectively creating the current independent Air Force. It was initially named Fuerza A\u00e9rea Nacional (National Air Force). The international airport of Chile carries the name of Lan's founding father and first commander of the air force, Air Commodore Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez. Its baptism of fire was in the 1931 sailors' rebellion in Coquimbo, where Air Force attack aircraft and bombers and 2 transport planes converted into bombers contributed to its failure.\n\nThe first outlines of the organization of the current air force were visible in 1945 with the inception of Grupo de Transporte No.1 (First Transport Group), later renumbered Grupo 10, with two [[Beechcraft Model 18|C-45]]s and a single [[T-6 Texan]] at Los Cerrillos. Two years later the first Fuerza A\u00e9rea flight to [[Antarctica]] was performed. The fifties meant entry into the [[Jet aircraft|jet]] age for the FACh, and Grupo 7 was the first unit to receive them in 1954. Chile got its aircraft from both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. The American supply consisted of [[P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed F-80]], [[T-33 Shooting Star|Lockheed T-33]], Beech [[T-34 Mentor]], [[Cessna T-37]], [[Cessna A-37 Dragonfly]] and [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E/F]] for example, whereas the British supplied [[Hawker Hunter]]s and the French delivered various helicopters and Dassault [[Mirage 50]] aircraft.\n\nDuring the [[Chilean coup of 1973|military coup d'\u00e9tat]] on September 11, 1973, the Chilean Air Force bombarded the palace at the request of the [[Chilean Army]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12301319 Inquiry into 1973 death of Chile's Salvador Allende] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225092401/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12301319 |date=2018-12-25 }} BBC 2011</ref>\n\nThe Chilean air force hosted the joint exercise [[South America air forces maneuvers|Salitre]] with other friendly nations in 2014.<ref>[https://dialogo-americas.com/en/articles/salitre-2014-exercise-chile-promotes-cooperation-among-five-air-forces Salitre 2014 Exercise in Chile promotes cooperation among five air forces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306055020/https://dialogo-americas.com/en/articles/salitre-2014-exercise-chile-promotes-cooperation-among-five-air-forces |date=2019-03-06 }} Dialogo Americas 2014</ref> It also participated in several United Nations peacekeeping missions overseas in 5 occasions.\n\n===Commanders-in-chief===\n{{main article|List of commanders-in-chief of the Chilean Air Force}}\n\n==Order of battle==\nPersonnel = 10,600 (including 700 [[conscripts]])\n\n===Office of the Commander in Chief===\n{{Empty section|date=July 2013 }}\n\n===Combat Command of the Air Force===\n[[File:Ciudad Parque Bicentenario - 13.jpg|thumb|The Delphos building, designed by the Division of Infrastructure of the Logistics Command]]\n'''First Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Los C\u00f3ndores Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Los C\u00f3ndores) in [[Iquique]]\n* 1st Aviation Squadron\n* 2nd Aviation Squadron\n* 3rd Aviation Squadron\n* 24th Air Defense Squadron\n* 34th Telecommunications Squadron\n* 44th Aviation Infantry Squadron\n'''Second Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Pudahuel Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Pudahuel) in [[Santiago]]\n* 9th Aviation Squadron\n* 10th Aviation Squadron\n* [[Air Defence and Special Forces Regiment]] (Regimiento de Artiller\u00eda Antia\u00e9rea y FF.EE)\n* 32nd Telecommunications Squadron\n'''Third Air Brigade''' with headquarters in El Tepual Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea El Tepual) in [[Puerto Montt]]\n* 5th Aviation Squadron\n* 25th Air Defense Squadron\n* 35th Telecommunications Squadron\n'''Fourth Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Chabunco Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Chabunco) in [[Punta Arenas]]\n* 6th Aviation Squadron\n[[File:Chilean F-16 Fidae 2006.JPG|thumb|[[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16D Block 50M]] of Chilean Air Force]]\n* 12th Aviation Squadron\n* 23rd Air Defense Squadron\n* 33rd Telecommunications Squadron\n* 19th Antarctic Exploration Squadron\n'''Fifth Air Brigade''' with headquarters in Cerro Moreno Air Base (Base A\u00e9rea Cerro Moreno) in [[Antofagasta]]\n* 7th Aviation Squadron\n* 8th Aviation Squadron\n* 21st Air Defense Squadron\n* 31st Telecommunications Squadron\n* 41st Aviation Infantry Squadron\n\n===Personnel Command===\n'''Education Division'''\n* Aviation School \"Captain Manuel \u00c1valos Prado\"\n* Air Specialties School \"Flight Sergeant Adolfo Menadier Rojas\"\n* NCO Perfectioning School\n* Air War Academy\n* Aeronautical Polytechnical Academy\n* Air Photographic Surveying Service\n'''Health Division'''<br />\n'''General Hospital of the Air Force'''<br />\n'''Air Force High Command Prefecture'''\n\n===Logistics Command===\n'''Maintenance Division'''<br />\n'''Administration Division'''<br />\n'''Infrastructure Division'''\n\n==Aircraft==\n=== Current inventory ===\n[[File:Chile Air Force Northrop F-5E Tigre III Lofting-2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|A Chilean Air Force F-5E in flight]]\n[[File:EB-707 Condor, Chilean Air Force (FACh) v2.jpg|thumb|right|The EB-707 Condor surveillance aircraft]]\n[[File:Bell 412 Chilean Air Force (FACh).JPG|thumb|right|A Bell 412 on lift off]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The design of the [[T-35 Pill\u00e1n]] trainer, based on the Piper PA-28 Dakota, is the best known example, seeing some export success as well. Furthermore, the assembly of the [[CASA C-101|A-36/T-36 Halc\u00f3n (CASA C-101)]] was achieved as well.  Performing maintenance on most types in the current inventory, such as minor modifications on F-5E aircraft for example, the industry is of significant importance to the air force. ENAER is reported to be in talks with Embraer of Brazil to codesign the first indigenous South American military transport plane. Also, under the Pacer Amstel programme, with initial Dutch support, and later locally ENAER upgraded an F-16 combat jet, which for the Chilean Air Force is an advance for their maintenance of the F-16 fleet (becoming the 5th country to modify their jets under authorization).\n\n==Ranks==\n{{Main|Air Force ranks and insignia of Chile}}\n;Officers\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa;

These events, lead by the King and his predecessors before him, are put in place to assist and help ease the burdens and challenges faced by people.\n\nPoukai are also occasions of great celebration where entire iwi (tribes) and hap\u016b (sub-tribe) come together to prepare a great h\u0101kari (feast) in honour of the King and the Royal family. \nThe Poukai Marae are:\n\nHorahora | Kokohinau | Taniwha | Hukanui | Maurea | Poutu | Parawera | Aotearoa / Rawhitiroa | Rakaunui | Waipapa | Maketu | Okapu | Turangawaewae | Mirumiru | Te Kuiti Pa | Huria | Te Papaorotu | Nga Taierua | Tainui-a-whiro | Ngati Pikiao | Pohara | Whatapaka | Tauranganui | Wahi Pa | Mangatangi | Ngatira / Pikitu | Te Awamarahi | Waikare | Reretewhioi\n\n==Political advancements==\n\nKing Tuheitia has been at the forefront of many political issues, particularly pertaining to M\u0101ori.

Each successive Monarch has had a Tekau-m\u0101-Rua to offer advice and act as a senior council within the Kiingitanga.\n\nIn 2012 King Tuheitia formally established his Tekau-m\u0101-Rua<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maoritelevision.com/news/latest-news/tekau-ma-rua-waiting-be-finalised|title=Tekau-m\u0101-rua waiting to be finalised|website=M\u0101ori Television|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> and he also added a spiritual council, called Te K\u0101hui Wairua. These two councils work together in providing advice, guidance and a strategic platform for the King and the Kiingitanga. A unique aspect of King Tuheitia's Tekau-m\u0101-Rua, and a first for the Kiingitanga, is a council made up of members from outside of the Waikato tribal region (the direct tribe of the King).\n\n=== Tekau-m\u0101-Rua ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|''<u>'''Member'''</u>''\n|''<u>'''Karangatanga (representative area)'''</u>''\n|-\n|Rikirangi Gage (Chairperson)\n|Te Wh\u0101nau-\u0101-Apanui\n|-\n|Kihi Ngatai\n|Tauranga Moana\n|-\n|Prof. Pou Temara\n|Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe\n|-\n|Te Kahautu Maxwell\n|Te Whakatohea\n|-\n|Sir Toby Curtis\n|Te Arawa\n|-\n|Che Wilson\n|Te Wainuiarua-Whanganui\n|-\n|Herewini Parata\n|Ng\u0101ti Porou\n|-\n|Jerry Hapuku\n|Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu\n|-\n|Wharehoka Wano\n|Taranaki\n|-\n|(Vacant)\n|Taitokerau\n|-\n|''<u>'''Mema \u0100piti'''</u>''\n|''<u>'''Companion Members'''</u>''\n|-\n|Kataraina O\u2019Brien\n|M\u0101ori Women's Welfare League\n|-\n|Dame Iritana Tawhiwhirangi\n|Te K\u014dhanga Reo\n|-\n|Sir Taihakurei Durie\n|NZ M\u0101ori Council\n|}\n\n=== Te K\u0101hui Wairua ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''<u>Member</u>''\n!''<u>Karangatanga (Denomination)</u>''\n|-\n|Tumuaki Rev.
