With 31 people killed and 417 injured, it remains one of the worst rail accidents in Britain.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/11124741/Paddington-rail-disaster-Her-last-words-to-me-were-goodbye-Daddy.html|title=Paddington rail disaster: 'Her last words to me were goodbye, Daddy'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref> It was the second major accident on the Great Western Main Line in just over two years, the first being the [[Southall rail crash]] of September 1997, a few miles west of this accident. Both crashes would have been prevented by an operational [[automatic train protection]] (ATP) system, wider fitting of which had been rejected on cost grounds. This severely damaged public confidence in the management and regulation of safety of [[rail transport in Great Britain|Britain's privatised railway system]].\n\nA public inquiry into the crash by [[William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk|Lord Cullen]] was held in 2000. Since both the Paddington and Southall crashes had reopened public debate on ATP, a separate joint inquiry considering the issue in the light of both crashes was also held in 2000; it confirmed the rejection of ATP and the mandatory adoption of a cheaper and less effective system, but noted a mismatch between public opinion and [[cost-benefit analysis]]. The Cullen inquiry was carried out in two blocks of sittings, sandwiching the 'joint inquiry'; the first block dealt with the accident itself, the second block dealt with the management and regulation of UK railway safety; this had always been part of the inquiry terms of reference, but was given additional urgency by a further [[Hatfield train crash|train crash at Hatfield]] in October 2000.<ref>The inquiry report is in 2 volumes, reflecting this division; the narrative and the account of the most likely cause and identified shortcomings are based upon Volume 1 of the enquiry report</ref> Major changes in the formal responsibilities for management and regulation of safety of UK rail transport ensued.\n\n==Incident==\nAt about 08:06 [[British Summer Time|BST]] on 5 October 1999, a [[Thames Trains]] service to [[Bedwyn railway station]] in [[Wiltshire]] left [[Paddington Station]]. From Paddington to Ladbroke Grove Junction (about {{convert|2|mi}} to the west), the lines were bi-directional (signalled to allow trains to travel in either direction, in and out of the platforms of Paddington Station); beyond Ladbroke Grove the main line from London to [[South Wales]] and the [[West of England]] switched to the more conventional layout of two lines in each direction ('Up' for travel to London, 'Down' for travel away from London) carrying fast and slow trains. As an out-bound train, the train (a three-car [[British Rail Class 165|Class 165]] ''Turbo'' diesel multiple unit) would have been routed onto the Down Main line at Ladbroke Grove. It should have been held at a red signal at Portobello Junction until this could be done safely. Instead, it ran past the signal; the points settings beyond this brought it, in under 600 metres, onto the Up Main Line at Ladbroke Grove. At about 8:09, as it was entering that line, it collided nearly head-on and at a combined speed of about {{convert|130|mph}} with the 06:03 [[First Great Western]] train from [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham]] to Paddington.<ref>See section 3 of the Inquiry Report Volume 1</ref>\n\nThe latter train was a [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]], driven by 52-year-old Brian Cooper. It comprised eight [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coaches with a [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43]] diesel power car at each end. It was of much more substantial construction than the Turbo train, the leading car of which was totally destroyed. The diesel fuel carried by this train was dispersed by the collision and ignited in a fireball, causing a series of separate fires in the wreckage, particularly in coach H at the front of the HST, which was completely burnt out. The drivers of both trains involved were killed, as well as 29 others (24 on the Turbo train, six on the HST as a result of the impact, with a further fatality as a result of the fire), and 417 people were injured.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 paras 4.52\u20134.54, 4.57\u20134.59 (pp. 29\u201330)</ref> Underlining the speed, the body of the driver of the HST carrying 421 other people was ejected by the slight offset alignment of the centre of the vehicles in the head-on crash and rested beside a carriage which had been four coaches behind his cab.<ref>Para. 4.53 of the Inquiry Report Volume 1, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:09 014 Bf London Paddington, 43 186 Great Western.jpg|thumb|No. 43186 at London Paddington. This vehicle is in Great Western Trains livery, similar to the one involved in the accident.]]\n[[File:165119 at Didcot Parkway.JPG|thumb|No.165119 at {{Stnlnk|Didcot Parkway}}. The Thames Trains unit was painted in its original [[Network SouthEast]] livery similar to this one.]]\n\n==Immediate cause==\nThe immediate cause of the disaster was the Turbo train passing a red [[Railway signal|signal]] (numbered SN109 on gantry 8 overhead beside four signals serving other tracks) at which the train should have been stopped. The signal had been showing a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had been showing a single yellow which should have led the driver to be prepared for a red at SN109. Since the driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, it was not possible to establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver two weeks before the crash.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.51</ref> His driver training was found to be defective on at least two grounds: assessing situation-handling skills, and notifying of recent local incidents of Signals Passed at Danger (SPAD).<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.46</ref> The local signals were known to have caused mistakes \u2013 SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years,<ref>Counsel for Railtrack: \"One could say SN109 was a black spot\" Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.22</ref> but Hodder had no specific warning of this.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.43</ref> Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight reflecting off yellow aspects.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.81</ref><ref>A driver of a previous westbound train reported \"all the signals right the way across all lit up like a Christmas tree\" at gantry 6 at about 7:50 that morning (Inquiry Report Volume 1 para 5.62)</ref> Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.77</ref> The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting (sight lines) of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.111</ref> Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol-bound HST drivers had been re-routed not to pass the signal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Contributory factors==\nThe inquiry noted that the lines out of and into Paddington were known to be prone to '[[signal passed at danger]]' (SPAD) mishaps&mdash;hosting an unusual concentration of eight SPADs at signal SN109 in the preceding six years&mdash;and attempted to identify the underlying causes.\n\n===Problems with signal visibility===\nPaddington approaches had been resignalled by [[British Rail]] in the early 1990s to allow [[Double-track railway#Bi-directional running|bidirectional working]].<ref>Phase 1 commissioned July 1993: Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.4</ref>  The number of signals and limited trackside space meant that most signals were in gantries over the tracks;<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.4</ref> the curvature of the lines meant that it was not always obvious which signal was for which track.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.19</ref> Reflective line-identification signs had therefore been added but, the inquiry report noted,<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.17</ref> ''they were closer to the signal to the right hand side than to the signal for the line to which they related''. However, misreading of which signal related to which track cannot have caused the fatal crash, because at the time all the other gantry 8 signals westbound were also showing red.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 3.19</ref>\nLocal spacing between signals and points was designed to allow fast through-running by freight trains,<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.10</ref> such that gantry 8 was less than 100&nbsp;m west of a road bridge not at high level;<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.12</ref> this compromised the distance from which the signal could be seen by drivers of trains leaving Paddington. To allow the higher ('proceed') aspects to be seen sooner, the standard signals (with the four aspects arranged vertically) were replaced with non-standard 'reverse L' signals, with the red aspect to the left of the lower yellow.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.15</ref> The resignalling had been implemented ahead of formal [[Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate|HMRI]] approval; awaited at the time of the crash.<ref>partly because HMRI did not want to take a view until prosecutions arising out of the Southall crash had been resolved: Inquiry Report vol 1, para 10.9</ref>\n\nThe line had been electrified to allow the new [[Heathrow Express]] service to operate from 1994 with overhead electrification equipment that further obstructed drivers' view of signals:<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.16</ref>\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;from the outset there was not an adequate overall consideration of the difficulties which would face drivers, in particular in signal sighting, on which the safety of travellers critically depended. Secondly, when difficulties did emerge, there was not an adequate reconsideration of the scheme. There was a resistance to questioning what had already been done. Cost, delay and interference with the performance objectives underlay that resistance.</blockquote>\n\nThe red aspect of SN109 was particularly badly obscured by the overhead electrification equipment; it was last of all the gantry 8 signal aspects to become clearly visible to the driver of a Class 165 approaching from Paddington.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.74</ref>\n\n===Problems with signal visibility management===\nAll new or altered signals<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.31</ref> or which had had multiple SPADs<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.38</ref> should have been reviewed for sighting issues by a 'signal sighting committee', but none had been held for signals around Paddington since [[Railtrack]] assumed responsibility for this in April 1994. An internal audit in March 1999 had reported this, but a follow-up audit in September 1999 found no evidence of any remedial action being taken.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.42</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The failure to have signal sighting committees convened was persistent and serious. It was due ... to a combination of incompetent management<ref>the Report speaks of 'a culture of apathy and lack of will to follow up promised actions' Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.41</ref> and inadequate process, the latter consisting in the absence of a process at a higher level for identifying whether those who were responsible for convening such committees were or were not doing so.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.45</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere had been over the years a number of proposals or recommendations for the risk assessment of the signalling in the Paddington area; none of them was carried into effect.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.47</ref> Multiple SPADs at SN109 in August 1998 should have triggered a risk assessment; none took place. An inquiry into a February 1998 SPAD at SN109 had already recommended risk assessment of signalling on the Paddington\u2013Ladbroke Grove bi-directional lines; this and many other inquiry recommendations had not been implemented:<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.96</ref> the Railtrack employee with formal responsibility for action-tracking had been told his responsibility ended once someone accepted an action, and did not extend to checking that they had acted upon it.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.103</ref>\n\n==='Disjointed and ineffective' SPAD reduction initiatives===\nBetween February 1998 and the accident there had been four separate groups set up with the aim of reducing SPADs; their existence, membership and functions overlapped.<ref name=\"Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.107\">Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.107</ref> A Railtrack manager told the inquiry how he struggled on his arrival in October 1998 to understand how \"so many apparently good people could produce so little action\": people had burdens that were too complex; they were not prioritising; people were \"square pegs in round holes\"; some were not competent; and, in summary, \"the culture of the place had gone seriously adrift over many years\".<ref name=\"Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.107\"/> The chief executive of Railtrack spoke of a seemingly endemic culture of complacency and inaction, which he said reflected the culture of the old [[British Rail]]:\n\"The culture is one in which decisions are delegated upwards. There has been little empowerment. People have tended to manage reactively, not proactively. The basic management discipline of 'plan-do-review' is absent the further down the organisation one goes.\"<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.115; whilst conversely the HSE blamed a move away from British Rail behaviours for their failure to regulate effectively; the evidence points to the Railtrack culture 'falling between two stools'</ref>\n\n===Problems with driver training===\nThames Trains inherited a driver training programme from British Rail,<ref>\"Driver 2000\" [http://www.rssb.co.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/pdf/reports/research/T718_trng_rpt.pdf: Research Programme Management Review of driver training programmes in Great Britain railways Locomotion No.1 to simulation: A brief history of train driver training on Britain\u2019s railways] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919005734/https://www.rssb.co.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/pdf/reports/research/T718_trng_rpt.pdf: |date=19 September 2017 }}</ref> which had changed to the point where in February 1999, a concerned incoming training manager commissioned an external audit which reported<ref>May 1999: Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.31</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The trainers did not appear to be following the training course syllabus and supporting notes as they considered these to be 'not fit for purpose' with inappropriate time allowances for some sessions. The traction and introduction to driving section of the course has been extended and the six week [[Route knowledge (rail)|route learning]] session is being used as additional practical handling.</blockquote>\n\nIndeed, Michael Hodder's 16 weeks' practical training had been given by a trainer who felt that \"I was not there to teach ... the routes. I was totally to teach ... how to drive a Turbo\"; the training manager was unaware of this.<ref name=\"Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.48\">Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.48</ref> Details of signals which had been repeatedly passed at danger should have been supplied to trainers and passed on to trainees; no trainer had done so,<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.43</ref> and the practical trainer quoted above was unaware that SN109 was a multi-SPAD signal.<ref name=\"Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.48\"/> Testing of trainees was similarly unstructured and unstandardised, with no clear pass/fail criteria.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.45</ref> Under the previous British Railways training regime, trainees would have spent far longer in training and once qualified, were not allowed to drive over the notoriously difficult approach to/from Paddington until they had at least two years' experience on less complex routes.<ref>Vaughn 2003</ref> Hodder had only qualified 13 days earlier; he was ex-navy with no previous experience as a railway worker, but no special attention was paid to this in either training or testing.<ref>Locomotion No.1 to simulation ''op. cit.''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It must be concluded therefore that [the driver's] training was not adequate for the task for which he was being prepared. The very favourable comments made as to his progress by his various teachers have to be viewed against the background that his teachers were working with a less than perfect training programme.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.46</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Other issues==\n\n===Train protection===\nThe Class 165 unit had been fitted with an [[Automatic Warning System]] (AWS) which required the driver to acknowledge a warning every time he approached a signal not at green. If an [[Automatic Train Protection]] (ATP) system had been fitted and working it would have automatically applied brakes to prevent the train going beyond any signal at red.  National adoption of ATP, British Rail's preferred train protection system, had been recommended after the [[Clapham Junction rail crash]], but later abandoned because the safety benefits were considered not great enough to justify the cost.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 8.3\u20135</ref> After a previous SPAD, Thames Trains had commissioned a [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] (CBA) study specific to the Paddington situation which came to the same conclusion.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 8.10\u201324</ref> The Ladbroke Grove accident was felt to cast doubt on the wisdom of these decisions.  However, the Cullen inquiry confirmed that CBA would not support the adoption of ATP by Thames Trains.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 8.50\u201354, which however suggest that CBA should not be the sole input into the decision</ref>\n\n===Flank protection===\nThe signalling system on the approaches to Paddington did not incorporate '[[flank protection]]' (where the points beyond a stop signal are automatically set to direct the train away from the path which would cause a collision). This would have routed the train running past SN109 onto the Down Relief line.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 7.18</ref> This should have been considered at the design stage. The reasons for not engineering flank protection were not known but it was noted that the introduction of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) had been thought to be imminent at previous safety reviews.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 7.20</ref> Flank protection would have increased the 'overlap' (the distance for which a train could run past the signal before fouling lines) at SN109; the desirability of doing so should have been considered by the risk assessment which had not taken place.\n\n===Response of signalmen===\nThe written instructions for Railtrack signalling centre staff at [[Slough]] were that as soon as they realised that a train had passed a signal at danger they should set signals to danger and immediately send a radio \"emergency all stop\" signal to the driver of the train by [[Cab Secure Radio]] (CSR) as soon as they realised that it had done so.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 6.28 -30</ref> In the event, only when the Thames train was 200m past the signal did they start to send a radio \"emergency all stop\" signal (it is not clear<ref>\"The inconsistencies of the evidence of the signallers raise questions as to the reliability, and even the credibility, of some of that evidence\".Inquiry Report vol 1, para 6.25</ref> whether the signal was actually sent before the crash).  Their understanding of the instructions was that they should wait to see if the driver stopped of his own accord before attempting to contact him; this interpretation was supported by their immediate manager.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 6.40</ref> The signalmen had never been trained in the use of CSR, nor had they ever used it in response to a SPAD.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 6.31 -37</ref>\n<blockquote>The general picture which emerged was of a slack and complacent regime, which was not alive to the potentially dire consequences of a SPAD or of the way in which signallers could take action to deal with such situations.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 6.41</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Regulatory shortcomings===\nThe [[Health and Safety Executive]]'s [[HM Railway Inspectorate]] was also criticised for its inspection procedures.\nThe then head of HSE told the Inquiry<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 10.17\u201318</ref> the HSE were concerned about, first, the length of time taken for the approval of the signalling scheme; secondly, the slow progress by Railtrack and the HMRI in bringing issues to a conclusion; and, thirdly, the inadequate risk analysis.  Matters had not been followed up with more urgency. More could have been done to enforce health and safety legislation. She attributed these deficiencies to three causes:\n* a lack of resources on the part of the HMRI;\n* a lack of vigour by the HMRI in pursuing issues; and\n* the placing of too much trust in the duty holders<ref>specifically that it had been assumed that \u2018as with BR\u2019 there would be openness with the regulator and delivery on promises Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 10.21</ref>\n\n==Wider ramifications==\n\n===National policy on train protection systems===\nA fortnight before the accident the HSE had announced an intention to require the adoption of [[Train Protection & Warning System|TPWS]] (an upgrade of AWS, which could stop trains travelling at less than 70&nbsp;mph within the overlap distance of a red signal delivering it assessed about {{frac|2|3}} the safety benefits of ATP at much lower cost) by 2004 (advanced, a week after the accident, to 2003<ref>although, as the joint inquiry noted, 2004 had been regarded as the best achievable; this acceleration was done ''in the light of strong public criticism of railway management''</ref>).\n\nThe separate joint inquiry on the problem nationally noted that ATP and contrasting AWS introduced since about 1958 (and therefore TPWS) had continuing reliability problems and were obsolescent technology inconsistent with the impending standardisation EU-wide per the ETCS [[European Train Control System]]. In the year between Ladbroke Grove and the joint inquiry the rail industry (if not the general public) had become largely committed to the adoption of TPWS. Consequently, although the joint inquiry expressed ''considerable reservations about the effectiveness of TPWS'' it concurred with its adoption.<ref>And concurred, expressly denying its hands were tied.</ref>\n\nThe joint inquiry noted that ''public reaction to catastrophic rail accidents ... should be and is taken into account in the making of decisions about rail safety'' but did not align with the output of CBA (cost-benefits analysis). ''Any future ATP<ref>here ATP meaning any train protection system; the joint inquiry referred to the ex-British Rail ATP as 'BR-ATP'</ref> system will entail expenditure at levels many times higher than that indicated by any approach based upon CBA. Despite its cost, there appears to be a general consensus in favour of ATP''. Both TPWS and ETCS would be mandatory and therefore their cost implications need not be considered by any body other than the UK government and the EU Commission.\n\n===Management and regulation of rail safety===\nThe inquiry noted evidence that railway safety statistics had not worsened after privatisation, nor had there been any evidence that however privatisation had been carried out it would have been detrimental to safety.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 paras 4.5\u20136</ref> Concerns were however expressed about how privatisation had been carried out:\n* The fragmentation of the industry had created numerous, complex interfaces exacerbated by defensive or insular attitudes (expected to worsen in the future as managers who had broad, sobering experience in BR passed out of the system). It also gave problems with the management, development and implementation of large-scale projects; and meant that little real research and development was being carried out.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 para 4.20</ref>\n* The quality of safety leadership and communications varied between the various successor organisations.\n* A stress on performance targets had diluted the perceived importance of safety. Cullen contrasted multimillion-pound penalties for poor punctuality with much lower fines for serious safety breaches.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 para 4.18</ref>\n*Train Operating Company (TOC) franchises had been awarded for too short a period, and with inadequate consideration of safety aspects.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 para 4.60</ref>\n*Railtrack relied extensively on contractors to carry out safety critical work; there were too many contracting organisations, contracts were for too short a period, and were inadequately supervised by Railtrack.\n\nBeyond exhortations to do better, the Inquiry recommended changes in the industry structure.\nRailtrack had not merely had responsibility for railways infrastructure, but also a lead responsibility for safety: for acceptance of the Safety Case of each TOC and for setting \"Railway Group Standards\" (system-wide standards on matters affecting safety). Since it also had commercial interests in these issues TOCs were unhappy with this:<ref>For example \"ATOC cited as an example of potential conflict the requirement that had been made in April 2000 that train operators should fit sanders to all their trains. They pointed out that problems with low adhesion were commercially disadvantageous to Railtrack.\" Inquiry Report part 2 para 8.27</ref> Cullen recommended that safety case acceptance should be directly by HSE in future, and a new body should be set up to manage Railway Group Standards.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 Chapter 8</ref>\n\nIn 1996 [[ScotRail (British Rail)|ScotRail]] had initiated the creation of a confidential rail safety reporting system (later to become CIRAS) formed from an independent panel chiefly from [[Strathclyde University]]. Other TOCs expressed interest and others in Scotland voluntarily joined the system. Following the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] mandated that all mainline rail in the UK come under the [[Confidential Incident Reporting & Analysis System (CIRAS)]] to involve every rail employee in the rail safety process.<ref name=\"Improving Safety\">{{Google books|DlgaHNs3EjoC|Improving Safety-related Rules Compliance in the Public Transportation Industry|page=PA105}} {{ISBN|030921355X}}</ref> CIRAS now provides services to all rail workers and operating sectors throughout England, Scotland and Wales.<ref name=\"urlCIRAS - about\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.ciras.org.uk/about-ciras/\n |title       = CIRAS \u2013 the rail industry's confidential reporting system\n |accessdate  = 2013-03-14\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130308170207/http://www.ciras.org.uk/about-ciras\n |archivedate = 8 March 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref name=\"RHF38-History\">{{Google books|E7ZHl7DjEFgC| Rail Human Factors: Supporting the Integrated Railway|page=Chapter 38}} {{ISBN|0754643824}}</ref>\n\nThe Railways Inspectorate had a responsibility for advising on and inspecting against matters affecting railway safety; they were also the usual investigating body for serious railway accidents.

Kingdom. With 31 people killed and 417 injured, it remains one of the worst rail accidents in Britain.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/11124741/Paddington-rail-disaster-Her-last-words-to-me-were-goodbye-Daddy.html|title=Paddington rail disaster: 'Her last words to me were goodbye, Daddy'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref> It was the second major accident on the Great Western Main Line in just over two years, the first being the [[Southall rail crash]] of September 1997, a few miles west of this accident. Both crashes would have been prevented by an operational [[automatic train protection]] (ATP) system, wider fitting of which had been rejected on cost grounds. This severely damaged public confidence in the management and regulation of safety of [[rail transport in Great Britain|Britain's privatised railway system]].\n\nA public inquiry into the crash by [[William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk|Lord Cullen]] was held in 2000. Since both the Paddington and Southall crashes had reopened public debate on ATP, a separate joint inquiry considering the issue in the light of both crashes was also held in 2000; it confirmed the rejection of ATP and the mandatory adoption of a cheaper and less effective system, but noted a mismatch between public opinion and [[cost-benefit analysis]]. The Cullen inquiry was carried out in two blocks of sittings, sandwiching the 'joint inquiry'; the first block dealt with the accident itself, the second block dealt with the management and regulation of UK railway safety; this had always been part of the inquiry terms of reference, but was given additional urgency by a further [[Hatfield train crash|train crash at Hatfield]] in October 2000.<ref>The inquiry report is in 2 volumes, reflecting this division; the narrative and the account of the most likely cause and identified shortcomings are based upon Volume 1 of the enquiry report</ref> Major changes in the formal responsibilities for management and regulation of safety of UK rail transport ensued.\n\n==Incident==\nAt about 08:06 [[British Summer Time|BST]] on 5 October 1999, a [[Thames Trains]] service to [[Bedwyn railway station]] in [[Wiltshire]] left [[Paddington Station]]. From Paddington to Ladbroke Grove Junction (about {{convert|2|mi}} to the west), the lines were bi-directional (signalled to allow trains to travel in either direction, in and out of the platforms of Paddington Station); beyond Ladbroke Grove the main line from London to [[South Wales]] and the [[West of England]] switched to the more conventional layout of two lines in each direction ('Up' for travel to London, 'Down' for travel away from London) carrying fast and slow trains. As an out-bound train, the train (a three-car [[British Rail Class 165|Class 165]] ''Turbo'' diesel multiple unit) would have been routed onto the Down Main line at Ladbroke Grove. It should have been held at a red signal at Portobello Junction until this could be done safely. Instead, it ran past the signal; the points settings beyond this brought it, in under 600 metres, onto the Up Main Line at Ladbroke Grove. At about 8:09, as it was entering that line, it collided nearly head-on and at a combined speed of about {{convert|130|mph}} with the 06:03 [[First Great Western]] train from [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham]] to Paddington.<ref>See section 3 of the Inquiry Report Volume 1</ref>\n\nThe latter train was a [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]], driven by 52-year-old Brian Cooper. It comprised eight [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coaches with a [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43]] diesel power car at each end. It was of much more substantial construction than the Turbo train, the leading car of which was totally destroyed. The diesel fuel carried by this train was dispersed by the collision and ignited in a fireball, causing a series of separate fires in the wreckage, particularly in coach H at the front of the HST, which was completely burnt out. The drivers of both trains involved were killed, as well as 29 others (24 on the Turbo train, six on the HST as a result of the impact, with a further fatality as a result of the fire), and 417 people were injured.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 paras 4.52\u20134.54, 4.57\u20134.59 (pp. 29\u201330)</ref> Underlining the speed, the body of the driver of the HST carrying 421 other people was ejected by the slight offset alignment of the centre of the vehicles in the head-on crash and rested beside a carriage which had been four coaches behind his cab.<ref>Para. 4.53 of the Inquiry Report Volume 1, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:09 014 Bf London Paddington, 43 186 Great Western.jpg|thumb|No. 43186 at London Paddington.

The Thames Trains unit was painted in its original [[Network SouthEast]] livery similar to this one.]]\n\n==Immediate cause==\nThe immediate cause of the disaster was the Turbo train passing a red [[Railway signal|signal]] (numbered SN109 on gantry 8 overhead beside four signals serving other tracks) at which the train should have been stopped. The signal had been showing a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had been showing a single yellow which should have led the driver to be prepared for a red at SN109. Since the driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, it was not possible to establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver two weeks before the crash.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.51</ref> His driver training was found to be defective on at least two grounds: assessing situation-handling skills, and notifying of recent local incidents of Signals Passed at Danger (SPAD).<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.46</ref> The local signals were known to have caused mistakes \u2013 SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years,<ref>Counsel for Railtrack: \"One could say SN109 was a black spot\" Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.22</ref> but Hodder had no specific warning of this.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.43</ref> Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight reflecting off yellow aspects.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.81</ref><ref>A driver of a previous westbound train reported \"all the signals right the way across all lit up like a Christmas tree\" at gantry 6 at about 7:50 that morning (Inquiry Report Volume 1 para 5.62)</ref> Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.77</ref> The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting (sight lines) of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.111</ref> Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol-bound HST drivers had been re-routed not to pass the signal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Contributory factors==\nThe inquiry noted that the lines out of and into Paddington were known to be prone to '[[signal passed at danger]]' (SPAD) mishaps&mdash;hosting an unusual concentration of eight SPADs at signal SN109 in the preceding six years&mdash;and attempted to identify the underlying causes.\n\n===Problems with signal visibility===\nPaddington approaches had been resignalled by [[British Rail]] in the early 1990s to allow [[Double-track railway#Bi-directional running|bidirectional working]].<ref>Phase 1 commissioned July 1993: Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.4</ref>  The number of signals and limited trackside space meant that most signals were in gantries over the tracks;<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.4</ref> the curvature of the lines meant that it was not always obvious which signal was for which track.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.19</ref> Reflective line-identification signs had therefore been added but, the inquiry report noted,<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.17</ref> ''they were closer to the signal to the right hand side than to the signal for the line to which they related''. However, misreading of which signal related to which track cannot have caused the fatal crash, because at the time all the other gantry 8 signals westbound were also showing red.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 3.19</ref>\nLocal spacing between signals and points was designed to allow fast through-running by freight trains,<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.10</ref> such that gantry 8 was less than 100&nbsp;m west of a road bridge not at high level;<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.12</ref> this compromised the distance from which the signal could be seen by drivers of trains leaving Paddington. To allow the higher ('proceed') aspects to be seen sooner, the standard signals (with the four aspects arranged vertically) were replaced with non-standard 'reverse L' signals, with the red aspect to the left of the lower yellow.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.15</ref> The resignalling had been implemented ahead of formal [[Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate|HMRI]] approval; awaited at the time of the crash.<ref>partly because HMRI did not want to take a view until prosecutions arising out of the Southall crash had been resolved: Inquiry Report vol 1, para 10.9</ref>\n\nThe line had been electrified to allow the new [[Heathrow Express]] service to operate from 1994 with overhead electrification equipment that further obstructed drivers' view of signals:<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.16</ref>\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;from the outset there was not an adequate overall consideration of the difficulties which would face drivers, in particular in signal sighting, on which the safety of travellers critically depended. Secondly, when difficulties did emerge, there was not an adequate reconsideration of the scheme. There was a resistance to questioning what had already been done. Cost, delay and interference with the performance objectives underlay that resistance.</blockquote>\n\nThe red aspect of SN109 was particularly badly obscured by the overhead electrification equipment; it was last of all the gantry 8 signal aspects to become clearly visible to the driver of a Class 165 approaching from Paddington.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 5.74</ref>\n\n===Problems with signal visibility management===\nAll new or altered signals<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.31</ref> or which had had multiple SPADs<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.38</ref> should have been reviewed for sighting issues by a 'signal sighting committee', but none had been held for signals around Paddington since [[Railtrack]] assumed responsibility for this in April 1994. An internal audit in March 1999 had reported this, but a follow-up audit in September 1999 found no evidence of any remedial action being taken.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.42</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The failure to have signal sighting committees convened was persistent and serious. It was due ... to a combination of incompetent management<ref>the Report speaks of 'a culture of apathy and lack of will to follow up promised actions' Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.41</ref> and inadequate process, the latter consisting in the absence of a process at a higher level for identifying whether those who were responsible for convening such committees were or were not doing so.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.45</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere had been over the years a number of proposals or recommendations for the risk assessment of the signalling in the Paddington area; none of them was carried into effect.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.47</ref> Multiple SPADs at SN109 in August 1998 should have triggered a risk assessment; none took place. An inquiry into a February 1998 SPAD at SN109 had already recommended risk assessment of signalling on the Paddington\u2013Ladbroke Grove bi-directional lines; this and many other inquiry recommendations had not been implemented:<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.96</ref> the Railtrack employee with formal responsibility for action-tracking had been told his responsibility ended once someone accepted an action, and did not extend to checking that they had acted upon it.<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.103</ref>\n\n==='Disjointed and ineffective' SPAD reduction initiatives===\nBetween February 1998 and the accident there had been four separate groups set up with the aim of reducing SPADs; their existence, membership and functions overlapped.<ref name=\"Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.107\">Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.107</ref> A Railtrack manager told the inquiry how he struggled on his arrival in October 1998 to understand how \"so many apparently good people could produce so little action\": people had burdens that were too complex; they were not prioritising; people were \"square pegs in round holes\"; some were not competent; and, in summary, \"the culture of the place had gone seriously adrift over many years\".<ref name=\"Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.107\"/> The chief executive of Railtrack spoke of a seemingly endemic culture of complacency and inaction, which he said reflected the culture of the old [[British Rail]]:\n\"The culture is one in which decisions are delegated upwards. There has been little empowerment. People have tended to manage reactively, not proactively. The basic management discipline of 'plan-do-review' is absent the further down the organisation one goes.\"<ref>Inquiry Report Vol 1 para 7.115; whilst conversely the HSE blamed a move away from British Rail behaviours for their failure to regulate effectively; the evidence points to the Railtrack culture 'falling between two stools'</ref>\n\n===Problems with driver training===\nThames Trains inherited a driver training programme from British Rail,<ref>\"Driver 2000\" [http://www.rssb.co.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/pdf/reports/research/T718_trng_rpt.pdf: Research Programme Management Review of driver training programmes in Great Britain railways Locomotion No.1 to simulation: A brief history of train driver training on Britain\u2019s railways] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919005734/https://www.rssb.co.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/pdf/reports/research/T718_trng_rpt.pdf: |date=19 September 2017 }}</ref> which had changed to the point where in February 1999, a concerned incoming training manager commissioned an external audit which reported<ref>May 1999: Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.31</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The trainers did not appear to be following the training course syllabus and supporting notes as they considered these to be 'not fit for purpose' with inappropriate time allowances for some sessions. The traction and introduction to driving section of the course has been extended and the six week [[Route knowledge (rail)|route learning]] session is being used as additional practical handling.</blockquote>\n\nIndeed, Michael Hodder's 16 weeks' practical training had been given by a trainer who felt that \"I was not there to teach ... the routes. I was totally to teach ... how to drive a Turbo\"; the training manager was unaware of this.<ref name=\"Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.48\">Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.48</ref> Details of signals which had been repeatedly passed at danger should have been supplied to trainers and passed on to trainees; no trainer had done so,<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.43</ref> and the practical trainer quoted above was unaware that SN109 was a multi-SPAD signal.<ref name=\"Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.48\"/> Testing of trainees was similarly unstructured and unstandardised, with no clear pass/fail criteria.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.45</ref> Under the previous British Railways training regime, trainees would have spent far longer in training and once qualified, were not allowed to drive over the notoriously difficult approach to/from Paddington until they had at least two years' experience on less complex routes.<ref>Vaughn 2003</ref> Hodder had only qualified 13 days earlier; he was ex-navy with no previous experience as a railway worker, but no special attention was paid to this in either training or testing.<ref>Locomotion No.1 to simulation ''op. cit.''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It must be concluded therefore that [the driver's] training was not adequate for the task for which he was being prepared. The very favourable comments made as to his progress by his various teachers have to be viewed against the background that his teachers were working with a less than perfect training programme.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 5.46</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Other issues==\n\n===Train protection===\nThe Class 165 unit had been fitted with an [[Automatic Warning System]] (AWS) which required the driver to acknowledge a warning every time he approached a signal not at green. If an [[Automatic Train Protection]] (ATP) system had been fitted and working it would have automatically applied brakes to prevent the train going beyond any signal at red.  National adoption of ATP, British Rail's preferred train protection system, had been recommended after the [[Clapham Junction rail crash]], but later abandoned because the safety benefits were considered not great enough to justify the cost.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 8.3\u20135</ref> After a previous SPAD, Thames Trains had commissioned a [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] (CBA) study specific to the Paddington situation which came to the same conclusion.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 8.10\u201324</ref> The Ladbroke Grove accident was felt to cast doubt on the wisdom of these decisions.  However, the Cullen inquiry confirmed that CBA would not support the adoption of ATP by Thames Trains.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 8.50\u201354, which however suggest that CBA should not be the sole input into the decision</ref>\n\n===Flank protection===\nThe signalling system on the approaches to Paddington did not incorporate '[[flank protection]]' (where the points beyond a stop signal are automatically set to direct the train away from the path which would cause a collision). This would have routed the train running past SN109 onto the Down Relief line.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 7.18</ref> This should have been considered at the design stage. The reasons for not engineering flank protection were not known but it was noted that the introduction of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) had been thought to be imminent at previous safety reviews.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 7.20</ref> Flank protection would have increased the 'overlap' (the distance for which a train could run past the signal before fouling lines) at SN109; the desirability of doing so should have been considered by the risk assessment which had not taken place.\n\n===Response of signalmen===\nThe written instructions for Railtrack signalling centre staff at [[Slough]] were that as soon as they realised that a train had passed a signal at danger they should set signals to danger and immediately send a radio \"emergency all stop\" signal to the driver of the train by [[Cab Secure Radio]] (CSR) as soon as they realised that it had done so.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 6.28 -30</ref> In the event, only when the Thames train was 200m past the signal did they start to send a radio \"emergency all stop\" signal (it is not clear<ref>\"The inconsistencies of the evidence of the signallers raise questions as to the reliability, and even the credibility, of some of that evidence\".Inquiry Report vol 1, para 6.25</ref> whether the signal was actually sent before the crash).  Their understanding of the instructions was that they should wait to see if the driver stopped of his own accord before attempting to contact him; this interpretation was supported by their immediate manager.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 6.40</ref> The signalmen had never been trained in the use of CSR, nor had they ever used it in response to a SPAD.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 6.31 -37</ref>\n<blockquote>The general picture which emerged was of a slack and complacent regime, which was not alive to the potentially dire consequences of a SPAD or of the way in which signallers could take action to deal with such situations.<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, para 6.41</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Regulatory shortcomings===\nThe [[Health and Safety Executive]]'s [[HM Railway Inspectorate]] was also criticised for its inspection procedures.\nThe then head of HSE told the Inquiry<ref>Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 10.17\u201318</ref> the HSE were concerned about, first, the length of time taken for the approval of the signalling scheme; secondly, the slow progress by Railtrack and the HMRI in bringing issues to a conclusion; and, thirdly, the inadequate risk analysis.  Matters had not been followed up with more urgency. More could have been done to enforce health and safety legislation. She attributed these deficiencies to three causes:\n* a lack of resources on the part of the HMRI;\n* a lack of vigour by the HMRI in pursuing issues; and\n* the placing of too much trust in the duty holders<ref>specifically that it had been assumed that \u2018as with BR\u2019 there would be openness with the regulator and delivery on promises Inquiry Report vol 1, paras 10.21</ref>\n\n==Wider ramifications==\n\n===National policy on train protection systems===\nA fortnight before the accident the HSE had announced an intention to require the adoption of [[Train Protection & Warning System|TPWS]] (an upgrade of AWS, which could stop trains travelling at less than 70&nbsp;mph within the overlap distance of a red signal delivering it assessed about {{frac|2|3}} the safety benefits of ATP at much lower cost) by 2004 (advanced, a week after the accident, to 2003<ref>although, as the joint inquiry noted, 2004 had been regarded as the best achievable; this acceleration was done ''in the light of strong public criticism of railway management''</ref>).\n\nThe separate joint inquiry on the problem nationally noted that ATP and contrasting AWS introduced since about 1958 (and therefore TPWS) had continuing reliability problems and were obsolescent technology inconsistent with the impending standardisation EU-wide per the ETCS [[European Train Control System]]. In the year between Ladbroke Grove and the joint inquiry the rail industry (if not the general public) had become largely committed to the adoption of TPWS. Consequently, although the joint inquiry expressed ''considerable reservations about the effectiveness of TPWS'' it concurred with its adoption.<ref>And concurred, expressly denying its hands were tied.</ref>\n\nThe joint inquiry noted that ''public reaction to catastrophic rail accidents ... should be and is taken into account in the making of decisions about rail safety'' but did not align with the output of CBA (cost-benefits analysis). ''Any future ATP<ref>here ATP meaning any train protection system; the joint inquiry referred to the ex-British Rail ATP as 'BR-ATP'</ref> system will entail expenditure at levels many times higher than that indicated by any approach based upon CBA. Despite its cost, there appears to be a general consensus in favour of ATP''. Both TPWS and ETCS would be mandatory and therefore their cost implications need not be considered by any body other than the UK government and the EU Commission.\n\n===Management and regulation of rail safety===\nThe inquiry noted evidence that railway safety statistics had not worsened after privatisation, nor had there been any evidence that however privatisation had been carried out it would have been detrimental to safety.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 paras 4.5\u20136</ref> Concerns were however expressed about how privatisation had been carried out:\n* The fragmentation of the industry had created numerous, complex interfaces exacerbated by defensive or insular attitudes (expected to worsen in the future as managers who had broad, sobering experience in BR passed out of the system). It also gave problems with the management, development and implementation of large-scale projects; and meant that little real research and development was being carried out.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 para 4.20</ref>\n* The quality of safety leadership and communications varied between the various successor organisations.\n* A stress on performance targets had diluted the perceived importance of safety. Cullen contrasted multimillion-pound penalties for poor punctuality with much lower fines for serious safety breaches.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 para 4.18</ref>\n*Train Operating Company (TOC) franchises had been awarded for too short a period, and with inadequate consideration of safety aspects.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 para 4.60</ref>\n*Railtrack relied extensively on contractors to carry out safety critical work; there were too many contracting organisations, contracts were for too short a period, and were inadequately supervised by Railtrack.\n\nBeyond exhortations to do better, the Inquiry recommended changes in the industry structure.\nRailtrack had not merely had responsibility for railways infrastructure, but also a lead responsibility for safety: for acceptance of the Safety Case of each TOC and for setting \"Railway Group Standards\" (system-wide standards on matters affecting safety). Since it also had commercial interests in these issues TOCs were unhappy with this:<ref>For example \"ATOC cited as an example of potential conflict the requirement that had been made in April 2000 that train operators should fit sanders to all their trains. They pointed out that problems with low adhesion were commercially disadvantageous to Railtrack.\" Inquiry Report part 2 para 8.27</ref> Cullen recommended that safety case acceptance should be directly by HSE in future, and a new body should be set up to manage Railway Group Standards.<ref>Inquiry Report part 2 Chapter 8</ref>\n\nIn 1996 [[ScotRail (British Rail)|ScotRail]] had initiated the creation of a confidential rail safety reporting system (later to become CIRAS) formed from an independent panel chiefly from [[Strathclyde University]]. Other TOCs expressed interest and others in Scotland voluntarily joined the system. Following the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] mandated that all mainline rail in the UK come under the [[Confidential Incident Reporting & Analysis System (CIRAS)]] to involve every rail employee in the rail safety process.<ref name=\"Improving Safety\">{{Google books|DlgaHNs3EjoC|Improving Safety-related Rules Compliance in the Public Transportation Industry|page=PA105}} {{ISBN|030921355X}}</ref> CIRAS now provides services to all rail workers and operating sectors throughout England, Scotland and Wales.<ref name=\"urlCIRAS - about\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.ciras.org.uk/about-ciras/\n |title       = CIRAS \u2013 the rail industry's confidential reporting system\n |accessdate  = 2013-03-14\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130308170207/http://www.ciras.org.uk/about-ciras\n |archivedate = 8 March 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref name=\"RHF38-History\">{{Google books|E7ZHl7DjEFgC| Rail Human Factors: Supporting the Integrated Railway|page=Chapter 38}} {{ISBN|0754643824}}</ref>\n\nThe Railways Inspectorate had a responsibility for advising on and inspecting against matters affecting railway safety; they were also the usual investigating body for serious railway accidents.

The NTSB determined that the flight crew mismanaged the initial approach and that the airplane was well above the desired glidepath. In response, the captain selected an inappropriate autopilot mode (FLCH, or Flight Level Change) that, without the captain's awareness, resulted in the autothrottle no longer controlling airspeed. The aircraft then descended below the desired glidepath with the crew unaware of the decreasing airspeed. The attempted go-around was conducted below 100&nbsp;feet, by which time it was too late. Over-reliance on automation and lack of systems understanding by the pilots were cited as major factors contributing to the accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625133742/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB further determined that the pilot's faulty mental model of the airplane's automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage manual flight during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of increased workload that reduced the monitoring pilot's awareness of the flying pilot's actions around the time of the unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, increased workload, fatigue, and automation reliance.  Lack of compliance with [[standard operating procedure]]s and [[crew resource management]] were cited as additional factors.<ref name=\"ntsb.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html|title=Crash of Asiana Flight 214 Accident Report Summary |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625051127/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB reached the following final conclusion:\n\n{{quote|The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the flight crew's inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the flight crew's delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances. Contributing to the accident were (1) the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's  pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) the flight crew's nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and (5) flight crew fatigue, which likely degraded their performance.<ref name=\"AAR-14-01 Final Report\"/>{{rp|129}}}}\n\n=== Timeline of the accident ===\n[[File:Asiana Flight 214 Crash NTSB Animation.ogv|thumb|NTSB animation reconstructing the failed descent]]\n[[File:NTSBAsiana214MapFlightOverview.jpg|thumb|Descent flight path]]\nAccording to the NTSB, the weather was fair and the aircraft was cleared for a visual approach.<ref name=\"NYTimesWater\"/><ref name=\"YoutubeNTSB070813\"/>\n\nThe [[instrument landing system]]'s vertical guidance (glide slope) on runway 28L was out of service, as scheduled, beginning on June 1 (and a [[NOTAM|Notice To Airmen]] (NOTAM) to that effect had been issued);<ref>{{cite web|title=KSFO San Francisco Intl |work=PilotWeb |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |quote=06/005 SFO navigation instrument landing system Runway 28L glide path out of service with effect from or effective from 1306011400-1308222359 |url=https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |accessdate=July 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929162007/https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> therefore, a precision [[Instrument approach|ILS approach]] to this runway was not possible.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicated that the plane's approach was too slow and too low.

The NTSB determined that the flight crew mismanaged the initial approach and that the airplane was well above the desired glidepath. In response, the captain selected an inappropriate autopilot mode (FLCH, or Flight Level Change) that, without the captain's awareness, resulted in the autothrottle no longer controlling airspeed. The aircraft then descended below the desired glidepath with the crew unaware of the decreasing airspeed. The attempted go-around was conducted below 100&nbsp;feet, by which time it was too late. Over-reliance on automation and lack of systems understanding by the pilots were cited as major factors contributing to the accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625133742/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB further determined that the pilot's faulty mental model of the airplane's automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage manual flight during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of increased workload that reduced the monitoring pilot's awareness of the flying pilot's actions around the time of the unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, increased workload, fatigue, and automation reliance.  Lack of compliance with [[standard operating procedure]]s and [[crew resource management]] were cited as additional factors.<ref name=\"ntsb.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html|title=Crash of Asiana Flight 214 Accident Report Summary |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625051127/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB reached the following final conclusion:\n\n{{quote|The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the flight crew's inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the flight crew's delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances. Contributing to the accident were (1) the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's  pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) the flight crew's nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and (5) flight crew fatigue, which likely degraded their performance.<ref name=\"AAR-14-01 Final Report\"/>{{rp|129}}}}\n\n=== Timeline of the accident ===\n[[File:Asiana Flight 214 Crash NTSB Animation.ogv|thumb|NTSB animation reconstructing the failed descent]]\n[[File:NTSBAsiana214MapFlightOverview.jpg|thumb|Descent flight path]]\nAccording to the NTSB, the weather was fair and the aircraft was cleared for a visual approach.<ref name=\"NYTimesWater\"/><ref name=\"YoutubeNTSB070813\"/>\n\nThe [[instrument landing system]]'s vertical guidance (glide slope) on runway 28L was out of service, as scheduled, beginning on June 1 (and a [[NOTAM|Notice To Airmen]] (NOTAM) to that effect had been issued);<ref>{{cite web|title=KSFO San Francisco Intl |work=PilotWeb |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |quote=06/005 SFO navigation instrument landing system Runway 28L glide path out of service with effect from or effective from 1306011400-1308222359 |url=https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |accessdate=July 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929162007/https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> therefore, a precision [[Instrument approach|ILS approach]] to this runway was not possible.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicated that the plane's approach was too slow and too low.

These primordial black holes would then have more time than any of the above models to accrete, allowing them sufficient time to reach supermassive sizes. Formation of black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and corroborated by observations. The other models for black hole formation listed above are theoretical.\n\nThe difficulty in forming a supermassive black hole resides in the need for enough matter to be in a small enough volume. This matter needs to have very little angular momentum in order for this to happen. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of [[accretion disk]]s. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as [[active galactic nuclei]] or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.\n\n[[File:Artist\u2019s impression of stars born in winds from supermassive black holes.jpg|left|thumb|Artist's impression of stars born in winds from supermassive black holes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stars Born in Winds from Supermassive Black Holes \u2013 ESO's VLT spots brand-new type of star formation|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1710/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref>]]\nA vacancy exists in the observed mass distribution of black holes.

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is now considered to be a galactic core hosting a massive black hole that is accreting matter and displays a sufficiently strong luminosity. The nuclear region of the Milky Way, for example, lacks sufficient luminosity to satisfy this condition. The unified model of AGN is the concept that the large range of observed properties of the AGN taxonomy can be explained using just a small number of physical parameters. For the initial model, these values consisted of the angle of the accretion disk's torus to the line of sight and the luminosity of the source. AGN can be divided into two main groups: a radiative mode AGN in which most of the output is in the form of electromagnetic radiation through an optically thick accretion disk, and a jet mode in which relativistic jets emerge perpendicular to the disk.<ref name=Netzer2015>{{cite journal | title=Revisiting the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei | last1=Netzer | first1=Hagai | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=53 | pages=365\u2013408 | date=August 2015 | doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-082214-122302 | bibcode=2015ARA&A..53..365N | arxiv=1505.00811 }}</ref>\n\nAn empirical correlation between the size of supermassive black holes and the stellar [[velocity dispersion]] <math>\\sigma</math> of a galaxy [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]]<ref name=\"gnuk09\">{{cite journal |author=Gultekin K |display-authors=etal |date=2009 |bibcode=2009ApJ...698..198G |title=The M<math>-\\sigma</math> and M-L Relations in Galactic Bulges, and Determinations of Their Intrinsic Scatter |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=698 |issue=1 |pages=198\u2013221 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/698/1/198|arxiv = 0903.4897 }}</ref> is called the [[M-sigma relation]].\n\n==Evidence==\n\n=== Doppler measurements ===\n[[File:ionringBlackhole.jpeg|thumb|Simulation of a side view of black hole with transparent toroidal ring of ionised matter according to a proposed model<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> for [[Sgr A*]].

For matter very close to a black hole the orbital speed must be comparable with the speed of light, so receding matter will appear very faint compared with advancing matter, which means that systems with intrinsically symmetric discs and rings will acquire a highly asymmetric visual appearance. This effect has been allowed for in modern computer generated images such as the example presented here, based on a plausible model<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">O. Straub, F.H.

Direct Doppler measures of water [[Astrophysical maser|masers]] surrounding the [[Active galactic nucleus|nuclei]] of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian motion]], only possible with a high concentration of matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of [[reverberation mapping]] uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.\n\n=== In the Milky Way ===\n[[File:Galactic centre orbits.svg|thumb|Inferred orbits of 6 stars around supermassive black hole candidate Sagittarius A* at the Milky Way galactic center<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eisenhauer | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | title = SINFONI in the Galactic Center: Young Stars and Infrared Flares in the Central Light-Month | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 628 | issue = 1   | pages = 246\u2013259 | doi=10.1086/430667|arxiv = astro-ph/0502129 |bibcode = 2005ApJ...628..246E }}</ref>]]\n\nAstronomers are confident that the [[Milky Way]] galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 [[light-year]]s from the [[Solar System]], in a region called [[Sagittarius A*]]<ref name=\"Henderson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/article1967154.ece|title=Astronomers confirm black hole at the heart of the Milky Way|last=Henderson|first=Mark|date=December 9, 2008 |publisher= Times Online|accessdate=May 17, 2009|location=London}}</ref> because:\n* The star [[S2 (star)|S2]] follows an [[Kepler orbit|elliptical orbit]] with a [[orbital period|period]] of 15.2 years and a [[pericenter]] (closest distance) of 17 [[light hour|light-hours]] ({{val|1.8|e=13|u=m}} or 120 AU) from the center of the central object.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Sch\u00f6del |display-authors=etal  |date=October 17, 2002 |title=A star in a 15.2-year orbit around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way |journal=Nature |volume=419 |issue=  6908|pages=694\u2013696 | doi= 10.1038/nature01121 |arxiv=astro-ph/0210426 |pmid=12384690|bibcode = 2002Natur.419..694S }}\n</ref>\n* From the motion of star S2, the object's mass can be estimated as {{solar mass|4.1 million}},<ref name=\"Ghez08\">{{cite journal\n | author = Ghez, A.

The discovery is quite surprising, since the black hole is five times more massive than the Milky Way's black hole despite the galaxy being less than five-thousandths the mass of the Milky Way.\n\nSome galaxies, however, lack any supermassive black holes in their centers.

Astrophysicists agree that once a black hole is in place in the center of a galaxy, it can grow by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of matter and by merging with other black holes. There are, however, several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors, or \"seeds\", of supermassive black holes.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the seeds are black holes of tens or perhaps hundreds of solar masses that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter. Another model hypothesizes that before the first stars, large gas clouds could collapse into a \"[[quasi-star]]\", which would in turn collapse into a black hole of around {{Solar mass|20}}.<ref name=\"formation\" /> These stars may have also been formed by [[dark matter halo]]s drawing in enormous amounts of gas by gravity, which would then produce supermassive stars with tens of thousands of solar masses.<ref name=\"zeroing in\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zeroing-in-on-how-supermassive-black-holes-formed1/|title=Zeroing In on How Supermassive Black Holes Formed|author=Yasemin Saplakoglu|publisher=Scientific American|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"cooking up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/11/cooking-up-supermassive-black-holes|title=Cooking up supermassive black holes in the early universe|author=Mara Johnson-Goh|publisher=Astronomy|date=November 20, 2017|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> The \"quasi-star\" becomes unstable to radial perturbations because of electron-positron pair production in its core and could collapse directly into a black hole without a [[supernova]] explosion (which would eject most of its mass, preventing the black hole from growing as fast).

These primordial black holes would then have more time than any of the above models to accrete, allowing them sufficient time to reach supermassive sizes. Formation of black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and corroborated by observations. The other models for black hole formation listed above are theoretical.\n\nThe difficulty in forming a supermassive black hole resides in the need for enough matter to be in a small enough volume. This matter needs to have very little angular momentum in order for this to happen. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of [[accretion disk]]s. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as [[active galactic nuclei]] or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.\n\n[[File:Artist\u2019s impression of stars born in winds from supermassive black holes.jpg|left|thumb|Artist's impression of stars born in winds from supermassive black holes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stars Born in Winds from Supermassive Black Holes \u2013 ESO's VLT spots brand-new type of star formation|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1710/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref>]]\nA vacancy exists in the observed mass distribution of black holes.

The nuclear region of the Milky Way, for example, lacks sufficient luminosity to satisfy this condition. The unified model of AGN is the concept that the large range of observed properties of the AGN taxonomy can be explained using just a small number of physical parameters. For the initial model, these values consisted of the angle of the accretion disk's torus to the line of sight and the luminosity of the source. AGN can be divided into two main groups: a radiative mode AGN in which most of the output is in the form of electromagnetic radiation through an optically thick accretion disk, and a jet mode in which relativistic jets emerge perpendicular to the disk.<ref name=Netzer2015>{{cite journal | title=Revisiting the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei | last1=Netzer | first1=Hagai | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=53 | pages=365\u2013408 | date=August 2015 | doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-082214-122302 | bibcode=2015ARA&A..53..365N | arxiv=1505.00811 }}</ref>\n\nAn empirical correlation between the size of supermassive black holes and the stellar [[velocity dispersion]] <math>\\sigma</math> of a galaxy [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]]<ref name=\"gnuk09\">{{cite journal |author=Gultekin K |display-authors=etal |date=2009 |bibcode=2009ApJ...698..198G |title=The M<math>-\\sigma</math> and M-L Relations in Galactic Bulges, and Determinations of Their Intrinsic Scatter |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=698 |issue=1 |pages=198\u2013221 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/698/1/198|arxiv = 0903.4897 }}</ref> is called the [[M-sigma relation]].\n\n==Evidence==\n\n=== Doppler measurements ===\n[[File:ionringBlackhole.jpeg|thumb|Simulation of a side view of black hole with transparent toroidal ring of ionised matter according to a proposed model<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> for [[Sgr A*]].

For matter very close to a black hole the orbital speed must be comparable with the speed of light, so receding matter will appear very faint compared with advancing matter, which means that systems with intrinsically symmetric discs and rings will acquire a highly asymmetric visual appearance. This effect has been allowed for in modern computer generated images such as the example presented here, based on a plausible model<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">O. Straub, F.H.

For [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon.

The discovery is quite surprising, since the black hole is five times more massive than the Milky Way's black hole despite the galaxy being less than five-thousandths the mass of the Milky Way.\n\nSome galaxies, however, lack any supermassive black holes in their centers. Although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small, dwarf galaxies, one discovery remains mysterious: The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy [[A2261-BCG]] has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole, despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; ten times the size and one thousand times the mass of the Milky Way. Since a supermassive black hole will only be visible while it is accreting, a supermassive black hole can be nearly invisible, except in its effects on stellar orbits.\n\nIn December 2017, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant quasar currently known, [[ULAS J1342+0928]], containing the most distant supermassive black hole, at a reported [[redshift]] of z = 7.54, surpassing the redshift of 7 for the previously known most distant quasar [[ULAS J1120+0641]].<ref name=\"NAT-20171206\">{{cite journal |author=Ba\u00f1ados, Eduardo |display-authors=etal |title=An 800-million-solar-mass black hole in a significantly neutral Universe at a redshift of 7.5 |date=December 6, 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=553 |issue=7689 |pages=473\u2013476 |doi=10.1038/nature25180 |pmid=29211709 |arxiv=1712.01860 |bibcode=2018Natur.553..473B }}</ref><ref name=\"NASA-20171206\">{{cite web |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Ba\u00f1ados |first2=Eduardo |title=Found: Most Distant Black Hole |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7017 |date=December 6, 2017 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=December 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"SPC-20171206\">{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Oldest Monster Black Hole Ever Found Is 800 Million Times More Massive Than the Sun |url=https://www.space.com/39000-oldest-farthest-monster-black-hole-yet.html |date=December 6, 2017 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 6, 2017 }}</ref>\n[[File:BlackHoleDiskFlareInGalaxyOJ287-animation-20200428.webm|thumb|center|400px|Black Hole Disk Flare In Galaxy OJ 287 (animation; 28 April 2020)]]\n\n==Hawking radiation ==\n{{main|Hawking radiation}}\nHawking radiation is [[black-body radiation]] that is predicted to be released by [[black hole]]s, due to quantum effects near the [[event horizon]].
