The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> (181.4), Br<sup>\u2212</sup> (4.2), SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup> (0.4), HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> (0.2), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (14.1), Na<sup>+</sup> (32.5), K<sup>+</sup> (6.2) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg.<ref>I. Steinhorn, ''In Situ Salt Precipitation at the Dead Sea'', Limnol. Oceanogr. 28(3),1983, 580-583</ref> These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was [[calcium chloride]] (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) 14.4%, [[potassium chloride]] (KCl) 4.4%, [[magnesium chloride]] (MgCl<sub>2</sub>) 50.8% and [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s is approximately 85% [[sodium chloride]]. The concentration of [[sulfate]] ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>) is very low, and the concentration of [[bromide]] ions (Br<sup>\u2212</sup>) is the highest of all waters on Earth.[[File:Halite Dead Sea Beach Pebbles.JPG|thumb|Beach pebbles made of [[Halite]]; western coast]]\n\nThe salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24&nbsp;kg/l. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural [[buoyancy]].

The Dead Sea temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] found the Dead Sea to be teeming with a type of [[alga]] called ''[[Dunaliella]]''. ''Dunaliella'' in turn nourished [[carotenoid]]-containing (red-[[pigment]]ed) [[halobacteria]], whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the Dead Sea basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.\n\nIn 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter the Dead Sea.

Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket.

The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> (181.4), Br<sup>\u2212</sup> (4.2), SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup> (0.4), HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> (0.2), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (14.1), Na<sup>+</sup> (32.5), K<sup>+</sup> (6.2) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg.<ref>I. Steinhorn, ''In Situ Salt Precipitation at the Dead Sea'', Limnol.

In comparison, the salt in the water of most [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s is approximately 85% [[sodium chloride]]. The concentration of [[sulfate]] ions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>) is very low, and the concentration of [[bromide]] ions (Br<sup>\u2212</sup>) is the highest of all waters on Earth.[[File:Halite Dead Sea Beach Pebbles.JPG|thumb|Beach pebbles made of [[Halite]]; western coast]]\n\nThe salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%.

The Dead Sea temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] found the Dead Sea to be teeming with a type of [[alga]] called ''[[Dunaliella]]''. ''Dunaliella'' in turn nourished [[carotenoid]]-containing (red-[[pigment]]ed) [[halobacteria]], whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the Dead Sea basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.\n\nIn 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter the Dead Sea.

The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry.

There was general doubt at the time that smooth wheels could obtain traction on smooth rails. This resulted in proposals using rack or other drive mechanisms.\n\n[[File:Blenkinsop's rack locomotive, 1812 (British Railway Locomotives 1803-1853).jpg|thumb|left|The ''Salamanca'' locomotive]]\nMr Blenkinsop of Middleton Colliery patented the use of cogged wheels in 1811 and in 1812, the [[Middleton Railway]] (edgeway, rack rail) successfully used twin cylinder steam locomotives made by [[Matthew Murray]] of [[Holbeck]], [[Leeds]]. [[George Stephenson]] made his first steam locomotive in 1813 (patented 1815) for the [[Killingworth]] colliery,<ref name=\"PMEM1844\"/> and found smooth wheels on smooth rails provided adequate grip. Although he later recounted that they called this locomotive 'My Lord' as it was financed by [[Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth|Lord Ravensworth]], it seems that it was known at the time as [[Killingworth locomotives#Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]. In 1814 William Stewart was engaged by Parkend Coal Co in the [[Forest of Dean]] for the construction of a steam locomotive, which when trialled was reported to be successful.<ref name=\"PMEM1844\"/> Stewart did not receive his expected reward and the two parties parted on bad terms. Stewart was 'obliged to abandon the engine to that Company'.<ref>\"Inventors and Capitalists\", William Stewart, The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, October 1844, p24</ref> In 1821, a wagonway was proposed to connect the mines at [[Durham, England|West Durham]], [[Darlington]] and the [[River Tees]] at [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], [[George Stephenson]] successfully argued that horse-drawn wagonways were obsolete and a steam-powered railway could carry 50 times as much coal. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 1825 he built the locomotive ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in England's northeast, which became the world's first public steam railway in 1825, via both horse power and steam power on different runs.\n\nStationary steam engines for mining were generally available around the middle of the 18th century.{{fact|date=May 2019}} Wagonways and steam-powered railways had steep uphill sections and would employ a cable powered by a stationary steam engine to work the inclined sections. British troops in Lewiston, New York used a cable wagonway to move supplies to bases before the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Stockton and Darlington had two inclined sections powered by cable. The transition from a wagonway to a fully steam-powered railway was gradual. Railways up to the 1830s that were steam-powered often made runs with horses when the steam locomotives were unavailable. Even in the steam age, it was convenient to use horses in station yards to [[Shunting (rail)|shunt]] wagons from one place to another. Horses do not need lengthy times to raise steam in the boiler, and can take shortcuts from one siding to another. At [[Hamley Bridge]] tenders were called for the supply of horses, in part because normal railway staff lacked horse handling skills.\n\n== Pole road ==\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Pole road]] -->\n[[File:\"Perdido\", a pole road locomotive.jpg|thumb|''Perdido'', a steam pole road locomotive]]\nWooden rails continued to be used for temporary railroads into the twentieth century. Some timber harvesting companies in the southeastern [[United States]] created pole roads using unmarketable logs, which were effectively free, to create tracks at a cost of between $100 and $500 per mile. Permanence was not an issue, as the [[lumberjack]]s moved on to other stands of [[Tree|timber]] as each area was cleared.<ref name=\"Trains_1948\">\"Pole Road Locomotives of the Early Days,\" ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine, February 1948</ref> At least one such pole road system reportedly extended some {{convert|20|mi|km}}.<ref>[http://www.escohis.org/atmore_alabama] {{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nTypically the pole rails were [[Trunk (botany)|logs]] of {{convert|8 to 12|in|cm}} diameter, laid parallel directly on the ground without [[railroad tie|cross-ties]], and joined end-to-end with [[lap joint]]s and [[wood]]en [[wikt:peg|peg]]s. [[Rolling stock]] typically had wheels either with concave rims that hugged the top of the pole rails, or un-flanged wheels with separate guide wheels running against the side of each rail. Steam [[traction engine]]s and some purpose-built locomotives were successfully used for hauling trains of logs. For example, \u2018\u2019Perdido\u2019\u2019 was built by [[Adams & Price Locomotive and Machinery Works]] of [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1885 for the [[Wallace, Sanford and Company]] sawmill at [[Atmore, Alabama|Williams Station, Alabama]], where it hauled up to seven cars of 3 or 4 logs each. This was a geared engine (4.5 to 1 [[gear train|gear ratio]]), driving four individually-rotating concave-rim wheels on stationary axles via chain drives; powerful but running less than {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=\"Trains_1948\"/> Still later, modified [[semi-trailer truck|semitrailer tractors]] have been used.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ScI_Gve0w</ref>\n\n==Decline==\n\nAs steam power gradually replaced horse power, the term \"wagonway\" became obsolete and was superseded by the term \"railway\". In 2018, very few horse or cable freight railways are operating, notable examples being the cable-hauled [[St Michael's Mount Tramway]] and the [[Reisszug]], which has been in continuous operation since around 1500. A few passenger lines continue to operate, including the horse-hauled [[Douglas Bay Horse Tramway]] and the cable-hauled [[San Francisco cable cars]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trains}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Barlow rail]]\n* [[Granite Railway]]\n* [[Holy Island Waggonway]]\n* [[Horsecar]]\n* [[Mine railway]]\n* [[Rail profile]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last1=Smiles|first1=Samuel|last2=Stephenson|first2=George|title=The life of George Stephenson, Railway Engineer |url=http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/the_life_of_george_stephenson_railway_engineer-1858.pdf|year=1857|location=London|oclc=162233825}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Westwood|first1=John Norton|title=The Pictorial History of Railways|year=1988|publisher=Bison Books|location=London|isbn=0-86124-446-X|oclc=34774624|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pictorialhistory0000west}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110613005054/http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=1747 Description and photographs of the archaeological excavation of a wooden waggonway on the site of Lambton [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] Works in [[North East England]].]\n* [https://archive.is/20130804150108/http://www.llanellich.org.uk/Files/st-davids-railway.html The two and a half mile long Dafen (Llanelli) railway opened in 1833.]\n\n\n[[Category:History of rail transport]]\n[[Category:Horse-drawn railways]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Tramway (industrial)|Minecart|Horsecar}}\n[[File:Wagonway.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Outram]]'s [[Little Eaton Gangway]] in July 1908 with the last train of loaded coal wagons arriving.]]\n'''Wagonways''' (or '''Waggonways''') consisted of the horses, equipment and tracks used for hauling wagons, which preceded [[Steam railroad|steam-powered railways]].

They were supported on sleepers by chairs at intervals of {{convert|3|ft|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on|round=5}}, and were fish-bellied between the support points. As used by [[George Stephenson]] on the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway|Stockton & Darlington]], and [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway|Canterbury & Whitstable]] lines, they weighed {{convert|28|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EB1911/> On the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] they were usually {{convert|12|or|15|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{convert|35|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}} and were fastened by iron wedges to chairs weighing {{convert|15|or|17|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} each.

The fish-bellied rails were found to break near the chairs and starting in 1834, they were gradually replaced with [[Rail profile#Vignoles rail|parallel rails]] weighing {{convert|50|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Steam power ==\n[[File:TrevithicksEngine.jpg|thumb|A replica of Trevithick's engine at the [[National Waterfront Museum]], Swansea]]\n\nIn 1804, [[Richard Trevithick]], in the first recorded use of steam power on a railway, ran a high-pressure [[steam locomotive]] with smooth wheels on an 'L' section plateway near [[Merthyr Tydfil]], but it was more expensive than horses.<ref name=EB1911/> He made three trips from the iron mines at Penydarren to the Merthyr-Cardiff Canal and each time broke the rails that were designed for horse wagon loads. There was general doubt at the time that smooth wheels could obtain traction on smooth rails. This resulted in proposals using rack or other drive mechanisms.\n\n[[File:Blenkinsop's rack locomotive, 1812 (British Railway Locomotives 1803-1853).jpg|thumb|left|The ''Salamanca'' locomotive]]\nMr Blenkinsop of Middleton Colliery patented the use of cogged wheels in 1811 and in 1812, the [[Middleton Railway]] (edgeway, rack rail) successfully used twin cylinder steam locomotives made by [[Matthew Murray]] of [[Holbeck]], [[Leeds]]. [[George Stephenson]] made his first steam locomotive in 1813 (patented 1815) for the [[Killingworth]] colliery,<ref name=\"PMEM1844\"/> and found smooth wheels on smooth rails provided adequate grip. Although he later recounted that they called this locomotive 'My Lord' as it was financed by [[Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth|Lord Ravensworth]], it seems that it was known at the time as [[Killingworth locomotives#Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]. In 1814 William Stewart was engaged by Parkend Coal Co in the [[Forest of Dean]] for the construction of a steam locomotive, which when trialled was reported to be successful.<ref name=\"PMEM1844\"/> Stewart did not receive his expected reward and the two parties parted on bad terms. Stewart was 'obliged to abandon the engine to that Company'.<ref>\"Inventors and Capitalists\", William Stewart, The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, October 1844, p24</ref> In 1821, a wagonway was proposed to connect the mines at [[Durham, England|West Durham]], [[Darlington]] and the [[River Tees]] at [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], [[George Stephenson]] successfully argued that horse-drawn wagonways were obsolete and a steam-powered railway could carry 50 times as much coal. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 1825 he built the locomotive ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in England's northeast, which became the world's first public steam railway in 1825, via both horse power and steam power on different runs.\n\nStationary steam engines for mining were generally available around the middle of the 18th century.{{fact|date=May 2019}} Wagonways and steam-powered railways had steep uphill sections and would employ a cable powered by a stationary steam engine to work the inclined sections. British troops in Lewiston, New York used a cable wagonway to move supplies to bases before the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Stockton and Darlington had two inclined sections powered by cable. The transition from a wagonway to a fully steam-powered railway was gradual. Railways up to the 1830s that were steam-powered often made runs with horses when the steam locomotives were unavailable. Even in the steam age, it was convenient to use horses in station yards to [[Shunting (rail)|shunt]] wagons from one place to another. Horses do not need lengthy times to raise steam in the boiler, and can take shortcuts from one siding to another. At [[Hamley Bridge]] tenders were called for the supply of horses, in part because normal railway staff lacked horse handling skills.\n\n== Pole road ==\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Pole road]] -->\n[[File:\"Perdido\", a pole road locomotive.jpg|thumb|''Perdido'', a steam pole road locomotive]]\nWooden rails continued to be used for temporary railroads into the twentieth century. Some timber harvesting companies in the southeastern [[United States]] created pole roads using unmarketable logs, which were effectively free, to create tracks at a cost of between $100 and $500 per mile. Permanence was not an issue, as the [[lumberjack]]s moved on to other stands of [[Tree|timber]] as each area was cleared.<ref name=\"Trains_1948\">\"Pole Road Locomotives of the Early Days,\" ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine, February 1948</ref> At least one such pole road system reportedly extended some {{convert|20|mi|km}}.<ref>[http://www.escohis.org/atmore_alabama] {{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nTypically the pole rails were [[Trunk (botany)|logs]] of {{convert|8 to 12|in|cm}} diameter, laid parallel directly on the ground without [[railroad tie|cross-ties]], and joined end-to-end with [[lap joint]]s and [[wood]]en [[wikt:peg|peg]]s. [[Rolling stock]] typically had wheels either with concave rims that hugged the top of the pole rails, or un-flanged wheels with separate guide wheels running against the side of each rail. Steam [[traction engine]]s and some purpose-built locomotives were successfully used for hauling trains of logs. For example, \u2018\u2019Perdido\u2019\u2019 was built by [[Adams & Price Locomotive and Machinery Works]] of [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1885 for the [[Wallace, Sanford and Company]] sawmill at [[Atmore, Alabama|Williams Station, Alabama]], where it hauled up to seven cars of 3 or 4 logs each. This was a geared engine (4.5 to 1 [[gear train|gear ratio]]), driving four individually-rotating concave-rim wheels on stationary axles via chain drives; powerful but running less than {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=\"Trains_1948\"/> Still later, modified [[semi-trailer truck|semitrailer tractors]] have been used.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ScI_Gve0w</ref>\n\n==Decline==\n\nAs steam power gradually replaced horse power, the term \"wagonway\" became obsolete and was superseded by the term \"railway\". In 2018, very few horse or cable freight railways are operating, notable examples being the cable-hauled [[St Michael's Mount Tramway]] and the [[Reisszug]], which has been in continuous operation since around 1500. A few passenger lines continue to operate, including the horse-hauled [[Douglas Bay Horse Tramway]] and the cable-hauled [[San Francisco cable cars]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trains}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Barlow rail]]\n* [[Granite Railway]]\n* [[Holy Island Waggonway]]\n* [[Horsecar]]\n* [[Mine railway]]\n* [[Rail profile]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last1=Smiles|first1=Samuel|last2=Stephenson|first2=George|title=The life of George Stephenson, Railway Engineer |url=http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/the_life_of_george_stephenson_railway_engineer-1858.pdf|year=1857|location=London|oclc=162233825}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Westwood|first1=John Norton|title=The Pictorial History of Railways|year=1988|publisher=Bison Books|location=London|isbn=0-86124-446-X|oclc=34774624|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pictorialhistory0000west}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110613005054/http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=1747 Description and photographs of the archaeological excavation of a wooden waggonway on the site of Lambton [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] Works in [[North East England]].]\n* [https://archive.is/20130804150108/http://www.llanellich.org.uk/Files/st-davids-railway.html The two and a half mile long Dafen (Llanelli) railway opened in 1833.]\n\n\n[[Category:History of rail transport]]\n[[Category:Horse-drawn railways]]\n", "name_user": "Slambo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:better links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagonway"}

The population was 1,931,000 in the 2010 census and the largest town is [[Maumere]]. The name ''Flores'' is derived from the  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"flowers\".\n\nFlores is located east of [[Sumbawa]] and [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] islands and west of [[Lembata]] island and the [[Alor Archipelago]]. To the southeast is [[Timor]]. To the south, across the Sumba Strait, is [[Sumba]] island and to the north, beyond the [[Flores Sea]], is [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAmong all islands containing Indonesian territory, Flores is the 10th most populous after [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]] ([[Kalimantan]]), [[Sulawesi]], [[New Guinea]], [[Bali]], [[Madura]], [[Lombok]], and [[Timor]] and also the [[List of islands by area|10th biggest island of Indonesia]].\n\nUntil the arrival of modern humans, Flores was inhabited by [[Homo floresiensis|''Homo floresiensis'']], a [[Pygmy_peoples|pygmy]] [[archaic human]].\n\n==Etymology==\nUnlike most islands in the Indonesian archipelago, the name ''Flores'' was given by the Portuguese, from ''Cabo de Flores'' (Cape of Flowers), the Portuguese term for the eastern part of the island.

Their influence is still discernible in Sikka's language, culture and religion. The first Portuguese visit took place in 1511, through the expedition of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]] and his vice-captain [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]], en route through the Sunda islands.\n\nThe [[Dominican order]] was extremely important in this island, as well as in the neighbouring islands of [[Timor]] and [[Solor]]. When in 1613 the Dutch attacked the Fortress of Solor, the population of this fort, led by the Dominicans, moved to the harbor town of [[Larantuka]], on the eastern coast of Flores. This population was mixed, of Portuguese and local islanders descent and Larantuqueiros, [[Topasses]] or, as Dutch knew them, the 'Black Portuguese' (Zwarte Portuguezen).\n\nThe Larantuqueiros or Topasses became the dominant sandalwood trading people of the region for the next 200 years. This group used Portuguese as the language for worship, Malay as the language of trade and a mixed dialect as mother tongue. This was observed by [[William Dampier]], an English privateer visiting the Island in 1699:\n\n{{quote|These [the Topasses] have no Forts, but depend on their Alliance with the Natives: And indeed they are already so mixt, that it is hard to distinguish whether they are Portuguese or Indians.

In 1851 Lima Lopes, the new governor of Timor, Solor and Flores, agreed to sell eastern Flores and the nearby islands to the Dutch in return for a payment of 200,000 [[Dutch guilder|Florins]] in order to support his impoverished administration. Lima Lopes did so without the consent of Lisbon and was dismissed in disgrace, but his agreement was not rescinded and in 1854 Portugal ceded all its historical claims on Flores.

In the centre of the island in the districts of [[Ngada]], [[Nagekeo]], and [[Ende Regency|Ende]] there is what is variously called the [[Central Flores languages|Central Flores dialect chain or linkage]]. Within this area there are slight [[linguistics|linguistic]] differences in almost every village. At least six separate languages are identifiable. These are from west to east: [[Ngadha]], [[Nage]], [[Keo language|Keo]], [[Ende language (Indonesia)|Ende]], [[Lio language|Lio]] and [[Palu'e language|Palu'e]], which is spoken on the island with the same name of the north coast of Flores. Locals would probably also add [[So'a]] and [[Bajawa]] to this list, which anthropologists have labeled dialects of Ngadha. To the east, [[Sika language|Sika]] and [[Lamaholot language|Lamaholot]] can be found.\n\n[[File:Jesus Statue Maumere.jpg|thumb|Jesus Statue in [[Maumere]]]]\nThe native peoples of Flores are mostly [[Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity|Christians]], whereas most other Indonesians are [[Islam|Muslim]]. As a consequence, Flores may be regarded as surrounded by a [[geography of religion|religious border]]. The prominence of Catholicism on the island results from its [[the Portuguese in Indonesia|colonisation by Portugal]] in the east and early 20th-century support by the Dutch in the west. In other parts of Indonesia with significant Christian populations, such as the [[Maluku Islands]] and [[Sulawesi]], the geographical divide is less rigid and Muslims and Christians sometimes live side by side. Flores thereby also has less [[Religion in Indonesia#Summary|religious violence]] that has sporadically occurred in other parts of Indonesia. There are several churches on the island. On 26 May 2019, Flores' St. Paul Catholic University of Indonesia was formally inaugurated by Indonesian Education Minister Mohamad Nasir, becoming the first Catholic University in Flores.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dagur |first=Ryan |url=https://international.la-croix.com/news/indonesia-inaugurates-first-catholic-university-in-flores/10201 |title=Indonesia inaugurates first Catholic university in Flores |date=28 May 2019 |work=La Croix International}}</ref> Aside from Catholicism, Islam also has a presence on the island especially in some coastal communities.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:BenaVillage.jpg|thumb|Bena Village]]\n[[File:LabuhanBajoHarbour.JPG|thumb|Harbour of Labuhan Bajo on the west coast]]\nThe most famous tourist attraction in Flores is the {{convert|1639|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Kelimutu]] volcano which containing three colored lakes, located in the district of Ende close to the town of [[Moni]], although there is also the [[Inierie]] volcano near [[Bajawa]].

However, due to the destructive practice of local fishermen using bombs to fish, and locals selling shells to tourists, combined with the after effects of a devastating tsunami in 1992, the reefs have slowly been destroyed.\n\n[[Labuan Bajo]], located on the western tip is often used by tourists as a base to visit [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] and [[Rinca]] islands. Labuan Bajo also attracts scuba divers, as [[whale sharks]] inhabit the waters around Labuan bajo.\n\nThe Luba and Bena villages include traditional houses in Flores. Bena is also noted for its Stone Age [[megalith]]s.\n\n[[Larantuka]], on the isle's eastern end, is known for its [[Holy Week]] festivals.\n\nIn recent years, local tourist firms around [[Kelimutu]] have begun promoting cycling tours around Flores, some of which take up to five or six days depending on the particular program.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Makur |first=Markus  |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/13/bicycle-tours-kelimutu-boost-local-economy.html |title=Bicycle tours of Kelimutu boost local economy |date=13 March 2016 |work=The Jakarta Post}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nIn addition to tourism, the main economic activities on Flores are agriculture, fishing and seaweed production.

The population was 1,931,000 in the 2010 census and the largest town is [[Maumere]]. The name ''Flores'' is derived from the  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"flowers\".\n\nFlores is located east of [[Sumbawa]] and [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] islands and west of [[Lembata]] island and the [[Alor Archipelago]]. To the southeast is [[Timor]]. To the south, across the Sumba Strait, is [[Sumba]] island and to the north, beyond the [[Flores Sea]], is [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAmong all islands containing Indonesian territory, Flores is the 10th most populous after [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]] ([[Kalimantan]]), [[Sulawesi]], [[New Guinea]], [[Bali]], [[Madura]], [[Lombok]], and [[Timor]] and also the [[List of islands by area|10th biggest island of Indonesia]].\n\nUntil the arrival of modern humans, Flores was inhabited by [[Homo floresiensis]], a [[Pygmy_peoples|pygmy]] [[archaic human]].\n\n==Etymology==\nUnlike most islands in the Indonesian archipelago, the name ''Flores'' was given by the Portuguese, from ''Cabo de Flores'' (Cape of Flowers), the Portuguese term for the eastern part of the island. This part of the island, originally called Kopondai, was so named by the Portuguese because of the flowering ''[[Delonix regia]]'' trees found there.<ref>Flores, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> The original name of Flores was ''Nipa'', referring to the serpent.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Homo floresiensis''===\n[[File:Dermoplastie de la Femme de Flor\u00e8s par Elisabeth Dayn\u00e8s, 2007.jpg|thumb|Model representing a female ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'']]\n{{Main|Homo floresiensis}}\nBefore the arrival of modern humans, Flores was occupied by [[Homo floresiensis]], a [[Pygmy_peoples|pygmy]] [[archaic human]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Baab |first=Karen L. |last2=McNulty |first2=Kieran P. |last3=Harvati |first3=Katerina |displayauthors=3 |date=2013 |title=Homo floresiensis Contextualized: A Geometric Morphometric Comparative Analysis of Fossil and Pathological Human Samples |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=e69119 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...869119B |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0069119 |pmc=3707875 |pmid=23874886}}</ref> Remains of nine individuals have been found,<ref name=\"Brown_et_al_2004\">{{cite journal| author=Brown, P.|display-authors=etal<!--- | coauthors=Sutikna, T., Morwood, M.

Their influence is still discernible in Sikka's language, culture and religion. The first Portuguese visit took place in 1511, through the expedition of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]] and his vice-captain [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]], en route through the Sunda islands.\n\nThe [[Dominican order]] was extremely important in this island, as well as in the neighbouring islands of [[Timor]] and [[Solor]]. When in 1613 the Dutch attacked the Fortress of Solor, the population of this fort, led by the Dominicans, moved to the harbor town of [[Larantuka]], on the eastern coast of Flores. This population was mixed, of Portuguese and local islanders descent and Larantuqueiros, [[Topasses]] or, as Dutch knew them, the 'Black Portuguese' (Zwarte Portuguezen).\n\nThe Larantuqueiros or Topasses became the dominant sandalwood trading people of the region for the next 200 years. This group used Portuguese as the language for worship, Malay as the language of trade and a mixed dialect as mother tongue. This was observed by [[William Dampier]], an English privateer visiting the Island in 1699:\n\n{{quote|These [the Topasses] have no Forts, but depend on their Alliance with the Natives: And indeed they are already so mixt, that it is hard to distinguish whether they are Portuguese or Indians.

In 1851 Lima Lopes, the new governor of Timor, Solor and Flores, agreed to sell eastern Flores and the nearby islands to the Dutch in return for a payment of 200,000 [[Dutch guilder|Florins]] in order to support his impoverished administration. Lima Lopes did so without the consent of Lisbon and was dismissed in disgrace, but his agreement was not rescinded and in 1854 Portugal ceded all its historical claims on Flores.

To the east, [[Sika language|Sika]] and [[Lamaholot language|Lamaholot]] can be found.\n\n[[File:Jesus Statue Maumere.jpg|thumb|Jesus Statue in [[Maumere]]]]\nThe native peoples of Flores are mostly [[Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity|Christians]], whereas most other Indonesians are [[Islam|Muslim]]. As a consequence, Flores may be regarded as surrounded by a [[geography of religion|religious border]]. The prominence of Catholicism on the island results from its [[the Portuguese in Indonesia|colonisation by Portugal]] in the east and early 20th-century support by the Dutch in the west. In other parts of Indonesia with significant Christian populations, such as the [[Maluku Islands]] and [[Sulawesi]], the geographical divide is less rigid and Muslims and Christians sometimes live side by side. Flores thereby also has less [[Religion in Indonesia#Summary|religious violence]] that has sporadically occurred in other parts of Indonesia. There are several churches on the island. On 26 May 2019, Flores' St. Paul Catholic University of Indonesia was formally inaugurated by Indonesian Education Minister Mohamad Nasir, becoming the first Catholic University in Flores.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dagur |first=Ryan |url=https://international.la-croix.com/news/indonesia-inaugurates-first-catholic-university-in-flores/10201 |title=Indonesia inaugurates first Catholic university in Flores |date=28 May 2019 |work=La Croix International}}</ref> Aside from Catholicism, Islam also has a presence on the island especially in some coastal communities.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:BenaVillage.jpg|thumb|Bena Village]]\n[[File:LabuhanBajoHarbour.JPG|thumb|Harbour of Labuhan Bajo on the west coast]]\nThe most famous tourist attraction in Flores is the {{convert|1639|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Kelimutu]] volcano which containing three colored lakes, located in the district of Ende close to the town of [[Moni]], although there is also the [[Inierie]] volcano near [[Bajawa]]. These [[volcanic crater lake|crater lake]]s are in the caldera of a volcano, and fed by a volcanic gas source, resulting in highly acidic water. The colored lakes change colors on an irregular basis, depending on the oxidation state of the lake<ref>Pasternack.

However, due to the destructive practice of local fishermen using bombs to fish, and locals selling shells to tourists, combined with the after effects of a devastating tsunami in 1992, the reefs have slowly been destroyed.\n\n[[Labuan Bajo]], located on the western tip is often used by tourists as a base to visit [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] and [[Rinca]] islands. Labuan Bajo also attracts scuba divers, as [[whale sharks]] inhabit the waters around Labuan bajo.\n\nThe Luba and Bena villages include traditional houses in Flores. Bena is also noted for its Stone Age [[megalith]]s.\n\n[[Larantuka]], on the isle's eastern end, is known for its [[Holy Week]] festivals.\n\nIn recent years, local tourist firms around [[Kelimutu]] have begun promoting cycling tours around Flores, some of which take up to five or six days depending on the particular program.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Makur |first=Markus  |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/13/bicycle-tours-kelimutu-boost-local-economy.html |title=Bicycle tours of Kelimutu boost local economy |date=13 March 2016 |work=The Jakarta Post}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nIn addition to tourism, the main economic activities on Flores are agriculture, fishing and seaweed production. The primary food crops being grown on Flores are [[rice]], [[maize]], [[sweet potato]] and [[cassava]], while the main cash crops are [[coffee]], [[coconut]], [[candle nut]] and [[cashew]].<ref>[http://www.kadin-indonesia.or.id/en/doc/reg_info/reg_info_EastNusaTenggara.pdf East Nusa Tenggara], Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
