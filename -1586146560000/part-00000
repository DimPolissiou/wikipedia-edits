They are generally produced in the process of [[alpha decay]], but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the [[Greek alphabet]], [[Alpha|\u03b1]]. The symbol for the alpha particle is \u03b1 or \u03b1<sup>2+</sup>. Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also sometimes written as {{chem|He|2+}} or {{chem|4|2|He|2+}} indicating a helium ion with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the [[ion]] gains electrons from its environment, the alpha particle becomes a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom {{chem|4|2|He}}.\n\nAlpha particles, like helium nuclei, have a net spin of zero. Due to the mechanism of their production in standard alpha [[radioactive decay]], alpha particles generally have a kinetic energy of about 5&nbsp;[[MeV]], and a velocity in the vicinity of 5% the [[Speed of light|speed of light]]. (See discussion below for the limits of these figures in alpha decay.) They are a highly [[ionizing radiation|ionizing]] form of [[particle radiation]], and (when resulting from radioactive [[alpha decay]]) have low [[penetration depth]]. They can be stopped by a few centimeters of [[air]], or by the [[skin]]. \n\nHowever, so-called [[long range alpha]] particles from [[ternary fission]] are three times as energetic, and penetrate three times as far. As noted, the helium nuclei that form 10\u201312% of [[cosmic ray]]s are also usually of much higher energy than those produced by nuclear decay processes, and are thus capable of being highly penetrating and able to traverse the human body and also many meters of dense solid shielding, depending on their energy. To a lesser extent, this is also true of very high-energy helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators.\n\nWhen alpha particle emitting [[isotope|isotopes]] are ingested, they are far more dangerous than their half-life or decay rate would suggest, due to the high [[relative biological effectiveness]] of alpha radiation to cause biological damage.

A higher energy version of alphas than produced in alpha decay is a common product of an uncommon [[nuclear fission]] result called [[ternary fission]]. However, helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators ([[cyclotrons]], [[synchrotron]]s, and the like) are less likely to be referred to as \"alpha particles\".\n\n==Sources of alpha particles==\n\n===Alpha decay===\n[[File:Physicist Studying Alpha Rays GPN-2000-000381.jpg|thumb|300px|A physicist observes alpha particles from the decay of a polonium source in a [[cloud chamber]]]][[File:Alpha radiation in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|300px|Alpha radiation detected in an isopropanol [[cloud chamber]] (after injection of an artificial source radon-220).]]\n{{Main|Alpha decay}}\n\nThe best-known source of alpha particles is [[alpha decay]] of heavier (> 106 '''u''' atomic weight) atoms. When an [[atom]] emits an alpha particle in alpha decay, the atom's [[mass number]] decreases by four due to the loss of the four [[nucleon]]s in the alpha particle. The [[atomic number]] of the atom goes down by exactly two, as a result of the loss of two protons&nbsp;\u2013 the atom becomes a new element. Examples of this sort of [[nuclear transmutation]] are when [[uranium]] becomes [[thorium]], or [[radium]] becomes [[radon]] gas, due to alpha decay.\n\nAlpha particles are commonly emitted by all of the larger [[radioactive]] nuclei such as [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[actinium]], and [[radium]], as well as the [[transuranic]] elements. Unlike other types of decay, alpha decay as a process must have a minimum-size atomic nucleus that can support it. The smallest nuclei that have to date been found to be capable of alpha emission are [[beryllium-8]] and the lightest [[nuclides]] of [[tellurium]] (element 52), with mass numbers between 104 and 109. The process of alpha decay sometimes leaves the nucleus in an excited state, wherein the emission of a [[gamma ray]] then removes the excess [[energy]].\n\n====Mechanism of production in alpha decay====\nIn contrast to [[beta decay]], the [[fundamental interaction]]s responsible for alpha decay are a balance between the [[electromagnetic force]] and [[nuclear force]]. Alpha decay results from the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb repulsion]]<ref name=\"Krane\"/> between the alpha particle and the rest of the nucleus, which both have a positive [[electric charge]], but which is kept in check by the [[nuclear force]]. In [[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical physics]], alpha particles do not have enough energy to escape the [[potential well]] from the strong force inside the nucleus (this well involves escaping the strong force to go up one side of the well, which is followed by the electromagnetic force causing a repulsive push-off down the other side).\n\nHowever, the [[quantum tunneling|quantum tunnelling]] effect allows alphas to escape even though they do not have enough energy to overcome the [[nuclear force]]. This is allowed by the wave nature of matter, which allows the alpha particle to spend some of its time in a region so far from the nucleus that the potential from the repulsive electromagnetic force has fully compensated for the attraction of the nuclear force. From this point, alpha particles can escape, and in quantum mechanics, after a certain time, they do so.\n\n===Ternary fission===\nEspecially energetic alpha particles deriving from a nuclear process are produced in the relatively rare (one in a few hundred) [[nuclear fission]] process of [[ternary fission]]. In this process, three charged particles are produced from the event instead of the normal two, with the smallest of the charged particles most probably (90% probability) being an alpha particle. Such alpha particles are termed \"long range alphas\" since at their typical energy of 16 MeV, they are at far higher energy than is ever produced by alpha decay. Ternary fission happens in both neutron-induced fission (the [[nuclear reaction]] that happens in a nuclear reactor), and also when [[fissionable]] and [[fissile]] [[actinide]]s{{g}} nuclides (i.e., heavy atoms capable of fission) undergo [[spontaneous fission]] as a form of radioactive decay. In both induced and spontaneous fission, the higher energies available in heavy nuclei result in long range alphas of higher energy than those from alpha decay.\n\n===Accelerators===\nEnergetic helium nuclei may be produced by [[cyclotron]]s, [[synchrotron]]s, and other [[particle accelerator]]s, but they are not normally referred to as \"alpha particles.\"  {{Clarify|date=November 2019}}<!--What are they referred to as?-->\n\n===Solar core reactions===\nAs noted, helium nuclei may participate in nuclear reactions in stars, and occasionally and historically these have been referred to as alpha reactions (see for example [[triple alpha process]]).\n\n===Cosmic rays===\nIn addition, extremely high energy helium nuclei sometimes referred to as alpha particles make up about 10 to 12% of [[cosmic ray]]s. The mechanisms of cosmic ray production continue to be debated.\n\n==Energy and absorption==\nThe energy of the alpha particle emitted in [[alpha decay]] is mildly dependent on the half-life for the emission process, with many orders of magnitude differences in half-life being associated with energy changes of less than 50%.\n\nThe energy of alpha particles emitted varies, with higher energy alpha particles being emitted from larger nuclei, but most alpha particles have energies of between 3 and 7&nbsp;[[MeV]] (mega-electron-volts), corresponding to extremely long and extremely short half-lives of alpha-emitting nuclides, respectively.\n\nWith a typical kinetic energy of 5&nbsp;MeV; the speed of emitted alpha paarticles is 15,000&nbsp;km/s, which is 5% of the speed of light. This energy is a substantial amount of energy for a single particle, but their high mass means alpha particles have a lower speed than any other common type of radiation, e.g. [[Beta particle|\u03b2 particles]], [[neutron radiation|neutrons]].<ref>N.B. Since gamma rays are [[electromagnetic]] ([[light]]) they move at the speed of light (''c''). Beta particles often move at a large fraction of ''c'', and exceed 60%&nbsp;''c'' whenever their energy is >&nbsp;64&nbsp;keV, which it commonly is. Neutron velocity from nuclear reactions ranges from about 6%&nbsp;''c'' for fission to as much as 17%&nbsp;''c'' for fusion.</ref> \n\nBecause of their charge and large mass, alpha particles are easily absorbed by materials, and they can travel only a few centimetres in air. They can be absorbed by tissue paper or by the outer layers of human skin. They typically penetrate skin about 40&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s, equivalent to a few [[cell (biology)|cells]] deep.\n\n==Biological effects==\n{{main|relative biological effectiveness}}\n\nDue to the short range of absorption and inability to penetrate the outer layers of skin, alpha particles are not, in general, dangerous to life unless the source is ingested or inhaled.<ref name=\"Christensen2014\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Christensen |first=D.

It is the most strongly ionizing, and with large enough doses can cause any or all of the symptoms of [[radiation poisoning]]. It is estimated that [[chromosome]] damage from alpha particles is anywhere from 10 to 1000 times greater than that caused by an equivalent amount of gamma or beta radiation, with the average being set at 20 times. A study of European nuclear workers exposed internally to alpha radiation from plutonium and uranium found that when relative biological effectiveness is considered to be 20, the carcinogenic potential (in terms of lung cancer) of alpha radiation appears to be consistent with that reported for doses of external gamma radiation i.e. a given dose of alpha-particles inhaled presents the same risk as a 20-times higher dose of gamma radiation.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Grellier |first1=James\n |display-authors=etal\n |date=2017\n |title=Risk of lung cancer mortality in nuclear workers from internal exposure to alpha particle-emitting radionuclides\n|journal=Epidemiology\n |volume=28\n |issue=5\n |pages=675\u2013684\n |doi=10.1097/EDE.0000000000000684\n |pmid=28520643\n |pmc=5540354\n}}</ref> The powerful alpha emitter [[polonium-210]] (a milligram of <sup>210</sup>Po emits as many alpha particles per second as 4.215&nbsp;grams of [[Radium-226|<sup>226</sup>Ra]]) is suspected of playing a role in [[lung cancer]] and [[bladder cancer]] related to [[Tobacco and health#Radioactive components of tobacco|tobacco smoking]].<ref name=\"Science v143 no3603\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Radford |first=Edward P.\n |last2=Hunt |first2=Vilma R.\n |year=1964\n |title=Polonium-210: A Volatile Radioelement in Cigarettes\n |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]\n |volume=143\n |issue=3603\n |pages=247\u2013249\n |bibcode=1964Sci...143..247R\n |doi=10.1126/science.143.3603.247\n |pmid=14078362\n}}</ref> <sup>210</sup>Po was used to kill Russian dissident and ex-[[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] officer [[Alexander Litvinenko|Alexander V.

Rutherford and T. Royds (1908) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hYTyA7h4FAsC&pg=PA313#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Spectrum of the radium emanation,\"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', Series 6, vol. 16, pages 313\u2013317.</ref> To do this they allowed alpha particles to penetrate a very thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, thus capturing a large number of the hypothesized helium ions inside the tube. They then caused an [[electric spark]] inside the tube, which provided a shower of electrons that were taken up by the ions to form neutral atoms of a gas. Subsequent study of the spectra of the resulting gas showed that it was helium and that the alpha particles were indeed the hypothesized helium ions.\n\nBecause alpha particles occur naturally, but can have [[energy]] high enough to participate in a [[nuclear reaction]], study of them led to much early knowledge of [[nuclear physics]]. Rutherford used alpha particles emitted by [[radium bromide]] to infer that [[J. J. Thomson]]'s [[Plum pudding model]] of the atom was fundamentally flawed. In [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|Rutherford's gold foil experiment]] conducted by his students [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]], a narrow beam of alpha particles was established, passing through very thin (a few hundred atoms thick) gold foil. The alpha particles were detected by a [[zinc sulfide]] screen, which emits a flash of light upon an alpha particle collision. Rutherford hypothesized that, assuming the \"[[Plum pudding model|plum pudding]]\" model of the atom was correct, the positively charged alpha particles would be only slightly deflected, if at all, by the dispersed positive charge predicted.\n\nIt was found that some of the alpha particles were deflected at much larger angles than expected (at a suggestion by Rutherford to check it) and some even bounced almost directly back. Although most of the alpha particles went straight through as expected, Rutherford commented that the few particles that were deflected was akin to shooting a fifteen-inch shell at tissue paper only to have it bounce off, again assuming the \"plum pudding\" theory was correct. It was determined that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a small area in its center, making the positive charge dense enough to deflect any positively charged alpha particles that came close to what was later termed the nucleus.\n\nPrior to this discovery, it was not known that alpha particles were themselves atomic nuclei, nor was the existence of protons or neutrons known. After this discovery, J.J. Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model was abandoned, and Rutherford's experiment led to the [[Bohr model]] (named for [[Niels Bohr]]) and later the modern wave-mechanical model of the atom.\n\n[[File:Bragg Curve for Alphas in Air.png|thumb|Energy-loss ([[Bragg curve]]) in air for typical alpha particle emitted through radioactive decay.]]\n\n[[File:WolfhartFig1a.JPG|thumb|The trace of a single alpha particle obtained by nuclear physicist Wolfhart Willimczik with his spark chamber specially made for alpha particles.]]\n\nRutherford went on to use alpha particles to accidentally produce what he later understood as a directed [[nuclear transmutation]] of one element to another, in 1917. Transmutation of elements from one to another had been understood since 1901 as a result of natural [[radioactive decay]], but when Rutherford projected alpha particles from alpha decay into air, he discovered this produced a new type of radiation which proved to be hydrogen nuclei (Rutherford named these [[proton]]s). Further experimentation showed the protons to be coming from the nitrogen component of air, and the reaction was deduced to be a transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen in the reaction\n\n:<sup>14</sup>N + \u03b1 \u2192 <sup>17</sup>O + [[proton|p]]&nbsp;\n\nThis was the first discovered [[nuclear reaction]].\n\nTo the adjacent pictures: According to the energy-loss curve by Bragg, it is recognizable that the alpha particle indeed loses more energy on the end of the trace.<ref>Magazine \"nuclear energy\" (III/18 (203) special edition, Volume 10, Issue 2 /1967.</ref>\n\n==Anti-alpha particle==\nIn 2011, members of the international [[STAR collaboration]] using the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]'s [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] detected the [[antimatter]] partner of the helium nucleus, also known as the anti-alpha.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Agakishiev |first1=H.\n |author2=''et al.''

Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also sometimes written as {{chem|He|2+}} or {{chem|4|2|He|2+}} indicating a helium ion with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the [[ion]] gains electrons from its environment, the alpha particle becomes a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom {{chem|4|2|He}}.\n\nAlpha particles, like helium nuclei, have a net spin of zero. Due to the mechanism of their production in standard alpha [[radioactive decay]], alpha particles generally have a kinetic energy of about 5&nbsp;[[MeV]], and a velocity in the vicinity of 5% the speed of light. (See discussion below for the limits of these figures in alpha decay.)

A higher energy version of alphas than produced in alpha decay is a common product of an uncommon [[nuclear fission]] result called [[ternary fission]]. However, helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators ([[cyclotrons]], [[synchrotron]]s, and the like) are less likely to be referred to as \"alpha particles\".\n\n==Sources of alpha particles==\n\n===Alpha decay===\n[[File:Physicist Studying Alpha Rays GPN-2000-000381.jpg|thumb|300px|A physicist observes alpha particles from the decay of a polonium source in a [[cloud chamber]]]][[File:Alpha radiation in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|300px|Alpha radiation detected in an isopropanol [[cloud chamber]] (after injection of an artificial source radon-220).]]\n{{Main|Alpha decay}}\n\nThe best-known source of alpha particles is [[alpha decay]] of heavier (> 106 '''u''' atomic weight) atoms. When an [[atom]] emits an alpha particle in alpha decay, the atom's [[mass number]] decreases by four due to the loss of the four [[nucleon]]s in the alpha particle. The [[atomic number]] of the atom goes down by exactly two, as a result of the loss of two protons&nbsp;\u2013 the atom becomes a new element. Examples of this sort of [[nuclear transmutation]] are when [[uranium]] becomes [[thorium]], or [[radium]] becomes [[radon]] gas, due to alpha decay.\n\nAlpha particles are commonly emitted by all of the larger [[radioactive]] nuclei such as [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[actinium]], and [[radium]], as well as the [[transuranic]] elements. Unlike other types of decay, alpha decay as a process must have a minimum-size atomic nucleus that can support it. The smallest nuclei that have to date been found to be capable of alpha emission are [[beryllium-8]] and the lightest [[nuclides]] of [[tellurium]] (element 52), with mass numbers between 104 and 109. The process of alpha decay sometimes leaves the nucleus in an excited state, wherein the emission of a [[gamma ray]] then removes the excess [[energy]].\n\n====Mechanism of production in alpha decay====\nIn contrast to [[beta decay]], the [[fundamental interaction]]s responsible for alpha decay are a balance between the [[electromagnetic force]] and [[nuclear force]]. Alpha decay results from the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb repulsion]]<ref name=\"Krane\"/> between the alpha particle and the rest of the nucleus, which both have a positive [[electric charge]], but which is kept in check by the [[nuclear force]]. In [[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical physics]], alpha particles do not have enough energy to escape the [[potential well]] from the strong force inside the nucleus (this well involves escaping the strong force to go up one side of the well, which is followed by the electromagnetic force causing a repulsive push-off down the other side).\n\nHowever, the [[quantum tunneling|quantum tunnelling]] effect allows alphas to escape even though they do not have enough energy to overcome the [[nuclear force]]. This is allowed by the wave nature of matter, which allows the alpha particle to spend some of its time in a region so far from the nucleus that the potential from the repulsive electromagnetic force has fully compensated for the attraction of the nuclear force. From this point, alpha particles can escape, and in quantum mechanics, after a certain time, they do so.\n\n===Ternary fission===\nEspecially energetic alpha particles deriving from a nuclear process are produced in the relatively rare (one in a few hundred) [[nuclear fission]] process of [[ternary fission]]. In this process, three charged particles are produced from the event instead of the normal two, with the smallest of the charged particles most probably (90% probability) being an alpha particle. Such alpha particles are termed \"long range alphas\" since at their typical energy of 16 MeV, they are at far higher energy than is ever produced by alpha decay. Ternary fission happens in both neutron-induced fission (the [[nuclear reaction]] that happens in a nuclear reactor), and also when [[fissionable]] and [[fissile]] [[actinide]]s{{g}} nuclides (i.e., heavy atoms capable of fission) undergo [[spontaneous fission]] as a form of radioactive decay. In both induced and spontaneous fission, the higher energies available in heavy nuclei result in long range alphas of higher energy than those from alpha decay.\n\n===Accelerators===\nEnergetic helium nuclei may be produced by [[cyclotron]]s, [[synchrotron]]s, and other [[particle accelerator]]s, but they are not normally referred to as \"alpha particles.\"  {{Clarify|date=November 2019}}<!--What are they referred to as?-->\n\n===Solar core reactions===\nAs noted, helium nuclei may participate in nuclear reactions in stars, and occasionally and historically these have been referred to as alpha reactions (see for example [[triple alpha process]]).\n\n===Cosmic rays===\nIn addition, extremely high energy helium nuclei sometimes referred to as alpha particles make up about 10 to 12% of [[cosmic ray]]s. The mechanisms of cosmic ray production continue to be debated.\n\n==Energy and absorption==\nThe energy of the alpha particle emitted in [[alpha decay]] is mildly dependent on the half-life for the emission process, with many orders of magnitude differences in half-life being associated with energy changes of less than 50%.\n\nThe energy of alpha particles emitted varies, with higher energy alpha particles being emitted from larger nuclei, but most alpha particles have energies of between 3 and 7&nbsp;[[MeV]] (mega-electron-volts), corresponding to extremely long and extremely short half-lives of alpha-emitting nuclides, respectively.\n\nWith a typical kinetic energy of 5&nbsp;MeV; the speed of emitted alpha paarticles is 15,000&nbsp;km/s, which is 5% of the speed of light. This energy is a substantial amount of energy for a single particle, but their high mass means alpha particles have a lower speed than any other common type of radiation, e.g. [[Beta particle|\u03b2 particles]], [[neutron radiation|neutrons]].<ref>N.B. Since gamma rays are [[electromagnetic]] ([[light]]) they move at the speed of light (''c''). Beta particles often move at a large fraction of ''c'', and exceed 60%&nbsp;''c'' whenever their energy is >&nbsp;64&nbsp;keV, which it commonly is. Neutron velocity from nuclear reactions ranges from about 6%&nbsp;''c'' for fission to as much as 17%&nbsp;''c'' for fusion.</ref> \n\nBecause of their charge and large mass, alpha particles are easily absorbed by materials, and they can travel only a few centimetres in air. They can be absorbed by tissue paper or by the outer layers of human skin. They typically penetrate skin about 40&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s, equivalent to a few [[cell (biology)|cells]] deep.\n\n==Biological effects==\n{{main|relative biological effectiveness}}\n\nDue to the short range of absorption and inability to penetrate the outer layers of skin, alpha particles are not, in general, dangerous to life unless the source is ingested or inhaled.<ref name=\"Christensen2014\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Christensen |first=D.

It is the most strongly ionizing, and with large enough doses can cause any or all of the symptoms of [[radiation poisoning]]. It is estimated that [[chromosome]] damage from alpha particles is anywhere from 10 to 1000 times greater than that caused by an equivalent amount of gamma or beta radiation, with the average being set at 20 times. A study of European nuclear workers exposed internally to alpha radiation from plutonium and uranium found that when relative biological effectiveness is considered to be 20, the carcinogenic potential (in terms of lung cancer) of alpha radiation appears to be consistent with that reported for doses of external gamma radiation i.e. a given dose of alpha-particles inhaled presents the same risk as a 20-times higher dose of gamma radiation.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Grellier |first1=James\n |display-authors=etal\n |date=2017\n |title=Risk of lung cancer mortality in nuclear workers from internal exposure to alpha particle-emitting radionuclides\n|journal=Epidemiology\n |volume=28\n |issue=5\n |pages=675\u2013684\n |doi=10.1097/EDE.0000000000000684\n |pmid=28520643\n |pmc=5540354\n}}</ref> The powerful alpha emitter [[polonium-210]] (a milligram of <sup>210</sup>Po emits as many alpha particles per second as 4.215&nbsp;grams of [[Radium-226|<sup>226</sup>Ra]]) is suspected of playing a role in [[lung cancer]] and [[bladder cancer]] related to [[Tobacco and health#Radioactive components of tobacco|tobacco smoking]].<ref name=\"Science v143 no3603\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Radford |first=Edward P.\n |last2=Hunt |first2=Vilma R.\n |year=1964\n |title=Polonium-210: A Volatile Radioelement in Cigarettes\n |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]\n |volume=143\n |issue=3603\n |pages=247\u2013249\n |bibcode=1964Sci...143..247R\n |doi=10.1126/science.143.3603.247\n |pmid=14078362\n}}</ref> <sup>210</sup>Po was used to kill Russian dissident and ex-[[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] officer [[Alexander Litvinenko|Alexander V.

Rutherford (1903) [https://books.google.com/books?id=otXPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false \"The magnetic and electric deviation of the easily absorbed rays from radium,\"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', Series 6, vol. 5, no. 26, pages 177\u2013187.</ref> Alpha rays were defined by Rutherford as those having the lowest penetration of ordinary objects.\n\nRutherford's work also included measurements of the ratio of an alpha particle's mass to its charge, which led him to the hypothesis that alpha particles were doubly charged helium ions (later shown to be bare helium nuclei).<ref>{{The Timetables of Science|pages=411}}</ref> In 1907, [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Thomas Royds]] finally proved that alpha particles were indeed helium ions.<ref>E. Rutherford and T. Royds (1908) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hYTyA7h4FAsC&pg=PA313#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Spectrum of the radium emanation,\"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', Series 6, vol. 16, pages 313\u2013317.</ref> To do this they allowed alpha particles to penetrate a very thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, thus capturing a large number of the hypothesized helium ions inside the tube. They then caused an [[electric spark]] inside the tube, which provided a shower of electrons that were taken up by the ions to form neutral atoms of a gas. Subsequent study of the spectra of the resulting gas showed that it was helium and that the alpha particles were indeed the hypothesized helium ions.\n\nBecause alpha particles occur naturally, but can have [[energy]] high enough to participate in a [[nuclear reaction]], study of them led to much early knowledge of [[nuclear physics]]. Rutherford used alpha particles emitted by [[radium bromide]] to infer that [[J. J. Thomson]]'s [[Plum pudding model]] of the atom was fundamentally flawed. In [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|Rutherford's gold foil experiment]] conducted by his students [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]], a narrow beam of alpha particles was established, passing through very thin (a few hundred atoms thick) gold foil. The alpha particles were detected by a [[zinc sulfide]] screen, which emits a flash of light upon an alpha particle collision. Rutherford hypothesized that, assuming the \"[[Plum pudding model|plum pudding]]\" model of the atom was correct, the positively charged alpha particles would be only slightly deflected, if at all, by the dispersed positive charge predicted.\n\nIt was found that some of the alpha particles were deflected at much larger angles than expected (at a suggestion by Rutherford to check it) and some even bounced almost directly back. Although most of the alpha particles went straight through as expected, Rutherford commented that the few particles that were deflected was akin to shooting a fifteen-inch shell at tissue paper only to have it bounce off, again assuming the \"plum pudding\" theory was correct. It was determined that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a small area in its center, making the positive charge dense enough to deflect any positively charged alpha particles that came close to what was later termed the nucleus.\n\nPrior to this discovery, it was not known that alpha particles were themselves atomic nuclei, nor was the existence of protons or neutrons known. After this discovery, J.J. Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model was abandoned, and Rutherford's experiment led to the [[Bohr model]] (named for [[Niels Bohr]]) and later the modern wave-mechanical model of the atom.\n\n[[File:Bragg Curve for Alphas in Air.png|thumb|Energy-loss ([[Bragg curve]]) in air for typical alpha particle emitted through radioactive decay.]]\n\n[[File:WolfhartFig1a.JPG|thumb|The trace of a single alpha particle obtained by nuclear physicist Wolfhart Willimczik with his spark chamber specially made for alpha particles.]]\n\nRutherford went on to use alpha particles to accidentally produce what he later understood as a directed [[nuclear transmutation]] of one element to another, in 1917. Transmutation of elements from one to another had been understood since 1901 as a result of natural [[radioactive decay]], but when Rutherford projected alpha particles from alpha decay into air, he discovered this produced a new type of radiation which proved to be hydrogen nuclei (Rutherford named these [[proton]]s). Further experimentation showed the protons to be coming from the nitrogen component of air, and the reaction was deduced to be a transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen in the reaction\n\n:<sup>14</sup>N + \u03b1 \u2192 <sup>17</sup>O + [[proton|p]]&nbsp;\n\nThis was the first discovered [[nuclear reaction]].\n\nTo the adjacent pictures: According to the energy-loss curve by Bragg, it is recognizable that the alpha particle indeed loses more energy on the end of the trace.<ref>Magazine \"nuclear energy\" (III/18 (203) special edition, Volume 10, Issue 2 /1967.</ref>\n\n==Anti-alpha particle==\nIn 2011, members of the international [[STAR collaboration]] using the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]'s [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] detected the [[antimatter]] partner of the helium nucleus, also known as the anti-alpha.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Agakishiev |first1=H.\n |author2=''et al.''

Smoke particles from fire that enter the air gap reduce the current flow, sounding the alarm. The isotope is extremely dangerous if inhaled or ingested, but the danger is minimal if the source is kept sealed. Many municipalities have established programs to collect and dispose of old smoke detectors, to keep them out of the general waste stream.\n* Alpha decay can provide a safe power source for [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s used for [[space probe]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|artificial heart pacemakers]].

After the defeat of the Italian colonial army in 1942, Eritrea was administered by the [[British Military Administration (Eritrea)|British Military Administration]] until 1952. Following the UN General Assembly decision, in 1952, Eritrea would govern itself with a local Eritrean parliament but for foreign affairs and defense it would enter into a federal status with Ethiopia for a period of 10 years. However, in 1962 the government of Ethiopia annulled the Eritrean parliament and formally annexed Eritrea, but the Eritreans who had argued for complete Eritrean independence since the ouster of the Italians in 1941 anticipated what was coming and, in 1961, organized the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] in opposition. In 1991, after 30 years of continuous armed struggle for independence, the Eritrean liberation fighters entered the capital city, Asmara, in victory.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]]  is a [[totalitarian]] [[one-party]] [[dictatorship]] in which [[Elections in Eritrea|national legislative and presidential elections]] have never been held since independence.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"Eritrea\u2019s Silent Totalitarianism - McGill Journal of Political Studies\" /> According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Human rights in Eritrea|Eritrean government's human rights record]] is among the worst in the world.<ref name=\"hrw\"/> The Eritrean government has dismissed these allegations as politically motivated.<ref name=\"Tesf\">{{cite web|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND ERITREA'S REALITY|url=http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|website=E Smart|publisher=E Smart Campaign|accessdate=12 June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084731/http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> The compulsory military service requires long, indefinite conscription periods (6.5 years on average), which some Eritreans leave the country to avoid.<ref name=\"National service in Eritrea\"/> Because all local media is state-owned, Eritrea was also ranked as having the third-least press freedom in the global [[Press Freedom Index]], behind [[North Korea]] and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Eritrea is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]], and is an [[Member_states_of_the_Arab_League#List_of_current_observer_states|observer state]] in the [[Arab League]] alongside [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name=\"edition.cnn.com\">[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/30/world/meast/arab-league-fast-facts/ Arab League Fast Facts \u2013 CNN.com].

It is bordered to the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]], [[Sudan]] to the west, [[Ethiopia]] to the south, and [[Djibouti]] to the southeast. Eritrea lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel north|18\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[36th meridian east|36\u00b0]] and [[44th meridian east|44\u00b0E]].\n\nThe country is virtually bisected by a branch of the [[East African Rift]]. Eritrea, at the southern end of the Red Sea, is the home of the fork in the rift. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds are situated off the sandy and arid coastline.\n\n[[File:Dahlak reliefmap.png|thumb|left|upright|150px|The [[Dahlak Archipelago]]]]\n[[File:Dahlak Islands ISS042.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Dahlak Islands in the Red Sea as seen from the International Space Station]]\n\nEritrea can be split into three [[ecoregion]]s. To the east of the highlands are the hot, arid coastal plains stretching down to the southeast of the country. The cooler, more fertile highlands, reaching up to 3000 m, have a different habitat. Habitats here vary from the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|sub-tropical rainforest]] at Filfil Solomona to the precipitous cliffs and [[canyon]]s of the southern highlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eritrea|publisher=fatbirder.com|url=http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/africa/eritrea.html}}</ref>\nThe [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another.

During the coffee ceremony, there are traditions that are upheld. The coffee is served in three rounds: the first brew or round is called ''awel'' in Tigrinya (meaning \"first\"), the second round is called ''kalaay'' (meaning \"second\"), and the third round is called ''bereka'' (meaning \"to be blessed\").\n\nTraditional Eritrean attire is quite varied among the ethnic groups of Eritrea. In the larger cities, most people dress in Western casual dress such as jeans and shirts. In offices, both men and women often dress in suits. A common traditional clothing for [[Christians|Christian]] Tigrayan highlanders consists of bright white gowns called ''[[zuria]]s'' for the women, and a white shirt accompanied by white pants for the men.

After the defeat of the Italian colonial army in 1942, Eritrea was administered by the [[British Military Administration (Eritrea)|British Military Administration]] until 1952. Following the UN General Assembly decision, in 1952, Eritrea would govern itself with a local Eritrean parliament but for foreign affairs and defense it would enter into a federal status with Ethiopia for a period of 10 years. However, in 1962 the government of Ethiopia annulled the Eritrean parliament and formally annexed Eritrea, but the Eritreans who had argued for complete Eritrean independence since the ouster of the Italians in 1941 anticipated what was coming and, in 1961, organized the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] in opposition.

The diversity in landscape and topography in the highlands and lowlands of Eritrea result in the diversity of climate across the country. The highlands  have temperate climate throughout the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid. The distribution of rainfall and vegetation types varies markedly throughout the country. Eritrean climate varies on the basis of seasonal and altitudinal differences.\n\nBased on variations in temperature, Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: the temperate zone, subtropical climate zone, and tropical climate zone.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tesfagiorgis, Mussie |title=Eritrea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&pg=PA10 |date=29 October 2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-232-6 |pages=10\u2013}}</ref>\n{{Weather box\n|location = Eritrea in general, based on 14 cities\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|temperature colour = pastel\n|Jan high C = 27.3\n|Feb high C = 28.3\n|Mar high C = 29.8\n|Apr high C = 32.3\n|May high C = 33.3\n|Jun high C = 33\n|Jul high C = 32\n|Aug high C = 31.5\n|Sep high C = 32.3\n|Oct high C = 31.8\n|Nov high C = 30\n|Dec high C = 28.3\n|year high C = 31\n|Jan mean C = 20\n|Feb mean C = 20.8\n|Mar mean C = 22.5\n|Apr mean C = 24.3\n|May mean C = 25.6\n|Jun mean C = 26\n|Jul mean C = 25.1\n|Aug mean C = 24.7\n|Sep mean C = 24.4\n|Oct mean C = 23.8\n|Nov mean C = 22.1\n|Dec mean C = 20.5\n|year mean C = 23.3\n|Jan low C = 17.8\n|Feb low C = 17.3\n|Mar low C = 18.3\n|Apr low C = 21\n|May low C = 23.3\n|Jun low C = 24.4\n|Jul low C = 24.4\n|Aug low C = 24.5\n|Sep low C = 23.3\n|Oct low C = 22.3\n|Nov low C = 20\n|Dec low C = 18.3\n|year low C = 20.8\n|Jan precipitation mm = 6.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 6.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 14.8\n|May precipitation mm = 20.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 26.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 100\n|Aug precipitation mm = 99.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 25.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 8.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 11.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 9.4\n|year precipitation mm = 347\n|source 1 = weatherbase<ref name= weatherbase>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/city.php3?c=ER&name=Eritrea\n| title = Eritrea average climate\n| publisher = weatherbase\n| accessdate = 6 March 2016}}</ref>\n|date=March 2016\n}}\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{main|Politics of Eritrea}}\n{{advert|section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:National Assembly of Eritrea.svg|thumb|130px|The National Assembly of Eritrea]]\n[[File:Flag of Eritrea.svg|thumb|right|The wreath with the upright olive-branch symbol derived from the 1952 flag, which had a light blue background to honour the United Nations.

Accordingly, several similar colleges are also established in different other parts of the country. The Eritrea Institute of Technology is the main local institute of higher studies in science, engineering and education.

During the coffee ceremony, there are traditions that are upheld. The coffee is served in three rounds: the first brew or round is called ''awel'' in Tigrinya (meaning \"first\"), the second round is called ''kalaay'' (meaning \"second\"), and the third round is called ''bereka'' (meaning \"to be blessed\").\n\nTraditional Eritrean attire is quite varied among the ethnic groups of Eritrea. In the larger cities, most people dress in Western casual dress such as jeans and shirts. In offices, both men and women often dress in suits. A common traditional clothing for [[Christians|Christian]] Tigrayan highlanders consists of bright white gowns called ''[[zuria]]s'' for the women, and a white shirt accompanied by white pants for the men. In Muslim communities in the Eritrean lowland, the women traditionally dress in brightly colored clothes.

Any other person may informally participate as part of the \"B Team.\" After CAML comes the state meet which the top 2 schools of each size from CAML advanced to the Connecticut State Association of Mathematics League (CSAML) in March. The top 2 schools of each division advance to the New England Association of Mathematics League (NEAML) meet.\n\nThe Math Team historically existed until approximately 2010 (anyone know?) when the previous coach became unable to continue the math team. Since then, no other teacher or student has stepped up to revive the team until math teacher Andrew Brindisi stepped up in 2016 (anyone know?) to continue it. This new math team has increasing performed better in the leagues, some notable participates listed here: Aryan Kalia, Carter Cobb, Jaideep Naik, Keshav Ramesh, Michael Ngo, and Pranav Ramesh. These mathletes have exceed in other mathematical competitions such as the [[American Mathematics Competitions]] (AMC), the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] (AIME), [[Mathcounts]], the [https://www.mathleague.com/ New England Mathematics League] (NEML), the [https://www.usamts.org/ United States of America Mathematics Talent Search] (USAMTS), and the [[American Regions Mathematics League]] (ARML).\n\n=== String Orchestra ===\nSWHS has one string orchestra open to all students composed of basses, cellos, violas, and violins (usually 70 or more).

In order to enter the chamber orchestra, a student must audition for the conductor previously and be selected. \n\n=== Bobcat Robotics ===\nSWHS's [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] (FRC) team is given the name of [[Bobcat Robotics]] and the team number of 177. They were first created in 1995 by teacher Al M. and a few STEM-inspired students. Since then, Bobcat Robotics has excelled in FRC, winning the international championship in 2007 and 2010. Bobcat Robotics is dedicated the growth and development of students in STEM and core values so that one day, we might have a community of positive and cooperable people that will benefit the community greatly. Bobcat Robotics is split into 4 subteams: Mechanical, CAD, MBA, and  Controls.\n\nBobcat Robotics has reached deeply into the community by hosting many demonstrations to inspire younger kids of STEM.

From October to February, 6 meets are held for the central region of CT, called the Capital Area Math League (CAML). Each meet consists of 5 rounds of elementary subjects ranging from arithmetic to complex numbers. Each round has 3 problems ranging from 1 to 3 points each (max of 6 points total). Each school is allotted a 5 person \"A Team\" to count towards their total points. Any other person may informally participate as part of the \"B Team.\" After CAML comes the state meet which the top 2 schools of each size from CAML advanced to the Connecticut State Association of Mathematics League (CSAML) in March. The top 2 schools of each division advance to the New England Association of Mathematics League (NEAML) meet.\n\nThe Math Team historically existed until approximately 2010 (anyone know?) when the previous coach became unable to continue the math team. Since then, no other teacher or student has stepped up to revive the team until math teacher Andrew Brindisi stepped up in 2016 (anyone know?) to continue it. This new math team has increasing performed better in the leagues, some notable participates listed here: Aryan Kalia, Carter Cobb, Jaideep Naik, Keshav Ramesh, Michael Ngo, and Pranav Ramesh. These mathletes have exceed in other mathematical competitions such as the [[American Mathematics Competitions]] (AMC), the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] (AIME), [[Mathcounts]], the [https://www.mathleague.com/ New England Mathematics League] (NEML), the [https://www.usamts.org/ United States of America Mathematics Talent Search] (USAMTS), and the [[American Regions Mathematics League]] (ARML).\n\n=== String Orchestra ===\nSWHS has one string orchestra open to all students composed of basses, cellos, violas, and violins (usually 70 or more). They play easy to intermediate pieces for their local winter and spring concerts at SWHS and compete at the [[Music in the Parks]] Competition.\n\nSWHS has one chamber orchestra consisting of 16-19 basses, cellos, violas, and violins. They play intermediate classical, romantic, baroque, and contemporary pieces for their local winter and spring concerts at SWHS. They also compete at various different competitions [insert some]. They also play communally, whether at school or at the community center, and are visited by many professional musicians to improve their playing. In order to enter the chamber orchestra, a student must audition for the conductor previously and be selected. \n\n=== Bobcat Robotics ===\nSWHS's [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] (FRC) team is given the name of [[Bobcat Robotics]] and the team number of 177. They were first created in 1995 by teacher Al M. and a few STEM-inspired students. Since then, Bobcat Robotics has excelled in FRC, winning the international championship in 2007 and 2010. Bobcat Robotics is dedicated the growth and development of students in STEM and core values so that one day, we might have a community of positive and cooperable people that will benefit the community greatly. Bobcat Robotics is split into 4 subteams: Mechanical, CAD, MBA, and  Controls.\n\nBobcat Robotics has reached deeply into the community by hosting many demonstrations to inspire younger kids of STEM. Some of their students have recently reached out by creating their own [[FIRST Lego League|FIRST LEGO League]] (FLL) Regional Tournament and [[FIRST Tech Challenge]] Tournament.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n<!-- Please maintain the alphabetical order of this list -->\n*[[Romil Hemnani]] member of the musical group [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]]\n*[[Brent Morin]] Actor, Comedian\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://highschool.southwindsorschools.org/ South Windsor High School]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Central Connecticut Conference}}\n\n[[Category:Schools in Hartford County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:South Windsor, Connecticut]]\n", "name_user": "Puzzlephantom", "label": "safe", "comment": "update on corona", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Windsor_High_School"}

Adelaide was the daughter of [[George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]], and [[Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]].\n\n[[Adelaide]], the capital city of [[South Australia]], is named after her.<ref>[[Rodney Cockburn]], ''South Australia What's in a Name?'' Adelaide: Axiom Publishing. 3rd Edition. Reprinted 2002 Pg 3.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Schloss01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elisabethenburg Palace]], the residence of the Dukes of [[Saxe-Meiningen]]]]\nAdelaide was born on 13 August 1792 at [[Meiningen]], [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], the eldest child of [[George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]]; her mother was [[Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Luise Eleonore]], daughter of [[Christian Albrecht, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]]. She was titled ''poo poo wee wee, Duchess in Saxony'' with the style ''[[Serene Highness]]'' from her birth until the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), when the entire [[House of Wettin]] was raised to the style of ''[[Highness]]''. She was baptised at the castle chapel on 19 August. Her godparents numbered twenty-one, including her mother, the [[Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily|Holy Roman Empress]], the [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Queen of Naples and Sicily]], the [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1767\u20131827)|Crown Princess of Saxony]], the [[Princess Charlotte of Saxe-Meiningen|Duchess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], the [[Princess Sophie Antoinette of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg]], the [[Landgravine Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt (1757\u20131830)|Duchess of Saxe-Weimar]], the [[Karl Ludwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], and the [[Adolph, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld|Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld]].<ref>Sandars, p.17</ref>\n\n[[Saxe-Meiningen]] was a small state, covering about {{convert|423|sqmi|km2}}. It was the most liberal German state and, unlike its neighbours, permitted a free press and criticism of the ruler.<ref>Allen, pp.64\u201365</ref> At the time, no statute existed which barred a female ruling over the small duchy and it was not until the birth of her brother, [[Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen|Bernhard]], in 1800, that the law of [[primogeniture]] was introduced.<ref>Sandars, p.15</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:1722B.jpg|thumb|left|Wax figure of Queen Adelaide, 1830]]\nBy the end of 1811, [[King George III]] was incapacitated and, although he was still king in name, his heir-apparent and eldest son, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], was [[regent]]. On 6 November 1817 the Prince Regent's only child, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], died in childbirth. Princess Charlotte was second in line to the throne: had she outlived her father and grandfather, she would have become queen. With her death, the King was left with twelve children and no legitimate grandchildren. The Prince Regent was estranged from his wife, who was forty-nine years old, thus there was little likelihood that he would have any further legitimate children. To secure the line of succession, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Prince William, Duke of Clarence]], and the other sons of George III sought quick marriages with the intent of producing offspring who could inherit the throne. William already had ten children by the popular actress [[Dorothea Jordan]], but, being illegitimate, they were barred from the succession.\n\nConsiderable allowances were likely to be voted by Parliament to any [[royal duke]] who married, and this acted as a further incentive for William to marry. Adelaide was a princess from an unimportant German state, but William had a limited choice of available princesses and, after deals with other candidates fell through, a marriage to Adelaide was arranged. The allowance proposed was slashed by Parliament, and the outraged Duke considered calling off the marriage. However, Adelaide seemed the ideal candidate: amiable, home-loving, and willing to accept William's illegitimate children as part of the family.<ref>Ziegler, pp.118\u2013121</ref> The arrangement was settled and William wrote to his eldest son, \"She is doomed, ''poor dear innocent young'' creature, to be my wife.\"<ref>William writing to [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|George FitzClarence]], 21 March 1818, quoted in Ziegler, p.122</ref>\n\nAdelaide's dowry was set at 20,000 florins, with additional three separate annuities being promised by her future husband, the English regent, and the state of Saxe-Meiningen.<ref>Sandars, p.44 - [Adelaide's] dowry was to consist of 20,000 florins, from which, as long as she was childless, she was to receive interest at the rate of 5 per cent. When children came, however, she was to have 5,000 florins a year. The state of Saxe-Meiningen was also to provide her with an income of 6,000 florins a year as pin-money. William, on his side, promised that he would maintain the household of his future bride, and would in addition give her 2,000 a year. If his income were augmented doubtless from his becoming nearer in succession to the throne her allowance should, he promised, be increased to 3,000. On a second document the Regent undertook, on behalf of George III, that in the event of the death of the Duke of Clarence, the Duchess should, during her widowhood, receive 6,000 a year.</ref>\n\nAdelaide married William in a double wedding with William's brother, [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], and his bride [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Victoria, Dowager Princess of Leiningen]], on 11 July 1818, at [[Kew Palace]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]]. They had only met for the first time about a week earlier,<ref>Ziegler, p.124</ref> on 4 July at Grillon's Hotel in [[Bond Street]].<ref>Allen, p.59</ref> Neither William nor Adelaide had been married before, and William was twenty-seven years her senior.\n\nDespite these unromantic circumstances, the couple settled amicably in [[Hanover]] (where the cost of living was much lower than in England), and by all accounts were devoted to each other throughout their marriage. Adelaide improved William's behaviour; he drank less, swore less and became more tactful.<ref>Ziegler, pp.123, 129</ref> Observers thought them parsimonious, and their lifestyle simple, even boring.<ref>Dr. William Beattie, quoted in Ziegler, p.130, and [[Dorothea Lieven|Princess Lieven]] and [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|Lord Camden]], quoted in Ziegler, pp.156\u2013157</ref> William eventually accepted the reduced increase in his allowance voted by Parliament.<ref>Ziegler, p.129</ref>\n\nOn the Continent, Adelaide became pregnant, but in her seventh month of pregnancy, she caught [[pleurisy]] and gave birth prematurely on 27 March 1819 during the illness. Her daughter, Charlotte, lived only a few hours. Another pregnancy in the same year caused William to move the household to England so his future heir would be born on British soil, yet Adelaide miscarried at [[Calais]] or [[Dunkirk]] during the journey on 5 September 1819. Back in London, they moved into [[Clarence House]], but preferred to stay at [[Bushy House]] near Hampton Court where William had already lived with [[Dorothea Jordan]]. She became pregnant again, and a second daughter, [[Princess Elizabeth of Clarence|Elizabeth]], was born on 10 December 1820. Elizabeth seemed strong but died less than three months old on 4 March 1821 of \"inflammation in the Bowels\".<ref>Ziegler, p.127</ref> Ultimately, William and Adelaide had no surviving children. Twin boys were stillborn on 8 April 1822,<ref>Ziegler, pp.126\u2013127</ref> and a possible brief pregnancy may have occurred within the same year.\n\n[[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria of Kent]] came to be acknowledged as William's heir presumptive, as Adelaide had no further pregnancies. While there were rumours of pregnancies well into William's reign (dismissed by the King as \"damned stuff\"), they seem to have been without basis.<ref>Ziegler, p.268</ref>\n\n==Queen consort==\n\n[[File:Bushy House, Bushy Park - geograph.org.uk - 362754.jpg|thumb|[[Bushy House]]]]\nAt the time of their marriage, William was not heir-presumptive to the throne, but became so when his brother [[Frederick, Duke of York]], died childless in 1827. Given the small likelihood of his older brothers producing heirs, and William's relative youth and good health, it had long been considered extremely likely that he would become king in due course. In 1830, on the death of his elder brother, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], William acceded to the throne. One of King William's first acts was to confer the Rangership of [[Bushy Park]] (for thirty-three years held by himself) on Queen Adelaide.<ref>Greville, p.52</ref> This act allowed Adelaide to remain at [[Bushy House]] for her lifetime.\n\n[[File:Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Queen Adelaide painted by [[John Simpson (artist)|John Simpson]] in 1832]]\nThe King and Adelaide were [[Coronation of William IV and Adelaide|crowned]] on 8 September 1831 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Adelaide was deeply religious and took the service very seriously. William despised the ceremony, and acted throughout, it is presumed deliberately, as if he was \"a character in a comic opera\", making a mockery of what he thought to be a ridiculous charade.<ref>Allen, p.131</ref> Adelaide alone among those attending received any praise for her \"dignity, repose and characteristic grace\".<ref>Baroness von B\u00fclow, quoted in Allen, pp.131\u2013132</ref>\n\nAdelaide was beloved by the British people for her piety, modesty, charity, and her tragic childbirth history. A large portion of her household income was given to charitable causes. She also treated the young Princess Victoria of Kent (William's heir presumptive and later [[Queen Victoria]]) with kindness, despite her own inability to produce an heir and the open hostility between William and Victoria's mother, [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Dowager Duchess of Kent]]. She refused to have women of questionable virtue attend her Court. Wrote Clerk of the [[Privy Council]] [[Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville|Charles Greville]] of her, \"The Queen is a prude and refuses to have the ladies come ''d\u00e9collet\u00e9es'' to her parties. George the 4th, who liked ample expanses of that kind, would not let them be covered.\"<ref>Greville, p.67</ref>\n\nAdelaide attempted, perhaps unsuccessfully, to influence the King politically. She never spoke about politics in public; however, she was strongly [[Tory]].<ref>Ziegler, p.175</ref> It is unclear how much of William's attitudes during the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]] were due to her influence. The Press, the public and courtiers assumed that she was agitating behind the scenes against reform,<ref>Allen, pp.114, 126 and Ziegler, pp.83, 199</ref> but she was careful to be non-committal in public.<ref>Ziegler, pp.187, 210\u2013211</ref> As a result of her alleged partiality, she became unpopular with reformers.<ref>Ziegler, pp.216\u2013221</ref> Unbelievable rumours circulated that she was having an affair with her [[Lord Chamberlain]], the Tory [[Richard Curzon-Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], but almost everyone at court knew that Adelaide was inflexibly pious and was always faithful to her husband.<ref>Ziegler, pp.198, 238</ref> The Whig Prime Minister, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], had Lord Howe removed from Adelaide's household. Attempts to reinstate him after the Reform Bill had passed were not successful, as Lord Grey and Lord Howe could not come to an agreement as to how independent Howe could be of the government.<ref>Ziegler, pp.237\u2013238</ref>\n\nIn October 1834, a great fire destroyed much of the [[Palace of Westminster]], which Adelaide considered divine retribution for the vagaries of reform.<ref>Ziegler, p.250</ref> When the Whig ministry of [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] was dismissed by the King, ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper blamed the Queen's influence, though she seems to have had very little to do with it.<ref>Ziegler, pp.256\u2013257 and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], quoted in Allen, p.179</ref> Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]], she did write to the King against reform of the [[Church of Ireland]].<ref>[[Herbert Taylor (British Army officer)|Sir Herbert Taylor]], the King's secretary, writing to [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], 15 July 1835, quoted in Ziegler, p.276</ref>\n\nBoth William and Adelaide were fond of their niece, Princess Victoria of Kent, and wanted her to be closer to them. Their efforts were frustrated by Victoria's mother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]]. The Duchess refused to acknowledge Adelaide's precedence, left letters from Adelaide unanswered and commandeered space in the royal stables and apartments for her own use. The King, aggrieved at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, bluntly announced in the presence of Adelaide, the Duchess, Victoria and many guests, that the Duchess was \"incompetent to act with propriety\", that he had been \"grossly and continually insulted by that person\", and that he hoped to have the satisfaction of living beyond Victoria's age of majority, so that the Duchess of Kent would never be Regent. Everyone was aghast at the vehemence of the speech, and all three ladies were deeply upset.<ref>Allen, pp.223\u2013224</ref> The breach between the Duchess and the King and Queen was never fully healed, but Victoria always viewed both of them with kindness.<ref>Allen, p.225</ref>\n\n==Queen dowager==\n[[File:QueenAdelaide.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Portrait of Queen Adelaide painted by [[Martin Archer Shee|Sir Martin Archer Shee]] in 1836.]]\nQueen Adelaide was dangerously ill in April 1837, at around the same time that she was present at her mother's deathbed in Meiningen, but she recovered.<ref>Ziegler, p.286</ref> By June, it became evident that the King was fatally ill himself.

The capital city of [[Adelaide]] was named after her at its founding in 1836; the [[Queen Adelaide Club]] for women is still active, and a bronze statue of Queen Adelaide stands in the foyer of the Town Hall. The Queen Adelaide Society was inaugurated in Adelaide in 1981 by the late Dorothy Howie with the twin objectives of promoting public awareness of Queen Adelaide and to provide an annual donation to a South Australian children's charity.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Queen Adelaide Society Inc. |url=http://www.queenadelaidesociety.com |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere is a village named [[Queen Adelaide, Cambridgeshire|Queen Adelaide]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], which takes its name from one of the many public houses named after the queen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Adelaide Village Hall|url=http://www.hallsforhire.org.uk/halls/queen-adelaide-village-hall/}}</ref>\n\nThere are Adelaide Streets, Adelaide Avenues and Adelaide Roads throughout the former empire; there is also  [[Adelaide Hospital (Dublin)|Adelaide Hospital]] (now the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght) in [[Dublin]], and an Adelaide railway station in Belfast.

Adelaide was the daughter of [[George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]], and [[Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]].\n\n[[Adelaide]], the capital city of [[South Australia]], is named after her.<ref>[[Rodney Cockburn]], ''South Australia What's in a Name?'' Adelaide: Axiom Publishing. 3rd Edition. Reprinted 2002 Pg 3.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Schloss01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elisabethenburg Palace]], the residence of the Dukes of [[Saxe-Meiningen]]]]\nAdelaide was born on 13 August 1792 at [[Meiningen]], [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], the eldest child of [[George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]]; her mother was [[Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Luise Eleonore]], daughter of [[Christian Albrecht, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]]. She was titled ''Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, Duchess in Saxony'' with the style ''[[Serene Highness]]'' from her birth until the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), when the entire [[House of Wettin]] was raised to the style of ''[[Highness]]''. She was baptised at the castle chapel on 19 August. Her godparents numbered twenty-one, including her mother, the [[Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily|Holy Roman Empress]], the [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Queen of Naples and Sicily]], the [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1767\u20131827)|Crown Princess of Saxony]], the [[Princess Charlotte of Saxe-Meiningen|Duchess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], the [[Princess Sophie Antoinette of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg]], the [[Landgravine Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt (1757\u20131830)|Duchess of Saxe-Weimar]], the [[Karl Ludwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], and the [[Adolph, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld|Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld]].<ref>Sandars, p.17</ref>\n\n[[Saxe-Meiningen]] was a small state, covering about {{convert|423|sqmi|km2}}. It was the most liberal German state and, unlike its neighbours, permitted a free press and criticism of the ruler.<ref>Allen, pp.64\u201365</ref> At the time, no statute existed which barred a female ruling over the small duchy and it was not until the birth of her brother, [[Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen|Bernhard]], in 1800, that the law of [[primogeniture]] was introduced.<ref>Sandars, p.15</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:1722B.jpg|thumb|left|Wax figure of Queen Adelaide, 1830]]\nBy the end of 1811, [[King George III]] was incapacitated and, although he was still king in name, his heir-apparent and eldest son, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], was [[regent]]. On 6 November 1817 the Prince Regent's only child, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], died in childbirth. Princess Charlotte was second in line to the throne: had she outlived her father and grandfather, she would have become queen. With her death, the King was left with twelve children and no legitimate grandchildren. The Prince Regent was estranged from his wife, who was forty-nine years old, thus there was little likelihood that he would have any further legitimate children. To secure the line of succession, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Prince William, Duke of Clarence]], and the other sons of George III sought quick marriages with the intent of producing offspring who could inherit the throne. William already had ten children by the popular actress [[Dorothea Jordan]], but, being illegitimate, they were barred from the succession.\n\nConsiderable allowances were likely to be voted by Parliament to any [[royal duke]] who married, and this acted as a further incentive for William to marry. Adelaide was a princess from an unimportant German state, but William had a limited choice of available princesses and, after deals with other candidates fell through, a marriage to Adelaide was arranged. The allowance proposed was slashed by Parliament, and the outraged Duke considered calling off the marriage. However, Adelaide seemed the ideal candidate: amiable, home-loving, and willing to accept William's illegitimate children as part of the family.<ref>Ziegler, pp.118\u2013121</ref> The arrangement was settled and William wrote to his eldest son, \"She is doomed, ''poor dear innocent young'' creature, to be my wife.\"<ref>William writing to [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|George FitzClarence]], 21 March 1818, quoted in Ziegler, p.122</ref>\n\nAdelaide's dowry was set at 20,000 florins, with additional three separate annuities being promised by her future husband, the English regent, and the state of Saxe-Meiningen.<ref>Sandars, p.44 - [Adelaide's] dowry was to consist of 20,000 florins, from which, as long as she was childless, she was to receive interest at the rate of 5 per cent. When children came, however, she was to have 5,000 florins a year. The state of Saxe-Meiningen was also to provide her with an income of 6,000 florins a year as pin-money. William, on his side, promised that he would maintain the household of his future bride, and would in addition give her 2,000 a year. If his income were augmented doubtless from his becoming nearer in succession to the throne her allowance should, he promised, be increased to 3,000. On a second document the Regent undertook, on behalf of George III, that in the event of the death of the Duke of Clarence, the Duchess should, during her widowhood, receive 6,000 a year.</ref>\n\nAdelaide married William in a double wedding with William's brother, [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], and his bride [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Victoria, Dowager Princess of Leiningen]], on 11 July 1818, at [[Kew Palace]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]]. They had only met for the first time about a week earlier,<ref>Ziegler, p.124</ref> on 4 July at Grillon's Hotel in [[Bond Street]].<ref>Allen, p.59</ref> Neither William nor Adelaide had been married before, and William was twenty-seven years her senior.\n\nDespite these unromantic circumstances, the couple settled amicably in [[Hanover]] (where the cost of living was much lower than in England), and by all accounts were devoted to each other throughout their marriage. Adelaide improved William's behaviour; he drank less, swore less and became more tactful.<ref>Ziegler, pp.123, 129</ref> Observers thought them parsimonious, and their lifestyle simple, even boring.<ref>Dr. William Beattie, quoted in Ziegler, p.130, and [[Dorothea Lieven|Princess Lieven]] and [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|Lord Camden]], quoted in Ziegler, pp.156\u2013157</ref> William eventually accepted the reduced increase in his allowance voted by Parliament.<ref>Ziegler, p.129</ref>\n\nOn the Continent, Adelaide became pregnant, but in her seventh month of pregnancy, she caught [[pleurisy]] and gave birth prematurely on 27 March 1819 during the illness. Her daughter, Charlotte, lived only a few hours. Another pregnancy in the same year caused William to move the household to England so his future heir would be born on British soil, yet Adelaide miscarried at [[Calais]] or [[Dunkirk]] during the journey on 5 September 1819. Back in London, they moved into [[Clarence House]], but preferred to stay at [[Bushy House]] near Hampton Court where William had already lived with [[Dorothea Jordan]]. She became pregnant again, and a second daughter, [[Princess Elizabeth of Clarence|Elizabeth]], was born on 10 December 1820. Elizabeth seemed strong but died less than three months old on 4 March 1821 of \"inflammation in the Bowels\".<ref>Ziegler, p.127</ref> Ultimately, William and Adelaide had no surviving children. Twin boys were stillborn on 8 April 1822,<ref>Ziegler, pp.126\u2013127</ref> and a possible brief pregnancy may have occurred within the same year.\n\n[[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria of Kent]] came to be acknowledged as William's heir presumptive, as Adelaide had no further pregnancies. While there were rumours of pregnancies well into William's reign (dismissed by the King as \"damned stuff\"), they seem to have been without basis.<ref>Ziegler, p.268</ref>\n\n==Queen consort==\n\n[[File:Bushy House, Bushy Park - geograph.org.uk - 362754.jpg|thumb|[[Bushy House]]]]\nAt the time of their marriage, William was not heir-presumptive to the throne, but became so when his brother [[Frederick, Duke of York]], died childless in 1827. Given the small likelihood of his older brothers producing heirs, and William's relative youth and good health, it had long been considered extremely likely that he would become king in due course. In 1830, on the death of his elder brother, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], William acceded to the throne. One of King William's first acts was to confer the Rangership of [[Bushy Park]] (for thirty-three years held by himself) on Queen Adelaide.<ref>Greville, p.52</ref> This act allowed Adelaide to remain at [[Bushy House]] for her lifetime.\n\n[[File:Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Queen Adelaide painted by [[John Simpson (artist)|John Simpson]] in 1832]]\nThe King and Adelaide were [[Coronation of William IV and Adelaide|crowned]] on 8 September 1831 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Adelaide was deeply religious and took the service very seriously. William despised the ceremony, and acted throughout, it is presumed deliberately, as if he was \"a character in a comic opera\", making a mockery of what he thought to be a ridiculous charade.<ref>Allen, p.131</ref> Adelaide alone among those attending received any praise for her \"dignity, repose and characteristic grace\".<ref>Baroness von B\u00fclow, quoted in Allen, pp.131\u2013132</ref>\n\nAdelaide was beloved by the British people for her piety, modesty, charity, and her tragic childbirth history. A large portion of her household income was given to charitable causes. She also treated the young Princess Victoria of Kent (William's heir presumptive and later [[Queen Victoria]]) with kindness, despite her own inability to produce an heir and the open hostility between William and Victoria's mother, [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Dowager Duchess of Kent]]. She refused to have women of questionable virtue attend her Court. Wrote Clerk of the [[Privy Council]] [[Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville|Charles Greville]] of her, \"The Queen is a prude and refuses to have the ladies come ''d\u00e9collet\u00e9es'' to her parties. George the 4th, who liked ample expanses of that kind, would not let them be covered.\"<ref>Greville, p.67</ref>\n\nAdelaide attempted, perhaps unsuccessfully, to influence the King politically. She never spoke about politics in public; however, she was strongly [[Tory]].<ref>Ziegler, p.175</ref> It is unclear how much of William's attitudes during the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]] were due to her influence. The Press, the public and courtiers assumed that she was agitating behind the scenes against reform,<ref>Allen, pp.114, 126 and Ziegler, pp.83, 199</ref> but she was careful to be non-committal in public.<ref>Ziegler, pp.187, 210\u2013211</ref> As a result of her alleged partiality, she became unpopular with reformers.<ref>Ziegler, pp.216\u2013221</ref> Unbelievable rumours circulated that she was having an affair with her [[Lord Chamberlain]], the Tory [[Richard Curzon-Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], but almost everyone at court knew that Adelaide was inflexibly pious and was always faithful to her husband.<ref>Ziegler, pp.198, 238</ref> The Whig Prime Minister, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], had Lord Howe removed from Adelaide's household. Attempts to reinstate him after the Reform Bill had passed were not successful, as Lord Grey and Lord Howe could not come to an agreement as to how independent Howe could be of the government.<ref>Ziegler, pp.237\u2013238</ref>\n\nIn October 1834, a great fire destroyed much of the [[Palace of Westminster]], which Adelaide considered divine retribution for the vagaries of reform.<ref>Ziegler, p.250</ref> When the Whig ministry of [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] was dismissed by the King, ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper blamed the Queen's influence, though she seems to have had very little to do with it.<ref>Ziegler, pp.256\u2013257 and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], quoted in Allen, p.179</ref> Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]], she did write to the King against reform of the [[Church of Ireland]].<ref>[[Herbert Taylor (British Army officer)|Sir Herbert Taylor]], the King's secretary, writing to [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], 15 July 1835, quoted in Ziegler, p.276</ref>\n\nBoth William and Adelaide were fond of their niece, Princess Victoria of Kent, and wanted her to be closer to them. Their efforts were frustrated by Victoria's mother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]]. The Duchess refused to acknowledge Adelaide's precedence, left letters from Adelaide unanswered and commandeered space in the royal stables and apartments for her own use. The King, aggrieved at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, bluntly announced in the presence of Adelaide, the Duchess, Victoria and many guests, that the Duchess was \"incompetent to act with propriety\", that he had been \"grossly and continually insulted by that person\", and that he hoped to have the satisfaction of living beyond Victoria's age of majority, so that the Duchess of Kent would never be Regent. Everyone was aghast at the vehemence of the speech, and all three ladies were deeply upset.<ref>Allen, pp.223\u2013224</ref> The breach between the Duchess and the King and Queen was never fully healed, but Victoria always viewed both of them with kindness.<ref>Allen, p.225</ref>\n\n==Queen dowager==\n[[File:QueenAdelaide.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Portrait of Queen Adelaide painted by [[Martin Archer Shee|Sir Martin Archer Shee]] in 1836.]]\nQueen Adelaide was dangerously ill in April 1837, at around the same time that she was present at her mother's deathbed in Meiningen, but she recovered.<ref>Ziegler, p.286</ref> By June, it became evident that the King was fatally ill himself. Adelaide stayed beside William's deathbed devotedly, not going to bed herself for more than ten days.<ref>Ziegler, p.289</ref> William IV died from [[congestive heart failure|heart failure]] in the early hours of the morning of 20 June 1837 at [[Windsor Castle]], where he was buried. Victoria was proclaimed as Queen, but subject to the rights of any issue that might be born to Adelaide on the remotely possible chance that she was pregnant.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=19509|page=1581|date=20 June 1837}}</ref>\n\nThe first queen dowager in over a century (Charles II's widow, [[Catherine of Braganza]], had died in 1705, and [[Mary of Modena]], wife of the deposed James II, died in 1718), Adelaide survived her husband by twelve years.\n\nIn early October 1838, for health reasons, Adelaide travelled to [[Malta]] aboard [[HMS Hastings (1819)|HMS ''Hastings'']], stopping at [[Gibraltar]] on the way and staying on the island for three months. Lacking a Protestant church on Malta, the queen dowager paid for the construction of the [[St Paul's Pro-Cathedral, Valletta|St Paul's Pro-Cathedral]] in [[Valletta]]. In the summer of 1844, she paid her last visit to her native country, visiting [[Altenstein Palace]] and Meiningen.<ref>Sandars, p.274-280</ref>\n\nQueen Adelaide had been given the use of [[Marlborough House]], [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] in 1831, and held it until her death in 1849.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40605 |title=Pall Mall, South Side, Past Buildings: Nos 66-68 (consec.)

She became a tenant of [[William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|William Ward]] and took up residence at the latter's newly purchased house, [[Witley Court#The Earls of Dudley|Witley Court]] in [[Worcestershire]], from 1842 until 1846.

The capital city of [[Adelaide]] was named after her at its founding in 1836; the [[Queen Adelaide Club]] for women is still active, and a bronze statue of Queen Adelaide stands in the foyer of the Town Hall. The Queen Adelaide Society was inaugurated in Adelaide in 1981 by the late Dorothy Howie with the twin objectives of promoting public awareness of Queen Adelaide and to provide an annual donation to a South Australian children's charity.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Queen Adelaide Society Inc. |url=http://www.queenadelaidesociety.com |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere is a village named [[Queen Adelaide, Cambridgeshire|Queen Adelaide]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], which takes its name from one of the many public houses named after the queen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Adelaide Village Hall|url=http://www.hallsforhire.org.uk/halls/queen-adelaide-village-hall/}}</ref>\n\nThere are Adelaide Streets, Adelaide Avenues and Adelaide Roads throughout the former empire; there is also  [[Adelaide Hospital (Dublin)|Adelaide Hospital]] (now the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght) in [[Dublin]], and an Adelaide railway station in Belfast.

The Citadel in [[Port Louis]], capital of the Republic of [[Mauritius]], is named Fort Adelaide for her, the building having been started during the reign of William in 1834. In 1832 Adelaide Township was surveyed in what became the western part of Middlesex County in Ontario (now part of the municipality of the Township of [[Adelaide-Metcalfe]]).
