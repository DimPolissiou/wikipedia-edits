A successor state of [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Carolingian Empire|empire]], it was ruled by the [[Carolingian dynasty]] until 911. It was created through the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) which divided the former empire into three kingdoms.{{efn|The term \"[[Francia]]\", land of the Franks, was commonly used to refer to the empire. The ruling dynasty was Frankish, although its inhabitants were mostly other non-Frankish Germanic tribes.}}\n\nThe east\u2013west division, enforced by the [[German language|German]]-[[Latin]] language split, \"gradually hardened into the establishment of separate kingdoms\",<ref>Bradbury 2007, 21: \"... division which gradually hardened into the establishment of separate kingdoms, notably East and West Francia, or what we can begin to call Germany and France.\"</ref> with East Francia becoming the [[Kingdom of Germany]] and [[West Francia]] the [[Kingdom of France]].<ref>Goldberg 2006, 6: \"Louis [the German's] kingship laid the foundations for an east Frankish kingdom that, in the eleventh century, was transformed into the medieval kingdom of Germany\".</ref><ref>Reuter 2006, 270.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Partage de l'Empire carolingien au Trait\u00e9 de Verdun en 843.JPG|thumb|The partition of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. From Histoire Et G\u00e9ographie - Atlas G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vidal-Lablache, 1898.]]\nIn August 843, after three years of civil war following the death of emperor [[Louis the Pious]] on 20 June 840, the [[Treaty of Verdun]] was signed by his three sons and heirs. The division of lands was largely based on the [[Meuse]], [[Scheldt]], [[Saone]] and [[Rhone]] rivers. While the eldest son [[Lothair I]] kept the imperial title and the kingdom of [[Middle Francia]], [[Charles the Bald]] received [[West Francia]] and [[Louis the German]] received the eastern portion of mostly Germanic-speaking lands of [[Duchy of Saxony]], [[Austrasia]], [[Alamannia]], [[Duchy of Bavaria]], and [[March of Carinthia]].\n\nThe contemporary East Frankish ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' describes the kingdom being \"divided in three\" and Louis \"acceding to the eastern part\".<ref>''AF'' a. 843: ''in tres partes diviso ... Hludowicus quidem orientalem partem accepti''.</ref> The West Frankish ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' describe the extent of Louis's lands: \"at the assigning of portions, Louis obtained all the land beyond the Rhine river, but on this side of the Rhine also the cities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz with their counties\".<ref>''AB'' a. 843: ''ubi distributis portionibus, Hludowicus ultra Rhenum omnia, citra Rhenum vero Nemetum, Vangium et Moguntiam civitates pagosque sortitus est''. The cities are [[Speyer]], [[Worms (Germany)|Worms]] and [[Mainz]].</ref> The kingdom of [[West Francia]] went to Louis's younger half-brother [[Charles the Bald]] and between their realms a kingdom of [[Middle Francia]], incorporating [[Regnum Italicum|Italy]], was given to their elder brother, the Emperor [[Lothair I]].\n\nWhile Eastern Francia contained about a third of the traditional Frankish heartland of [[Austrasia]], the rest consisted mostly of lands annexed to the Frankish empire between the fifth and the eighth century.<ref name=\"Goldberg 1999, 41\">Goldberg 1999, 41.</ref> These included the duchies of [[Duchy of Alemannia|Alemannia]], [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]], as well as the northern and eastern marches with the Danes and Slavs. The contemporary chronicler [[Regino of Pr\u00fcm]] wrote that the \"different people\" (''diversae nationes populorum'') of East Francia, mostly Germanic- and Slavic-speaking, could be \"distinguished from each other by race, customs, language and laws\" (''genere moribus lingua legibus'').<ref name=\"Goldberg 1999, 41\"/><ref>Reynolds 1997, 257.</ref>\n\nIn 869 [[Lotharingia]] was divided between West and East Francia under the [[Treaty of Meersen]]. The short lived Middle Francia turned out to be the theatre of Franco-German wars up until the 20th century.\n\nAll the Frankish lands were briefly reunited by [[Charles the Fat]], but in 888 he was deposed by nobles and in East Francia [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] was elected king.\n\nThe increasing weakness of royal power in East Francia meant that dukes of Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia, Saxony and Lotharingia turned from appointed nobles into hereditary rulers of their territories. Kings increasingly had to deal with regional rebellions.\n\nIn 911 Saxon, Franconian, Bavarian and Swabian nobles no longer followed the tradition of electing someone from the Carolingian dynasty as a king to rule over them and on 10 November, 911 elected one of their own as the new king. Because [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad I]] was one of the dukes, he found it very hard to establish his authority over them. Duke [[Henry the Fowler|Henry of Saxony]] was in rebellion against Conrad I until 915 and struggle against [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]] cost Conrad I his life. On his deathbed Conrad I chose Henry of Saxony as the most capable successor. This kingship changed from Franks to Saxons, who had suffered greatly during the conquests of Charlemagne. Henry, who was elected to kingship by only Saxons and Franconians at [[Fritzlar]], had to subdue other dukes and concentrated on creating a state apparatus which was fully utilized by his son and successor [[Otto I]]. By his death in July 936 Henry had prevented collapse of royal power as was happening in [[West Francia]] and left a much stronger kingdom to his successor [[Otto I]]. After Otto I was crowned as the Emperor in Rome in 962 the era of the Holy Roman Empire began.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term ''orientalis Francia'' originally referred to [[Franconia]] and ''orientales Franci'' to its inhabitants, the ethnic [[Franks]] living east of the Rhine. The use of the term in a broader sense, to refer to the eastern kingdom, was an innovation of Louis the German's court. Since eastern Francia could be identified with old [[Austrasia]], the Frankish heartland, Louis's choice of terminology hints at his ambitions.<ref>Goldberg 2006, 73.</ref> Under his grandson, [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], the terminology was largely dropped and the kingdom, when it was referred to by name, was simply ''Francia''.<ref>M\u00fcller-Mertens 1999, 237.</ref>\n\nWhen it was necessary, as in the [[Treaty of Bonn]] (921) with the West Franks, the \"eastern\" qualifier appeared. [[Henry I of Germany|Henry I]] refers to himself as ''rex Francorum orientalium'', \"king of the East Franks\", in the treaty.<ref>M\u00fcller-Mertens 1999, 241.</ref> By the 12th century, the historian [[Otto of Freising]], in using the Carolingian terminology, had to explain that the \"eastern kingdom of the Franks\" (''orientale Francorum regnum'') was \"now called the kingdom of the Germans\" (''regnum Teutonicorum'').<ref>Scales 2012, 158.</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nThe regalia of the Carolingian empire had been divided by Louis the Pious on his deathbed between his two faithful sons, Charles the Bald and Lothair. Louis the German, then in rebellion, received nothing of the crown jewels or liturgical books associated with Carolingian kingship. Thus the symbols and rituals of East Frankish kingship were created from scratch.<ref>Goldberg 1999, 43.</ref>\n\nFrom an early date the East Frankish kingdom had a more formalised notion of royal election than West Francia. Around 900, a liturgy (''ordo'') for the coronation of a king, called the early German ''ordo'', was written for a private audience. It required the coronator to ask the \"designated prince\" (''princeps designatus'') whether he was willing to defend the church and the people and then to turn and ask the people whether they were willing to be subject to the prince and obey his laws. The latter then shouted, \"''Fiat'', ''fiat''!\" (Let it be done!), an act that later became known as \"Recognition\". This is the earliest known coronation ''ordo'' with a Recognition in it, and it was subsequently incorporated in the influential [[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum]].<ref>Ullmann 1969, 108\u201309.</ref>\n\nIn June 888, King [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]] convened a council at [[Mainz]]. In attendance were the three archbishops of the East Frankish kingdom\u2014[[Wilbert of Cologne]], [[Liutbert of Mainz]] and [[Ratbod of Trier]]\u2014and the West Frankish archbishops of Reims ([[Fulk (archbishop of Reims)|Fulk]]) and Rouen (John I) along with the bishops of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais|Beauvais]] and [[Ancient Diocese of Noyon|Noyon]]. According to [[Walter Ullmann]], the presence of the West Franks was on account of the \"barren ecclesiastical thought\" of the East, and the council proceeded to adopt West Frankish ideas of royal sacrality and [[anointing]]. It was \"the first phase in the process of assimilation of the two halves of the Carolingian inheritance\".<ref name=\"Ullmann 1969, 124\u201327\">Ullmann 1969, 124\u201327.</ref> In another church council at [[Tribur]] in 895, the prelates declared that Arnulf was chosen by God and not by men and Arnulf in turn swore to defend the church and its privileges from all its enemies. When Arnulf died in 899, his minor son, [[Louis the Child|Louis IV]], was crowned, but not anointed, and placed under the tutelage of Archbishop [[Hatto I (archbishop of Mainz)|Hatto I of Mainz]]. Louis's coronation was the first in German history. When Louis died in late September 911, Duke [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad of Franconia]] was elected to replace him on 10 November and he became the first German king to receive unction.<ref name=\"Ullmann 1969, 124\u201327\"/>\n\n==Church==\nThe three basic services monasteries could owe to the sovereign in the Frankish realms were military service, an annual donation of money or work, and prayers for the royal family and the kingdom. Collectively, these were known by the technical term ''servitium regis'' (\"king's service\").<ref>Bernhardt 1993, 77.</ref> According to the evidence of the ''[[Notitia de servitio monasteriorum]]'', a list of monasteries and the services they owed drawn up around 817, the burden of military and monetary service was more severe in west Francia than in east Francia. Only four monasteries listed as \"beyond the Rhine\" (''ultra Rhenum'') owed these services: [[Lorsch Abbey|Lorsch]], [[Schuttern Abbey|Schuttern]], [[Mondsee Abbey|Mondsee]] and [[Tegernsee Abbey|Tegernsee]].<ref>Bernhardt 1993, 112 and n. 116.</ref>\n\n==List of kings==\n*[[Louis the German]] (843\u2013876)\n*[[Louis the Younger]] (876\u2013882)\n*[[Charles the Fat]] (882\u2013887)\n*[[Arnulf of Carinthia]] (887\u2013899)\n*[[Louis the Child]] (900\u2013911)\n*[[Conrad I of Germany]] (911\u2013918)\n*[[Henry the Fowler]] (919\u2013936)\n*[[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] (936\u2013973)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Frankish kings]]\n*[[List of German monarchs]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Bernard Bachrach]] and [[David Bachrach]]. \"The Saxon Military Revolution, 912\u2013973: Myth and Reality\".

A successor state of [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Carolingian Empire|empire]], it was ruled by the [[Carolingian dynasty]] until 911. It was created through the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) which divided the former empire into three kingdoms.{{efn|The term \"[[Francia]]\", land of the Franks, was commonly used to refer to the empire. The ruling dynasty was Frankish, although its inhabitants were mostly other non-Frankish Germanic tribes.}}\n\nThe east\u2013west division, enforced by the [[German language|German]]-[[Latin]] language split, \"gradually hardened into the establishment of separate kingdoms\",<ref>Bradbury 2007, 21: \"... division which gradually hardened into the establishment of separate kingdoms, notably East and West Francia, or what we can begin to call Germany and France.\"</ref> with East Francia becoming the [[Kingdom of Germany]] and [[West Francia]] the [[Kingdom of France]].<ref>Goldberg 2006, 6: \"Louis [the German's] kingship laid the foundations for an east Frankish kingdom that, in the eleventh century, was transformed into the medieval kingdom of Germany\".</ref><ref>Reuter 2006, 270.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Partage de l'Empire carolingien au Trait\u00e9 de Verdun en 843.JPG|thumb|The partition of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. From Histoire Et G\u00e9ographie - Atlas G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vidal-Lablache, 1898.]]\nIn August 843, after three years of civil war following the death of emperor [[Louis the Pious]] on 20 June 840, the [[Treaty of Verdun]] was signed by his three sons and heirs. The division of lands was largely based on the [[Meuse]], [[Scheldt]], [[Saone]] and [[Rhone]] rivers. While the eldest son [[Lothair I]] kept the imperial title and the kingdom of [[Middle Francia]], [[Charles the Bald]] received [[West Francia]] and [[Louis the German]] received the eastern portion of mostly Germanic-speaking lands of [[Duchy of Saxony]], [[Austrasia]], [[Alamannia]], [[Duchy of Bavaria]], and [[March of Carinthia]].\n\nThe contemporary East Frankish ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' describes the kingdom being \"divided in three\" and Louis \"acceding to the eastern part\".<ref>''AF'' a. 843: ''in tres partes diviso ... Hludowicus quidem orientalem partem accepti''.</ref> The West Frankish ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' describe the extent of Louis's lands: \"at the assigning of portions, Louis obtained all the land beyond the Rhine river, but on this side of the Rhine also the cities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz with their counties\".<ref>''AB'' a. 843: ''ubi distributis portionibus, Hludowicus ultra Rhenum omnia, citra Rhenum vero Nemetum, Vangium et Moguntiam civitates pagosque sortitus est''. The cities are [[Speyer]], [[Worms (Germany)|Worms]] and [[Mainz]].</ref> The kingdom of [[West Francia]] went to Louis's younger half-brother [[Charles the Bald]] and between their realms a kingdom of [[Middle Francia]], incorporating [[Regnum Italicum|Italy]], was given to their elder brother, the Emperor [[Lothair I]].\n\nWhile Eastern Francia contained about a third of the traditional Frankish heartland of [[Austrasia]], the rest consisted mostly of lands annexed to the Frankish empire between the fifth and the eighth century.<ref name=\"Goldberg 1999, 41\">Goldberg 1999, 41.</ref> These included the duchies of [[Duchy of Alemannia|Alemannia]], [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]], as well as the northern and eastern marches with the Danes and Slavs. The contemporary chronicler [[Regino of Pr\u00fcm]] wrote that the \"different people\" (''diversae nationes populorum'') of East Francia, mostly Germanic- and Slavic-speaking, could be \"distinguished from each other by race, customs, language and laws\" (''genere moribus lingua legibus'').<ref name=\"Goldberg 1999, 41\"/><ref>Reynolds 1997, 257.</ref>\n\nIn 869 [[Lotharingia]] was divided between West and East Francia under the [[Treaty of Meersen]]. The short lived Middle Francia turned out to be the theatre of Franco-German wars up until the 20th century.\n\nAll the Frankish lands were briefly reunited by [[Charles the Fat]], but in 888 he was deposed by nobles and in East Francia [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] was elected king.\n\nThe increasing weakness of royal power in East Francia meant that dukes of Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia, Saxony and Lotharingia turned from appointed nobles into hereditary rulers of their territories. Kings increasingly had to deal with regional rebellions.\n\nIn 911 Saxon, Franconian, Bavarian and Swabian nobles no longer followed the tradition of electing someone from the Carolingian dynasty as a king to rule over them and on 10 November, 911 elected one of their own as the new king. Because [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad I]] was one of the dukes, he found it very hard to establish his authority over them. Duke [[Henry the Fowler|Henry of Saxony]] was in rebellion against Conrad I until 915 and struggle against [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]] cost Conrad I his life. On his deathbed Conrad I chose Henry of Saxony as the most capable successor. This kingship changed from Franks to Saxons, who had suffered greatly during the conquests of Charlemagne. Henry, who was elected to kingship by only Saxons and Franconians at [[Fritzlar]], had to subdue other dukes and concentrated on creating a state apparatus which was fully utilized by his son and successor [[Otto I]]. By his death in July 936 Henry had prevented collapse of royal power as was happening in [[West Francia]] and left a much stronger kingdom to his successor [[Otto I]]. After Otto I was crowned as the Emperor in Rome in 962 the era of the Holy Roman Empire began.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term ''orientalis Francia'' originally referred to [[Franconia]] and ''orientales Franci'' to its inhabitants, the ethnic [[Franks]] living east of the Rhine. The use of the term in a broader sense, to refer to the eastern kingdom, was an innovation of Louis the German's court. Since eastern Francia could be identified with old [[Austrasia]], the Frankish heartland, Louis's choice of terminology hints at his ambitions.<ref>Goldberg 2006, 73.</ref> Under his grandson, [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], the terminology was largely dropped and the kingdom, when it was referred to by name, was simply ''Francia''.<ref>M\u00fcller-Mertens 1999, 237.</ref>\n\nWhen it was necessary, as in the [[Treaty of Bonn]] (921) with the West Franks, the \"eastern\" qualifier appeared. [[Henry I of Germany|Henry I]] refers to himself as ''rex Francorum orientalium'', \"king of the East Franks\", in the treaty.<ref>M\u00fcller-Mertens 1999, 241.</ref> By the 12th century, the historian [[Otto of Freising]], in using the Carolingian terminology, had to explain that the \"eastern kingdom of the Franks\" (''orientale Francorum regnum'') was \"now called the kingdom of the Germans\" (''regnum Teutonicorum'').<ref>Scales 2012, 158.</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nThe regalia of the Carolingian empire had been divided by Louis the Pious on his deathbed between his two faithful sons, Charles the Bald and Lothair. Louis the German, then in rebellion, received nothing of the crown jewels or liturgical books associated with Carolingian kingship. Thus the symbols and rituals of East Frankish kingship were created from scratch.<ref>Goldberg 1999, 43.</ref>\n\nFrom an early date the East Frankish kingdom had a more formalised notion of royal election than West Francia. Around 900, a liturgy (''ordo'') for the coronation of a king, called the early German ''ordo'', was written for a private audience. It required the coronator to ask the \"designated prince\" (''princeps designatus'') whether he was willing to defend the church and the people and then to turn and ask the people whether they were willing to be subject to the prince and obey his laws. The latter then shouted, \"''Fiat'', ''fiat''!\" (Let it be done!), an act that later became known as \"Recognition\". This is the earliest known coronation ''ordo'' with a Recognition in it, and it was subsequently incorporated in the influential [[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum]].<ref>Ullmann 1969, 108\u201309.</ref>\n\nIn June 888, King [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]] convened a council at [[Mainz]]. In attendance were the three archbishops of the East Frankish kingdom\u2014[[Wilbert of Cologne]], [[Liutbert of Mainz]] and [[Ratbod of Trier]]\u2014and the West Frankish archbishops of Reims ([[Fulk (archbishop of Reims)|Fulk]]) and Rouen (John I) along with the bishops of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais|Beauvais]] and [[Ancient Diocese of Noyon|Noyon]]. According to [[Walter Ullmann]], the presence of the West Franks was on account of the \"barren ecclesiastical thought\" of the East, and the council proceeded to adopt West Frankish ideas of royal sacrality and [[anointing]]. It was \"the first phase in the process of assimilation of the two halves of the Carolingian inheritance\".<ref name=\"Ullmann 1969, 124\u201327\">Ullmann 1969, 124\u201327.</ref> In another church council at [[Tribur]] in 895, the prelates declared that Arnulf was chosen by God and not by men and Arnulf in turn swore to defend the church and its privileges from all its enemies. When Arnulf died in 899, his minor son, [[Louis the Child|Louis IV]], was crowned, but not anointed, and placed under the tutelage of Archbishop [[Hatto I (archbishop of Mainz)|Hatto I of Mainz]]. Louis's coronation was the first in German history. When Louis died in late September 911, Duke [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad of Franconia]] was elected to replace him on 10 November and he became the first German king to receive unction.<ref name=\"Ullmann 1969, 124\u201327\"/>\n\n==Church==\nThe three basic services monasteries could owe to the sovereign in the Frankish realms were military service, an annual donation of money or work, and prayers for the royal family and the kingdom. Collectively, these were known by the technical term ''servitium regis'' (\"king's service\").<ref>Bernhardt 1993, 77.</ref> According to the evidence of the ''[[Notitia de servitio monasteriorum]]'', list of monasteries and the services they owed drawn up around 817, the burden of military and monetary service was more severe in west Francia than in east Francia. Only four monasteries listed as \"beyond the Rhine\" (''ultra Rhenum'') owed these services: [[Lorsch Abbey|Lorsch]], [[Schuttern Abbey|Schuttern]], [[Mondsee Abbey|Mondsee]] and [[Tegernsee Abbey|Tegernsee]].<ref>Bernhardt 1993, 112 and n. 116.</ref>\n\n==List of kings==\n*[[Louis the German]] (843\u2013876)\n*[[Louis the Younger]] (876\u2013882)\n*[[Charles the Fat]] (882\u2013887)\n*[[Arnulf of Carinthia]] (887\u2013899)\n*[[Louis the Child]] (900\u2013911)\n*[[Conrad I of Germany]] (911\u2013918)\n*[[Henry the Fowler]] (919\u2013936)\n*[[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] (936\u2013973)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Frankish kings]]\n*[[List of German monarchs]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Bernard Bachrach]] and [[David Bachrach]]. \"The Saxon Military Revolution, 912\u2013973: Myth and Reality\".

Georgia also views a large-scale foreign invasion and the spillover of conflicts from Russia\u2019s [[North Caucasus]] as the worst potential near- and long-term scenarios, respectively.<ref>The Strategic Defense Review (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 2008 the Georgian military conducted an operation in Georgia's breakaway region [[South Ossetia]] (see [[2008 South Ossetia War]]). The operation led to an armed conflict with forces from the [[Russian Federation]] and resulted in the defeat and expulsion of Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following the military operations, Russia recognized independence of the regions, declared a decade ago.\n\nThe military budget of Georgia increased more than 50 times over the period from 2002 (US$18 mln.) to 2007 (US$780 mln.), reaching over 7% of Georgia's GDP.

Much of the captured equipment that was not subsequently destroyed got transferred to Russia or given to the separatists. Parts of Georgia's relatively modern artillery and anti-aircraft units were captured and later destroyed. Russian forces sank four Georgian naval vessels in the port of Poti, a coast guard gunboat in a naval skirmish, and hauled away nine rigid-hull inflatable boats. The Georgian Air Force lost two [[L-29]] jet trainers, one [[AN-2]] airplane, and four helicopters, all destroyed on the ground. Despite these mostly non combat losses, President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] claimed that Georgia had lost less than 5% of its military hardware, contradicting figures from the Georgian military itself.<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/5jZjEpcOy?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=33974</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n\nGeorgia immediately began a process of re-armament after the war.

NATO officially announced the complete support of the country's efforts in establishing the efficient military force that is required to defend the country against any regional threats and agreed on delivering high end sophisticated defense capabilities and boosting the overall quality of the GAF. The package also includes a group of NATO experts monitoring the process in order to control and ensure its successful implementation for the given time period. Further a large training center for joint military drills will be constructed. NATO did not state that it would directly arm the GAF but fully assist in acquiring requested military hardware and that it would lift the general arms embargo on Georgia that was in effect since 2008. After the last major conflict with Russia, Georgia repeatedly was denied the delivery of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons and other heavy equipment despite heavy shortage on said weapons and numerous demands and harsh criticism from both the former and current ruling parties.\n\nAlmost immediately after the summit US defense secretary Chuck Hagel announced during his visit to Georgia that the US will start providing long requested UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters which is an arrangement reportedly outside the NATO package. Russia reacted very critical to the plan of building an international training center in Georgia claiming it would bring instability to the region. The statement was denied by NATO reminding that Georgia is a [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]] member and already provides similar capabilities such as an alpine warfare school for NATO and partner nations.<ref>http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_38988.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/u-s-to-strengthen-its-military-cooperation-with-georgia-34788|title=U.S. to strengthen its military cooperation with Georgia|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-enlargement/nato-to-draw-up-measures-to-bring-georgia-closer-to-alliance-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625|title=NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/20406/eng|title=NATO chief details package to \"bring Georgia closer\" to Alliance|website=agenda.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.2758750|title=CBC News - U.S., Georgia strengthen defence ties over Russian aggression|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-georgia-nato-idUKKCN0I60SB20141017|title=Defying Russia, Georgia to host NATO training centre - minister|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27100|title=Civil.Ge - NATO, Georgian FMs Hold Meeting|first=Civil|last=Georgia|website=www.civil.ge}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative to MAP ===\nDespite knowing that there would not be any newcomers announced during the Wales summit, the Georgian government was confident that their country would at least receive the Membership Action Plan, which is the primary precondition for aspirant nations to become NATO member.

The aim was to create two independently acting military districts which would consist of forces in accordance to the strategic value of their deployment areas yet being balanced in their type of equipment. In case of war each group will be able to coordinate its operations independently from high command, having its own logistical and administrative reserves.\n\n===Special Operations Forces===\n{{main article|Georgian Special Operations Forces}}\n\nThe Special Operations Forces of the Defence Forces of Georgia were established to conduct unconventional warfare and the full spectrum of special operation missions. They also serve in supporting capacity for regular military forces, primarily in the areas of education and training.\n\nTheir structure is as follows:\n\n*Finance and Accounting Service\n*Headquarters\n*[[File:Special Forces Group.png|31px]] Special Operations Forces\n** Special Operations Battalion East\n** Special Operations Battalion West \n*[[File:Special Forces School PNG.png|31px]] Special Operations Training Center named after Major Gela Chedia\n*Staff Company\n\nGeorgian special forces became first active in 1999 as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]. Georgian commandos participated in the [[Iraq War]] from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an [[2008 South Ossetia War|escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia]]. According to independent accounts, a number of Georgian operatives were also deployed prior in Afghanistan to aide US Special Forces in hunting down [[Taliban]] leaders. Georgian officials have stated that a group of servicemen were deployed in Afghanistan for medical purposes.\n\n=== Army Air Section (former Air Force) ===\n[[File:Su-25ub.JPG|thumb|Georgian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground attack aircraft]]\n{{main article|Georgian Air Force}}\nThe Strategic Defence Review in 2007 described the Air Force consists of aviation and air defence assets and provides security to Georgia\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe Georgian Air Force was merged into the Army in 2010, and was renamed the Army Air Section, undergoing massive reorganization and restructuring. The additional operative section of the [[Georgian Land Forces]] currently consists of an unknown amount of planes, transport helicopters, gunships and 3,000 personnel. The Georgian Air Force lost two helicopters and a number of transport and trainer aircraft on ground during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]],\n\nTwo major airfields are located near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Alekseevka, Georgia|Alekseevka]] and [[Marneuli]].\n\n=== Georgian Coast Guard (Former Naval Force) ===\n{{main article|Georgian Navy}}\nIn 2007 the Strategic Defence Review said the Georgian Navy protects Georgia\u2019s territorial waters and contributes to the collective maritime defence in the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Georgian Navy was abolished in 2009 and was incorporated into the Coast Guard, which is not structurally part of the Defense Forces, but rather it is a subunit of the Border Guard of Georgia, which is under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  The [[Coast Guard of Georgia]] is responsible for maintenance of the sovereignty of the country and for protection of internal territorial waters and economic zones. The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Poti]].\n\n[[File:Georgian coast guard in the port of Batumi.jpg|thumb|Georgian [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] vessels]]\nThe other, smaller Coast Guard base is in [[Batumi]]. Besides the naval force, the navy also includes a Special Counter-terrorist Detachment force. Georgia is also one of the founding members and a participant of the [[Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group]]. Before the war with Russia, the Georgian navy had 19 naval vessels. 4 of them were sunk during the conflict, and nine rigid-hull inflatables were captured by Russia. The Georgians raised and returned to service two of the sunken vessels, and partially replaced their losses with Turkish-built patrol/fast attack boats. Their heaviest armaments are 25\u221230mm cannons. However, no Georgian navy vessels are armed with ship-to-ship missiles.\n\n=== National Guard of Georgia ===\nThe [[National Guard of Georgia]] was established on December 20, 1990 and was manned mainly by volunteers. It represents the first Georgian armed formation, which became the base of the foundation for modern Defense Forces of Georgia. The Guard actively participated in the conflicts that occurred in Georgian territory (Samachablo, Abkhazia).\n\nThe National Guard used to consist of 20,554 personnel, but has now been reduced to 550. The main missions of the National Guard are:\n\n#Support civil government in crisis situations (natural, technological, ecological);\n#Register mobilization resources, study and deliver;\n#Convene, select and man of citizens on the basis of the agreement, for the units, subunits and bases of the Defense Forces;\n#Provide ceremonial activity support;\n#Assisting in training the Reserve Forces.\n\n=== Army Reserve and Territorial Defence Forces ===\n\nThe Army Reserve is a professional reserve force consisting of former regular army personnel only. Due to the amount of experience, the Reserve personnel would be set-in for replacement of losses in the ranks of regular formations and will if needed also operate in the vanguard of a combined mechanized group or an infantry assault.\n\nThe Territorial Defence Forces were established for immediate readiness of the population in crisis events, such as war. Its main goals would be the fortification and defence of all populated and strategically important areas as well as providing quick aid or security for evacuation operations in case of natural catastrophes.\n\nOther than the active army reserve which consists of only ex military personnel, the Territorial Defence Forces are rather sparsely prepared for complex military operations. It instead provides more comfort for the regular forces in case of war. By acting as additional logistical arm and leaving the actual combat to them. With the land forces and reserve army engaged in direct action the Defence Force's most important task would be to construct trenches, bunkers and obstacles around strategically important areas and position themselves on systematically formed defensive lines. The number of conscripts does not exceed 140,000 and is reasonably large, as it is in the strategy's intention to use any possible geographical advantage over the enemy, when professionalism is compensated by that factor.\n\nThe TDF reservist is comparably poorly equipped for modern warfare. The number of combat, protection gear and supplies will be most likely limited in the event of war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare. The weapons trained on are mainly of soviet origin and abandoned material used formerly by the regular land forces, including tanks. Such weapons are the AK series assault rifles and the [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled launchers.\n\n=== Commissioned officers ===\n{{Main article|Officer (armed forces)}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|}\n\n== International cooperation ==\n[[File:Georgian Army - Operations abroad since 1991.png|thumb|Operations abroad since 1991.]]\n[[File:GeorgianArmy.jpg|thumb|Georgian troops listening to a speech in Baghdad, Iraq]]\n\nThe Defense Forces have been participating in peacekeeping missions (the [[Balkans]], [[Persian Gulf]]) since 1999.\n\nUnits participating in peacekeeping missions are manned by professional soldiers, the duration of the mission is six months and participation is voluntary. The readiness assessment criteria are, as follows: health condition, physical fitness, professional skills and experience.\n\n=== Peacekeeping missions ===\n[[File:U.S. Marines and Georgian Army soldiers conduct operation Northern Lion II, Part I 130703-M-YH552-0074.jpg|thumb|right|Georgian soldiers during Operation Northern Lion II, Afghanistan]]\n{{Main article|Role of Georgia in the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Role of Georgia in the Iraq War}}\n\nAbout 200 Georgian troops were deployed in the Kosovo ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) in 1999\u20132008, 70 were deployed in Iraq ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]]) in 2003 and 50 in Afghanistan in 2004 ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]). From 2004 in Iraq were 300 Georgian troops. From 2005 approximately 850 troops were serving under Coalition Command ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] and [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq|UNAMI]]). On July 2007 Georgia sent an extra 1,400 troops to [[Iraq]]; that brought the total number of troops in Iraq to 2,000. About 300 of these troops were assigned to Taskforce Petro and stationed at COP Cleary outside the town of Wahida near Salman Pak, Iraq. On August 8, 2008 Georgia announced it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq due to rising hostilities with Russia. Their preparedness and training skills are evaluated on highest level by international experts. The entire Iraq contingent has been airlifted back to Georgia.\n\nHence, owing to participation in international [[peacekeeping]] missions the military members are able to obtain practical experience and to show readiness to cooperate with [[NATO]] and with other partner countries' forces.\n\nCurrently there are more than 1,570 Georgian combat troops  deployed in [[Helmand]], [[Afghanistan]] where Georgia has thus far suffered 22 deaths and over a hundred injuries.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23895 Tenth Georgia Soldier Killed in Afghanistan] Retrieved: September 1, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Seth Robson |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-training-a-dual-mission-for-georgians-1.136920 |title=U.S. training a dual mission for Georgians |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> In September 2012, Georgia stated that it would continue its contributions in Afghanistan following the 2014 NATO withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2012_new_army_military_defence_industry/georgia_will_continue_its_contribution_for_nato_mission_in_afghanistan_in_post-2014_period_1009122.html Georgia keeps helping Afghanistan] - Armyrecognition.com, September 10, 2012</ref>\nIn November 2012, Georgia had doubled the number of troops deployed to fight with Nato-led forces in Afghanistan to over 1,500.

More recent developments however have their roots in the Soviet Union. In 1941 Georgia became one of the most important Soviet weapon manufacturing countries during the [[Second World War]]. It was responsible for providing the Soviet Army with all types of aircraft and ammunition. [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]]'s role didn't change after the war. Up until 1990 Georgia was producing various types of fighter aircraft, most notably the [[Su-25]] since it was produced almost exclusively in Georgia, unmanned areal vehicles, missiles, satellite components and orbital satellites. The company lost most of its functionality and production capability when the Soviet Union dissolved, yet was not abandoned. In the late 1990s Georgia's JSC RMP and later the newly established Ministry of Defence section [[STC DELTA|DELTA]] started to work on the development of ballistic equipment using their own ingredients. The advanced research unit had successfully developed a variety of personal protection gear, such as bomb disposal suits and level I-IV body armour using classified mixtures of domestic resource. These projects never went beyond some prototypes, mainly due to poor attention and financing from the government.\n\nWith foreign support primarily from the United States since 2005, Georgia became able to start building a solid industrial base for the military. From 2001 to 2007, Delta experimented with unmanned aerial vehicles and modified parts for helicopters and Su-25 aircraft until it got involved in the modification of Georgia's T-72 tank fleet. In 2009-10, with enough experience and expertise and the assistance of designer [[Zviad Tsikolia]], Delta created its first prototype of an armored personnel carrier, the [[Didgori Armoured Personnel Carrier|Didgori]]. Early tests were highly successful so that its first production line started already in 2011.  Two versions would initially serve in the armed forces in 2012, followed by different modifications from 2013 on. The [[Lazika]] is Delta's attempt to manufacture a suitable modular infantry fighting vehicle created for multiple tasks. While still under development, some Lazikas are already in active service. Delta considers the Lazika as one of the best vehicles of its class bearing armour technology similar to that of Israel. The remotely operated systems are locally produced as well. Due to \"misdirected financing\" and heavy interfering of former government officials, project Lazika was temporarily cancelled in late 2012, also due to \"sabotage\" and shortcomings in its armour research, but then later continued in early 2013 when a newly elected government took charge. \n\nAs of 2007 Georgia has been domestically producing uniforms for its military personnel. Early products were of poor quality, and such shortcomings were only corrected beginning in 2012. Since then only high quality fabrics are licensed for use. Other main production lines include various types of artillery systems such as [[MLRS]], mortars and corresponding ammunition, anti-tank weapons and devices, full uniform sets for ceremonies and for all service branches, including boots, hats, assault vests, pouches, and backpacks. New kind of ballistic vests and helmets have been developed and produced for military service since 2013. The Georgian production uses techniques based on know-how from aerospace research whose methods differ slightly yet significantly from foreign ones.

Georgia also views a large-scale foreign invasion and the spillover of conflicts from Russia\u2019s [[North Caucasus]] as the worst potential near- and long-term scenarios, respectively.<ref>The Strategic Defense Review (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 2008 the Georgian military conducted an operation in Georgia's breakaway region [[South Ossetia]] (see [[2008 South Ossetia War]]). The operation led to an armed conflict with forces from the [[Russian Federation]] and resulted in the defeat and expulsion of Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following the military operations, Russia recognized independence of the regions, declared a decade ago.\n\nThe military budget of Georgia increased more than 50 times over the period from 2002 (US$18 mln.) to 2007 (US$780 mln.), reaching over 7% of Georgia's GDP.

Much of the captured equipment that was not subsequently destroyed got transferred to Russia or given to the separatists. Parts of Georgia's relatively modern artillery and anti-aircraft units were captured and later destroyed. Russian forces sank four Georgian naval vessels in the port of Poti, a coast guard gunboat in a naval skirmish, and hauled away nine rigid-hull inflatable boats. The Georgian Air Force lost two [[L-29]] jet trainers, one [[AN-2]] airplane, and four helicopters, all destroyed on the ground. Despite these mostly non combat losses, President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] claimed that Georgia had lost less than 5% of its military hardware, contradicting figures from the Georgian military itself.<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/5jZjEpcOy?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=33974</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n\nGeorgia immediately began a process of re-armament after the war.

NATO officially announced the complete support of the country's efforts in establishing the efficient military force that is required to defend the country against any regional threats and agreed on delivering high end sophisticated defense capabilities and boosting the overall quality of the GAF. The package also includes a group of NATO experts monitoring the process in order to control and ensure its successful implementation for the given time period. Further a large training center for joint military drills will be constructed. NATO did not state that it would directly arm the GAF but fully assist in acquiring requested military hardware and that it would lift the general arms embargo on Georgia that was in effect since 2008. After the last major conflict with Russia, Georgia repeatedly was denied the delivery of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons and other heavy equipment despite heavy shortage on said weapons and numerous demands and harsh criticism from both the former and current ruling parties.\n\nAlmost immediately after the summit US defense secretary Chuck Hagel announced during his visit to Georgia that the US will start providing long requested UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters which is an arrangement reportedly outside the NATO package. Russia reacted very critical to the plan of building an international training center in Georgia claiming it would bring instability to the region. The statement was denied by NATO reminding that Georgia is a [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]] member and already provides similar capabilities such as an alpine warfare school for NATO and partner nations.<ref>http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_38988.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/u-s-to-strengthen-its-military-cooperation-with-georgia-34788|title=U.S. to strengthen its military cooperation with Georgia|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-enlargement/nato-to-draw-up-measures-to-bring-georgia-closer-to-alliance-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625|title=NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/20406/eng|title=NATO chief details package to \"bring Georgia closer\" to Alliance|website=agenda.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.2758750|title=CBC News - U.S., Georgia strengthen defence ties over Russian aggression|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-georgia-nato-idUKKCN0I60SB20141017|title=Defying Russia, Georgia to host NATO training centre - minister|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27100|title=Civil.Ge - NATO, Georgian FMs Hold Meeting|first=Civil|last=Georgia|website=www.civil.ge}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative to MAP ===\nDespite knowing that there would not be any newcomers announced during the Wales summit, the Georgian government was confident that their country would at least receive the Membership Action Plan, which is the primary precondition for aspirant nations to become NATO member.

The aim was to create two independently acting military districts which would consist of forces in accordance to the strategic value of their deployment areas yet being balanced in their type of equipment. In case of war each group will be able to coordinate its operations independently from high command, having its own logistical and administrative reserves.\n\n===Special Operations Forces===\n{{main article|Georgian Special Operations Forces}}\n\nThe Special Operations Forces of the Defence Forces of Georgia were established to conduct unconventional warfare and the full spectrum of special operation missions. They also serve in supporting capacity for regular military forces, primarily in the areas of education and training.\n\nTheir structure is as follows:\n\n*Finance and Accounting Service\n*Headquarters\n*[[File:Special Forces Group.png|31px]] Special Operations Forces\n** Special Operations Battalion East\n** Special Operations Battalion West \n*[[File:Special Forces School PNG.png|31px]] Special Operations Training Center named after Major Gela Chedia\n*Staff Company\n\nGeorgian special forces became first active in 1999 as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]. Georgian commandos participated in the [[Iraq War]] from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an [[2008 South Ossetia War|escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia]]. According to independent accounts, a number of Georgian operatives were also deployed prior in Afghanistan to aide US Special Forces in hunting down [[Taliban]] leaders. Georgian officials have stated that a group of servicemen were deployed in Afghanistan for medical purposes.\n\n=== Army Air Section (former Air Force) ===\n[[File:Su-25ub.JPG|thumb|Georgian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground attack aircraft]]\n{{main article|Georgian Air Force}}\nThe Strategic Defence Review in 2007 described the Air Force consists of aviation and air defence assets and provides security to Georgia\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe Georgian Air Force was merged into the Army in 2010, and was renamed the Army Air Section, undergoing massive reorganization and restructuring. The additional operative section of the [[Georgian Land Forces]] currently consists of an unknown amount of planes, transport helicopters, gunships and 3,000 personnel. The Georgian Air Force lost two helicopters and a number of transport and trainer aircraft on ground during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]],\n\nTwo major airfields are located near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Alekseevka, Georgia|Alekseevka]] and [[Marneuli]].\n\n=== Georgian Coast Guard (Former Naval Force) ===\n{{main article|Georgian Navy}}\nIn 2007 the Strategic Defence Review said the Georgian Navy protects Georgia\u2019s territorial waters and contributes to the collective maritime defence in the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Georgian Navy was abolished in 2009 and was incorporated into the Coast Guard, which is not structurally part of the Defense Forces, but rather it is a subunit of the Border Guard of Georgia, which is under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  The [[Coast Guard of Georgia]] is responsible for maintenance of the sovereignty of the country and for protection of internal territorial waters and economic zones. The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Poti]].\n\n[[File:Georgian coast guard in the port of Batumi.jpg|thumb|Georgian [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] vessels]]\nThe other, smaller Coast Guard base is in [[Batumi]]. Besides the naval force, the navy also includes a Special Counter-terrorist Detachment force. Georgia is also one of the founding members and a participant of the [[Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group]]. Before the war with Russia, the Georgian navy had 19 naval vessels. 4 of them were sunk during the conflict, and nine rigid-hull inflatables were captured by Russia. The Georgians raised and returned to service two of the sunken vessels, and partially replaced their losses with Turkish-built patrol/fast attack boats. Their heaviest armaments are 25\u221230mm cannons. However, no Georgian navy vessels are armed with ship-to-ship missiles.\n\n=== National Guard of Georgia ===\nThe [[National Guard of Georgia]] was established on December 20, 1990 and was manned mainly by volunteers. It represents the first Georgian armed formation, which became the base of the foundation for modern Defense Forces of Georgia. The Guard actively participated in the conflicts that occurred in Georgian territory (Samachablo, Abkhazia).\n\nThe National Guard used to consist of 20,554 personnel, but has now been reduced to 550. The main missions of the National Guard are:\n\n#Support civil government in crisis situations (natural, technological, ecological);\n#Register mobilization resources, study and deliver;\n#Convene, select and man of citizens on the basis of the agreement, for the units, subunits and bases of the Defense Forces;\n#Provide ceremonial activity support;\n#Assisting in training the Reserve Forces.\n\n=== Army Reserve and Territorial Defence Forces ===\n\nThe Army Reserve is a professional reserve force consisting of former regular army personnel only. Due to the amount of experience, the Reserve personnel would be set-in for replacement of losses in the ranks of regular formations and will if needed also operate in the vanguard of a combined mechanized group or an infantry assault.\n\nThe Territorial Defence Forces were established for immediate readiness of the population in crisis events, such as war. Its main goals would be the fortification and defence of all populated and strategically important areas as well as providing quick aid or security for evacuation operations in case of natural catastrophes.\n\nOther than the active army reserve which consists of only ex military personnel, the Territorial Defence Forces are rather sparsely prepared for complex military operations. It instead provides more comfort for the regular forces in case of war. By acting as additional logistical arm and leaving the actual combat to them. With the land forces and reserve army engaged in direct action the Defence Force's most important task would be to construct trenches, bunkers and obstacles around strategically important areas and position themselves on systematically formed defensive lines. The number of conscripts does not exceed 140,000 and is reasonably large, as it is in the strategy's intention to use any possible geographical advantage over the enemy, when professionalism is compensated by that factor.\n\nThe TDF reservist is comparably poorly equipped for modern warfare. The number of combat, protection gear and supplies will be most likely limited in the event of war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare. The weapons trained on are mainly of soviet origin and abandoned material used formerly by the regular land forces, including tanks. Such weapons are the AK series assault rifles and the [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled launchers.\n\n=== Commissioned officers ===\n{{Main article|Officer (armed forces)}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|}\n\n== International cooperation ==\n[[File:Georgian Army - Operations abroad since 1991.png|thumb|Operations abroad since 1991.]]\n[[File:GeorgianArmy.jpg|thumb|Georgian troops listening to a speech in Baghdad, Iraq]]\n\nThe Defense Forces have been participating in peacekeeping missions (the [[Balkans]], [[Persian Gulf]]) since 1999.\n\nUnits participating in peacekeeping missions are manned by professional soldiers, the duration of the mission is six months and participation is voluntary. The readiness assessment criteria are, as follows: health condition, physical fitness, professional skills and experience.\n\n=== Peacekeeping missions ===\n[[File:U.S. Marines and Georgian Army soldiers conduct operation Northern Lion II, Part I 130703-M-YH552-0074.jpg|thumb|right|Georgian soldiers during Operation Northern Lion II, Afghanistan]]\n{{Main article|Role of Georgia in the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Role of Georgia in the Iraq War}}\n\nAbout 200 Georgian troops were deployed in the Kosovo ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) in 1999\u20132008, 70 were deployed in Iraq ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]]) in 2003 and 50 in Afghanistan in 2004 ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]). From 2004 in Iraq were 300 Georgian troops. From 2005 approximately 850 troops were serving under Coalition Command ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] and [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq|UNAMI]]). On July 2007 Georgia sent an extra 1,400 troops to [[Iraq]]; that brought the total number of troops in Iraq to 2,000. About 300 of these troops were assigned to Taskforce Petro and stationed at COP Cleary outside the town of Wahida near Salman Pak, Iraq. On August 8, 2008 Georgia announced it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq due to rising hostilities with Russia. Their preparedness and training skills are evaluated on highest level by international experts. The entire Iraq contingent has been airlifted back to Georgia.\n\nHence, owing to participation in international [[peacekeeping]] missions the military members are able to obtain practical experience and to show readiness to cooperate with [[NATO]] and with other partner countries' forces.\n\nCurrently there are more than 1,570 Georgian combat troops  deployed in [[Helmand]], [[Afghanistan]] where Georgia has thus far suffered 22 deaths and over a hundred injuries.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23895 Tenth Georgia Soldier Killed in Afghanistan] Retrieved: September 1, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Seth Robson |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-training-a-dual-mission-for-georgians-1.136920 |title=U.S. training a dual mission for Georgians |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> In September 2012, Georgia stated that it would continue its contributions in Afghanistan following the 2014 NATO withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2012_new_army_military_defence_industry/georgia_will_continue_its_contribution_for_nato_mission_in_afghanistan_in_post-2014_period_1009122.html Georgia keeps helping Afghanistan] - Armyrecognition.com, September 10, 2012</ref>\nIn November 2012, Georgia had doubled the number of troops deployed to fight with Nato-led forces in Afghanistan to over 1,500.

More recent developments however have their roots in the Soviet Union. In 1941 Georgia became one of the most important Soviet weapon manufacturing countries during the [[Second World War]]. It was responsible for providing the Soviet Army with all types of aircraft and ammunition. [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]]'s role didn't change after the war. Up until 1990 Georgia was producing various types of fighter aircraft, most notably the [[Su-25]] since it was produced almost exclusively in Georgia, unmanned areal vehicles, missiles, satellite components and orbital satellites. The company lost most of its functionality and production capability when the Soviet Union dissolved, yet was not abandoned. In the late 1990s Georgia's JSC RMP and later the newly established Ministry of Defence section [[STC DELTA|DELTA]] started to work on the development of ballistic equipment using their own ingredients. The advanced research unit had successfully developed a variety of personal protection gear, such as bomb disposal suits and level I-IV body armour using classified mixtures of domestic resource. These projects never went beyond some prototypes, mainly due to poor attention and financing from the government.\n\nWith foreign support primarily from the United States since 2005, Georgia became able to start building a solid industrial base for the military. From 2001 to 2007, Delta experimented with unmanned aerial vehicles and modified parts for helicopters and Su-25 aircraft until it got involved in the modification of Georgia's T-72 tank fleet. In 2009-10, with enough experience and expertise and the assistance of designer [[Zviad Tsikolia]], Delta created its first prototype of an armored personnel carrier, the [[Didgori Armoured Personnel Carrier|Didgori]]. Early tests were highly successful so that its first production line started already in 2011.  Two versions would initially serve in the armed forces in 2012, followed by different modifications from 2013 on. The [[Lazika]] is Delta's attempt to manufacture a suitable modular infantry fighting vehicle created for multiple tasks. While still under development, some Lazikas are already in active service. Delta considers the Lazika as one of the best vehicles of its class bearing armour technology similar to that of Israel. The remotely operated systems are locally produced as well. Due to \"misdirected financing\" and heavy interfering of former government officials, project Lazika was temporarily cancelled in late 2012, also due to \"sabotage\" and shortcomings in its armour research, but then later continued in early 2013 when a newly elected government took charge. \n\nAs of 2007 Georgia has been domestically producing uniforms for its military personnel. Early products were of poor quality, and such shortcomings were only corrected beginning in 2012. Since then only high quality fabrics are licensed for use. Other main production lines include various types of artillery systems such as [[MLRS]], mortars and corresponding ammunition, anti-tank weapons and devices, full uniform sets for ceremonies and for all service branches, including boots, hats, assault vests, pouches, and backpacks. New kind of ballistic vests and helmets have been developed and produced for military service since 2013. The Georgian production uses techniques based on know-how from aerospace research whose methods differ slightly yet significantly from foreign ones. Among the first units to use these new items is the peacekeeping contingent currently stationed in the Central African Republic.\n\n== Bases ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Location\n|-\n|Ministry of Defence Headquarters\n|[[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Vaziani Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Krtsanisi National Training Centre|Krtsanisi Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Akhalkalaki Military Base\n|[[Akhalkalaki]]\n|-\n|Alekseevka Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Marneuli Airbase\n|[[Marneuli]]\n|-\n|Bolnisi Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Gori Military Base\n|[[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]\n|-\n|Senaki Military Base\n|[[Senaki]]\n|-\n|Poti naval base\n|[[Poti]]\n|-\n|Mukhrovani Military Base\n|[[Mukhrovani]]\n|-\n|Kutaisi Military Base\n|[[Kutaisi]]\n|-\n|Khelvachauri Military Base\n|[[Khelvachauri]]\n|-\n|Khoni Military Base\n|[[Khoni]]\n|-\n|Batumi naval base\n|[[Batumi]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Georgia and NATO]]\n*[[Modern equipment of the Georgian Army]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{StateDept}} 2005\n{{CIA World Factbook|year=2005}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Denise Hammick, Country Briefing: Georgia On the Cusp, [[Jane's Defence Weekly]], 2 January 2008\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Military of Georgia}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052953/http://www.geo-army.ge/ geo-army.ge, an information website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121207132407/http://www.mod.gov.ge/2007/downloads/The_Strategic_Defence_Review(www.mod.gov.ge).pdf Ministry of Defence of Georgia: The Strategic Defence Review 2007.] ''mod.gov.ge''.

It has generally potent activity as an agonist of the mammalian [[glycine receptor]], the activation of which leads to an inhibitory [[postsynaptic potential]] in neurons following [[chloride]] ion influx, and systemically, to muscle relaxation of varying intensity and deleterious effect. Despite its danger and toxicity, recent pharmacological research has suggested that the biological activities of this compound may offer opportunities for developing treatments related to xenobiotic- or diet-induced oxidative stress, and of anxiety and other conditions, with ongoing research including attempts to identify safer derivatives and analogs to make use of gelsemine's beneficial effects.\n\n==Natural sources==\n{{expand section | with further secondary source-derived content on the complete, known range of species in which this compound has been found, and on distribution information within those plants, variations as a function of season, etc.| small = no | date = February 2017}}\n[[Image:Gelsemium sempervirens 001.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Picture of plant climbing a trellis, with dar green foliage, and numerous bright yellow flowers. | Example of a ''Gelsemium'' species, from which gelsemine is isolated ''Gelsemium sempervirens'', its principal source in the Americas.<ref name = ZhangWang14r/><ref name=Ornduff70/>]]\nGelsemine is found in, and can be isolated from, the subtropical to tropical flowering plant genus ''[[Gelsemium sempervirens|Gelsemium]]'', family [[Loganiaceae]], which as of 2014 included five species, where ''G. sempervirens'' Ait., the type species, is prevalent in the Americas and ''G. elegans'' Benth. in China and East Asia,<ref name = ZhangWang14r>{{cite journal | author1 = Zhang, Jing-Yang |author2=Wang, Yong X. | year=2014| title = Gelsemium Analgesia and the Spinal Glycine Receptor/Allopregnanolone Pathway | journal = Fitoterapia | volume = 100 | issue = C;

Approximately 120 alkaloids have been isolated and identified from Gelsemium, with the predominant indole alkaloids including gelsemine, koumine, gelsemicine, gelsenicine, gelsedine, sempervirine, koumidine, koumicine and humantenine. Gelsemine is the principal active alkaloid in G. sempervirens Ait., and koumine and gelsemine are the most and second-most dominant alkaloids in G. elegans Benth. Gelsemium extract and its active alkaloids serve a variety of biological functions, including neurobiological, immunosuppressive and antitumor effects, and have traditionally been used to treat pain, neuralgia, anxiety, insomnia, asthma, respiratory ailments and cancers. This review focuses on animal-based studies of Gelsemium as a pain treatment and its mechanism of action. In contrast to morphine, when administered intrathecally and systemically, koumine, gelsemine and gelsenicine have marked antinociception in inflammatory, neuropathic and bone cancer pains without inducing antinociceptive tolerance. Gelsemium and its active alkaloids may produce antinociception by activating the spinal \u03b13 glycine/allopregnanolone pathway. The results of this review support the clinical use of Gelsemium and suggest that its active alkaloids may be developed to treat intractable and other types of pain, preferably after chemical modification. However, Gelsemium is a known toxic plant, and its toxicity limits its appropriate dosage and clinical use. To avoid or decrease the side/toxic effects of Gelsemium, an individual monomer of highly potent alkaloids must be selected, or alkaloids that exhibit greater \u03b13 glycine receptor selectivity may be discovered or modified.

Approximately 120 alkaloids have been isolated and identified from Gelsemium, with the predominant indole alkaloids including gelsemine, koumine, gelsemicine, gelsenicine, gelsedine, sempervirine, koumidine, koumicine and humantenine. Gelsemine is the principal active alkaloid in G. sempervirens Ait., and koumine and gelsemine are the most and second-most dominant alkaloids in G. elegans Benth. Gelsemium extract and its active alkaloids serve a variety of biological functions, including neurobiological, immunosuppressive and antitumor effects, and have traditionally been used to treat pain, neuralgia, anxiety, insomnia, asthma, respiratory ailments and cancers. This review focuses on animal-based studies of Gelsemium as a pain treatment and its mechanism of action. In contrast to morphine, when administered intrathecally and systemically, koumine, gelsemine and gelsenicine have marked antinociception in inflammatory, neuropathic and bone cancer pains without inducing antinociceptive tolerance. Gelsemium and its active alkaloids may produce antinociception by activating the spinal \u03b13 glycine/allopregnanolone pathway. The results of this review support the clinical use of Gelsemium and suggest that its active alkaloids may be developed to treat intractable and other types of pain, preferably after chemical modification. However, Gelsemium is a known toxic plant, and its toxicity limits its appropriate dosage and clinical use. To avoid or decrease the side/toxic effects of Gelsemium, an individual monomer of highly potent alkaloids must be selected, or alkaloids that exhibit greater \u03b13 glycine receptor selectivity may be discovered or modified.
