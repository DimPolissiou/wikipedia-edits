The shield in its entirety was featured on the now-obsolete round \u00a31 coin. The 10p coin depicts part of the first quarter of the shield, showing two of the lions passant from the Royal Banner of England, with the words <small>TEN PENCE</small> above the shield design. The coin's obverse remains largely unchanged, but the beading (the ring of dots around the coin's circumference), which no longer features on the coin's reverse, has also been removed from the obverse.\n\nIn March 2018, new designs were released, one for each of the 26 letters of the alphabet. [[Anne Jessopp]], chief executive of the Royal Mint, described the designs as \"iconic themes that are quintessentially British\".

The next segment of the race is a {{convert|33|km}} run up the [[Deception River]], through Goat Pass and then down the [[Mingha River]] to the [[Bealey River]] and SH 73 at Klondyke Corner. For the two-day event, competitors overnight here. \n\nFrom Klondyke Corner, a {{convert|15|km}} cycling leg along SH 73 brings competitors to the [[Waimakariri River]] at Mount White Bridge. From here, competitors kayak {{convert|67|km}} down the river to the Waimakariri Gorge Bridge (Route 72). \n\nUntil 2014, the final segment was a {{convert|70|km}} cycling race along Old West Coast Road and through [[Christchurch]] (via SH 73, SH 76, SH 74A, Ferry Road and Main Road) to the finish at [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] Beach, on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. \n\nFrom 2015, the route was shifted north of the [[Waimakariri River]] to follow South Eyre Road, then travelling through north-eastern Christchurch to finish at [[New Brighton, New Zealand|New Brighton]] beach, a total distance just 500&nbsp;metres shorter than the original. The main reason for the change was to avoid competitors contending with numerous traffic lights through Christchurch's inner suburbs.\n\n* Start line, Kumara beach: {{coord|42.5725|S|171.1157|E|name=Kumara start line|region:NZ-WTC_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Kumara Junction transition (run-cycle): {{coord|42.5881|S|171.1319|E|name=Kumara Junction transition (cycle-run)|region:NZ-WTC_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Aickins transition (cycle-run): {{coord|42.7714|S|171.6253|E|name=Aickins transition (cycle-run)|region:NZ-WTC_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Klondyke Corner transition/overnight (run-cycle): {{coord|43.0040|S|171.5894|E|name=Klondyke Corner transition/overnight (run-cycle)|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Mount White Bridge transition (cycle-kayak): {{coord|43.0045|S|171.7479|E|name=Mount White Bridge transition (cycle-kayak)|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Waimakariri Gorge Bridge transition (kayak-cycle): {{coord|43.3606|S|172.0507|E|name=Waimakariri Gorge Bridge transition (kayak-cycle)|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n* Finish line, New Brighton Beach: {{coord|43.51423|S|172.73482|E|name=New Brighton Beach|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n:* Historic finish line, Sumner beach: {{coord|43.5663|S|172.7594|E|name=Sumner finish line|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n\n==Individual races==\n\n===1983 race===\nThe inaugural race was held on 26 and 27 February, a Saturday and Sunday. There were a total of 79 competitor, of whom 77 finished the race. In the individual race, 49 competitors made it to the finish line, and 28 competitors finished in the two-person event. The race was initially only available over two days. Three competitors attended from overseas: Dave Horning was a triathlete from the United States, Tom Barichello was from Canada, and the eventual race winner in the individual men's category was English anaesthesist Joe Sherriff, who was temporarily living in [[Dunedin]]. Due to the staggered starts on the second morning, [[Graeme Dingle]] was leading Sherriff, but Sherriff would have had to cross the finish line two minutes ahead of Dingle to compensate for the staggered start. Sherriff caught the first glimpse of Dingle just outside [[Ferrymead]] and as he was riding with a strong bunch, he managed to take 4 minutes 30 seconds off Dingle, enough for a win. Of the women, Stella Sweney from Nelson won decisively, over two and a half hours ahead of Annie Hope coming in second. Sweney would win more than just her first race.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=27\u201335}} The main sponsor for the event was [[Macpac]], and [[Steinlager]] was a co-sponsor \u2013 their contribution was 20 dozen cans of beer.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=17, 25}}\n\n===1984 race===\nThere were 139 competitors for the second event. The inaugural race received little media attention, but this changed in 1984 with James Daniels from the [[ZM Christchurch|3ZM]] radio station in Christchurch competing in the event. Daniels would stop every now and then and provide live commentary. And there was lots to talk about, as the weather was atrocious. Climbing up the [[Deception River]], the weather deteriorated. Competitors who were slower faced ever higher water levels and could not undertake the many river crossings by themselves, but had to wait for others to link arms. The temperature at Goat Pass was 4 degrees Celsius. Despite the conditions, [[John Howard (adventure racer)|John Howard]] finished the first day 10 minutes faster than the 1983 winner's time; Howard had missed the event the previous year as he wanted to save himself for a major triathlon a week later in the United States (which, due to an administrative bungle, he could not get to).{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=36\u201343}}\n\nOn the second day, a southerly had come through and the [[Waimakariri River]] was in flood; eleven competitors pulled out in this section, rescued by helicopter or jet boat, or simply giving up before entering the [[Waimakariri Gorge|gorge]]. Howard had been the race favourite and at the end of the second day, he had knocked 90 minutes off Sherriff's winning time from last year for a clear win of the men's competition. Sherriff had travelled from England to try for another win (and to marry his fianc\u00e9e), but came a disappointing 18th place. Stella Sweney once more won the women's race. The main sponsor for the 1984 race was brewer [[Lion (Australasian company)|Lion Brown]].{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=36\u201343}}\n\n===1985 race===\nIn the third year, there were 321 competitors, and the race was held on 2 and 3 February. Based on the high number of competitors who had to be rescued of the kayaking section, Judkins made it compulsory that competitors had proficiency in kayaking; either a certificate from a canoe club, surf lifesaving club, or another canoeist stating that they are a competent grade two to three paddler. It was the first time that a significant number of [[North Island]] entries were received. It was raining heavily in the mountains when the race started. The first cycling leg is remembered for a bunch of six riders encountering about 30 sheep that dashed onto the road. Dave Horning, the American who had competed in the first race, had again come to New Zealand. He described his experience running the flooded Deception River section thus:{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=44\u201352}}\n\n{{Cquote|text=One moment we would be splashing upstream in ankle-deep water, and the next we would be in over our heads. They should have called this section the swimming leg. It often took a team effort to make the more treacherous river crossings. Joining hands, groups of athletes cautiously forded the swift-flowing river.\n|author=Dave Horning\n|source={{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=46f}}}}\n\nTerry Newlands had the men's individual fastest time on the first day, but he was ill-prepared for the kayaking section. The [[Auckland]]er had brought a [[surf ski]] and had tested it on the lower Waimakariri River before the race. The conditions on the upper Waimakariri were vastly different on race day, and wearing shorts, Newlands pulled out of the race suffering from [[hypothermia]] before entering the gorge. Horning also pulled out, unable to cope with kayaking the swollen river. Brian Sander, a science technician from [[Wellington]], won the men's individual race, 26 seconds ahead of Greg Dobson. Sandy Fletcher won the individual women's event, with Tui Elliot second and the previous winner, Stella Sweney, in third place.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=44\u201352}} Fletcher had been registered for the 1984 race in a team, but had to pull out before the race due to injury; she supported her husband Bernie Fletcher instead, helping him to win the men's team category. The Fletchers had for years lived in Britain and raced in kayaking events, including at world championships. Sandy Fletcher had come fourth in the first New Zealand national road cycling championships. The 1985 Coast to Coast was the only one that she would ever enter.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=121f}}\n\nLast year's individual men's winner, John Howard, had entered the team event with Eric Saggers. Ten days before the race, he had suffered a high-speed downhill crash and turned up to the race briefing \"bandaged like a [[mummy]]\" after having lost a lot of skin. They won the team event.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=44\u201352}} The main sponsor for the 1985 race was, like the previous year, the brewer Lion Brown.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=49}}\n\n===1986 race===\nIn 1986, there were 347 competitors, including quite a number of athletes from overseas. Unlike the previous two years, the weather was fine. The character of the race had changed, and having the right gear became a much more important component. Greg Dobson was the first athlete, in 1986, to get sponsorship, and he took five months off work to train for the event. Local radio stations gave progress updates and 3,000 spectators gathered at Sumner beach to see the competitors come in. Steinlager as the main sponsor had enabled scaffolding to be erected with a large banner at the finish line. Greg Dobson was the first individual man across the line, and he won the event; the first to break the 12-hour mark. Brian Sanders came second; the two had swapped places compared to 1985.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=53\u201363}} Jane Reeves, a radiographer from Christchurch, won the individual women's event; she had been leading her category from the start of the race.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=53\u201363, }}\n\n===1987 race===\nThe 1987 event was held on 7 and 8 February. New Zealand Breweries was the main sponsor, and they promoted their brand Steinlager through the race. The two-day event was entered by 143 individuals and 62 two-person teams. The two-day race has long been remembered for the crash involving 20 cyclists some {{convert|20|km}} into the race. [[1982 Commonwealth Games]] gold medallist cyclist [[Craig Adair]], who was establishing himself as a bike show owner at the time, was the event mechanic and he got cleaned out of spare parts by the crash. Terry Newlands from Auckland lost one of the sole from his shoes with an hour to go on the mountain run, and this slowed him down, but owing to a strong performance on the river, he won the men's two-day event. The fastest woman was Penny Webster, a teacher from [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=64\u201370}}\n\nBut what made the 1987 remarkable was the introduction of the \"Longest Day\"; the option for individual athletes to complete the event during a single day. There were 42 competitors who signed up: 40 men and 2 women. It was a gamble, as it was unknown whether humans could sustain the difficult conditions. There were other events that took a whole day to complete, most notably the [[Ironman World Championship]] that had been held on Hawaii since 1978, but none of these included such difficult conditions. Doctors were thus placed at the end of the mountain run, checking that the competitors were in a state that would allow them to continue, and none were pulled out of the field by the medical profession. The two women who entered had both previously won the two-day event: Stella Sweney in 1983 and 1984, and Jane Reeves in 1986. Reeves pulled out of the race in the kayaking section, and Sweney and her brother John stopped to rescue Reeves' kayak. The Sweney siblings were the last one-day competitors to cross the line in Sumner, but Stella Sweney added a third event title to her collection.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=64\u201370}}\n\nOf the Longest Day men, Eric Saggers was the first to finish the first bike section. He needed a good lead on Russell Prince, who was considered the stronger mountain runner, and Saggers had a lead of 2 min 29 sec. Prince overtook him up the Deception River close to Goat Pass and never saw another competitor. At Sumner, Prince had a 16-minute lead over John McKenzie, with a [[University of Canterbury]] student in third place \u2013 [[Steve Gurney]]. Saggers came fifth.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=64\u201370, 141}}\n\nRussell Prince had, literally, first come across the event in 1984. The heavy rain had forced him and his brothers out from a hunting trip at the headwaters of the Waimakariri River. Arriving back at the [[New Zealand State Highway 73|main road]] at Klondyke Corner, they saw a congregation of people and thought it must have been a large search and rescue party; they went over to offer their help. But they had walked into the overnight camp at the end of the mountain run, and one of the competitors explained to Prince what the event involved. Intrigued, Prince decided to participate the following year.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=43}} Prince came fifth in 1985,{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=135}} third in 1986,{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=135}} before winning the inaugural Longest Day in 1987.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=141}}\n\n===1988 race===\nFor the 1988 race, Judkins had set a limit of 400 competitors. He took delight in opening registrations in June of each year for the following event, and the places were snapped up within days. It was the first time that the event had sold out. New Zealand Breweries was again the main sponsor, and they promoted their brand Steinlager. For the first time, Judkins had celebrity entrants, with two former [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] putting their name forward: [[Brian Ford (rugby player)|Brian Ford]] and [[Kevin Eveleigh]]. [[John Jacoby]] entered the Longest Day after having come second in the 1987 team event with fellow Australian Andrew Maffett, who in 1988 was his support person. Jacoby had won the three previous World Cup [[canoe marathon]]s and was thus a top contender. Greg Dobson as the Longest Day race leader was five minutes ahead of Jacoby entering the river, but leaving the river, Jacoby had 14 minutes on Steve Gurney, who in turn had overtaken Dobson. Jacoby held this lead to Sumner in a time of 12:02:59 hours. He narrowly missed out on winning a [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]35,000 [[Ford Laser]] TX3 Turbo, which was the price for the first competitor to break the 12-hour mark.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=71\u201376}} In July 1988, Jacoby won the inaugural [[ICF canoe marathon|ICF canoe marathon World Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|title=First World Marathon Racing Championships|url=https://www.canoeicf.com/sites/default/files/1988_world_ch_nottingham_gbr.pdf|publisher=[[International Canoe Federation]]|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=24 July 1988}}</ref>\n\nThere was only one woman competing in the Longest Day, and she was there only because Judkins had talked her into it. Denise Higgison from [[Tauranga]] was the last individual to finish the Longest Day in a time of 17:22:08 hours, but this secured her the win in her category.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=73, 145}}\n\nThe two-day individual women's race was a competition between the 1987 winner, Penny Webster, and Claire Parkes. The deciding factor was a bad crash on her bike that cost Webster seven minutes, but that also injured her and reduced her performance. In the end, Parkes won 48 minutes ahead of Webster, who came in third place.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=73, 76, 145}} The individual men's two-day event was won by Daniel Forsyth.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=145}} Greg Coyle came last in the individual two-day event, with just over 23 hours, but for him, the important thing was to have done the race. He commented later: {{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=76}}\n\n{{Cquote|text=I sometimes go to the Cave Rock Hotel in [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]]. You're virtually a leper if you haven't done it. No one will talk to you, you've got nothing to talk about. It's as if you smell because you haven't done the Coast to Coast \u2013 it's like stigma. If you have, then it's like belonging to a funny kind of \u00e9lite.\n|author=Greg Coyle\n|source={{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=76}}}}\n\n===1989 race===\nA few things were new for the 1989, and some of them caused a furore. First of all, the New Zealand Tourism Department\u2014a government agency\u2014became involved as they recognised the potential for event tourism. They organised and funded foreign journalists to come and cover the event. One of those was English botanist [[David Bellamy]], who did not just report from the event, but decided to compete.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=77}} Another innovation was drug testing; this was Judkins' ploy to have the race known as the \"World Championship of Kayak, Cycle, Run\". In the end, it was the only event where drug testing was carried out, only the first three men of the Longest Day were required to give urine samples, and the samples were sent to [[Christchurch Hospital]] for testing of stimulants, rather than Canada for testing for [[anabolic steroid]]s as previously announced.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=77, 83}} Gurney and Prince, who had lobbied for drug testing, were critical of the scaled-back testing regime and claimed that some competitors were using steroids.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=83}} But the real controversy was caused by the sponsorship: New Zealand Breweries had decided to promote their South Island brand [[Speight's]], and it was their sexist slogan that caused the outcry: \"The stuff Southern Men are made of.\" Female competitors hissed and booed, and there was much discussion in the media, and media attention always pleased Judkins. People made their views known by slogans on the support vehicles. Gurney threatened to wear a dress if he managed to win the Longest Day. The brewery simply responded that their main target audience was men.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=77, 79}}\n\nIn the women's Longest Day event, Claire Parkes defeated Penny Webster. They had been neck to neck until the kayak section, where Webster pulled away.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=79}} Three competitors were well clear of the rest of the field in the men's Longest Day event; at the transition to the kayak, Prince had seven minutes on Gurney, who in turn had one minute on Jacoby. The latter shone in his specialist kayaking discipline and when leaving the river had a lead of four minutes on Gurney, and eighteen minutes on Prince. On the last cycling leg, Jacoby could even increase his lead, and he finished in 11:27:19 hours. Gurney and Prince also broke the 12-hour mark, but Jacoby had won the car (that year, a Suzuki was up for grabs) and a return trip to London. Gurney thus missed out on his chance to wear a dress during the prize-giving.\n\nIn the men's individual two-day category, Doug Lomax won the race. Lomax had been motivated to do well by somebody calling him fat, and he had slimmed down from {{convert|96|kg|st}} to {{convert|80|kg|st}} prior to the race. But in either case, this was just a test-run prior to the 1990 competition, where he intended to contest the Longest Day in the veteran's category, as he would have turned 40 by then.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=81f}} The individual women's category was won by Vivienne Prince, the wife of Russell Prince.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=56, 150}}<!-- \n\n===1992 race===\nThe sponsorship contribution of Speight's was NZ$500,000 this year.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=25}} Webster returned after a break during which she had a baby.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=79}} \n\n===2009 race===\nThe 2009 race was held on 13 and 14 February.<ref name=\"2009 The Year of The Woman\" />\n-->\n\n==Race results==\nThe following race results are for individuals competing either in the two-day (since 1983) or one-day (\"Longest Day\"; since 1987) event.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=133\u2013182}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Race Records |url=http://www.coasttocoast.co.nz/race-results/previous-race-results/race-records/ |publisher=Coast to Coast |accessdate=9 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Two-day results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=2| Year\n!colspan=3| Men\n!colspan=3| Women\n|-\n!

It is run from the west coast to the east coast of the [[South Island]], and features [[running]], [[cycling]] and [[kayaking]] elements over a total of {{convert|243|km}}.

The next segment of the race is a {{convert|33|km}} run up the [[Deception River]], through Goat Pass and then down the [[Mingha River]] to the [[Bealey River]] and SH 73 at Klondyke Corner. For the two-day event, competitors overnight here. \n\nFrom Klondyke Corner, a {{convert|15|km}} cycling leg along SH 73 brings competitors to the [[Waimakariri River]] at Mount White Bridge. From here, competitors kayak {{convert|67|km}} down the river to the Waimakariri Gorge Bridge (Route 72). \n\nUntil 2014, the final segment was a {{convert|70|km}} cycling race along Old West Coast Road and through [[Christchurch]] (via SH 73, SH 76, SH 74A, Ferry Road and Main Road) to the finish at [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] Beach, on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. \n\nFrom 2015, the route was shifted north of the [[Waimakariri River]] to follow South Eyre Road, then travelling through north-eastern Christchurch to finish at [[New Brighton, New Zealand|New Brighton]] beach, a total distance just 500&nbsp;metres shorter than the original. The main reason for the change was to avoid competitors contending with numerous traffic lights through Christchurch's inner suburbs.\n\n* Start line, Kumara beach: {{coord|42.5725|S|171.1157|E|name=Kumara start line|region:NZ-WTC_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Kumara Junction transition (run-cycle): {{coord|42.5881|S|171.1319|E|name=Kumara Junction transition (cycle-run)|region:NZ-WTC_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Aickins transition (cycle-run): {{coord|42.7714|S|171.6253|E|name=Aickins transition (cycle-run)|region:NZ-WTC_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Klondyke Corner transition/overnight (run-cycle): {{coord|43.0040|S|171.5894|E|name=Klondyke Corner transition/overnight (run-cycle)|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Mount White Bridge transition (cycle-kayak): {{coord|43.0045|S|171.7479|E|name=Mount White Bridge transition (cycle-kayak)|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}} \n* Waimakariri Gorge Bridge transition (kayak-cycle): {{coord|43.3606|S|172.0507|E|name=Waimakariri Gorge Bridge transition (kayak-cycle)|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n* Finish line, New Brighton Beach: {{coord|43.51423|S|172.73482|E|name=New Brighton Beach|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n:* Historic finish line, Sumner beach: {{coord|43.5663|S|172.7594|E|name=Sumner finish line|region:NZ-CAN_type:landmark|display=inline}}\n\n==Individual races==\n\n===1983 race===\nThe inaugural race was held on 26 and 27 February, a Saturday and Sunday. There were a total of 79 competitor, of whom 77 finished the race. In the individual race, 49 competitors made it to the finish line, and 28 competitors finished in the two-person event. The race was initially only available over two days. Three competitors attended from overseas: Dave Horning was a triathlete from the United States, Tom Barichello was from Canada, and the eventual race winner in the individual men's category was English anaesthesist Joe Sherriff, who was temporarily living in [[Dunedin]]. Due to the staggered starts on the second morning, [[Graeme Dingle]] was leading Sherriff, but Sherriff would have had to cross the finish line two minutes ahead of Dingle to compensate for the staggered start. Sherriff caught the first glimpse of Dingle just outside [[Ferrymead]] and as he was riding with a strong bunch, he managed to take 4 minutes 30 seconds off Dingle, enough for a win. Of the women, Stella Sweney from Nelson won decisively, over two and a half hours ahead of Annie Hope coming in second. Sweney would win more than just her first race.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=27\u201335}} The main sponsor for the event was [[Macpac]], and [[Steinlager]] was a co-sponsor \u2013 their contribution was 20 dozen cans of beer.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=17, 25}}\n\n===1984 race===\nThere were 139 competitors for the second event. The inaugural race received little media attention, but this changed in 1984 with James Daniels from the [[ZM Christchurch|3ZM]] radio station in Christchurch competing in the event. Daniels would stop every now and then and provide live commentary. And there was lots to talk about, as the weather was atrocious. Climbing up the [[Deception River]], the weather deteriorated. Competitors who were slower faced ever higher water levels and could not undertake the many river crossings by themselves, but had to wait for others to link arms. The temperature at Goat Pass was 4 degrees Celsius. Despite the conditions, [[John Howard (adventure racer)|John Howard]] finished the first day 10 minutes faster than the 1983 winner's time; Howard had missed the event the previous year as he wanted to save himself for a major triathlon a week later in the United States (which, due to an administrative bungle, he could not get to).{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=36\u201343}}\n\nOn the second day, a southerly had come through and the [[Waimakariri River]] was in flood; eleven competitors pulled out in this section, rescued by helicopter or jet boat, or simply giving up before entering the [[Waimakariri Gorge|gorge]]. Howard had been the race favourite and at the end of the second day, he had knocked 90 minutes off Sherriff's winning time from last year for a clear win of the men's competition. Sherriff had travelled from England to try for another win (and to get married to his fianc\u00e9e), but came a disappointing 18th place. Stella Sweney once more won the women's race. The main sponsor for the 1984 race was brewer [[Lion (Australasian company)|Lion Brown]].{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=36\u201343}}\n\n===1985 race===\nIn the third year, there were 321 competitors, and the race was held on 2 and 3 February. Based on the high number of competitors who had to be rescued of the kayaking section, Judkins made it compulsory that competitors had proficiency in kayaking; either a certificate from a canoe club, surf lifesaving club, or another canoeist stating that they are a competent grade two to three paddler. It was the first time that a significant number of [[North Island]] entries were received. It was raining heavily in the mountains when the race started. The first cycling leg is remembered for a bunch of six riders encountering about 30 sheep that dashed onto the road. Dave Horning, the American who had competed in the first race, had again come to New Zealand. He described his experience running the flooded Deception River section thus:{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=44\u201352}}\n\n{{Cquote|text=One moment we would be splashing upstream in ankle-deep water, and the next we would be in over our heads. They should have called this section the swimming leg. It often took a team effort to make the more treacherous river crossings. Joining hands, groups of athletes cautiously forded the swift-flowing river.\n|author=Dave Horning\n|source={{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=46f}}}}\n\nTerry Newlands had the men's individual fastest time on the first day, but he was ill-prepared for the kayaking section. The [[Auckland]]er had brought a [[surf ski]] and had tested it on the lower Waimakariri River before the race. The conditions on the upper Waimakariri were vastly different on race day, and wearing shorts, Newlands pulled out of the race suffering from [[hypothermia]] before entering the gorge. Horning also pulled out, unable to cope with kayaking the swollen river. Brian Sander, a science technician from [[Wellington]], won the men's individual race, 26 seconds ahead of Greg Dobson. Sandy Fletcher won the individual women's event, with Tui Elliot second and the previous winner, Stella Sweney, in third place.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=44\u201352}} Fletcher had been registered for the 1984 race in a team, but had to pull out before the race due to injury; she supported her husband Bernie Fletcher instead, helping him to win the men's team category. The Fletchers had for years lived in Britain and raced in kayaking events, including at world championships. Sandy Fletcher had come fourth in the first New Zealand national road cycling championships. The 1985 Coast to Coast was the only one that she would ever enter.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=121f}}\n\nLast year's individual men's winner, John Howard, had entered the team event with Eric Saggers. Ten days before the race, he had suffered a high-speed downhill crash and turned up to the race briefing \"bandaged like a [[mummy]]\" after having lost a lot of skin. They won the team event.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=44\u201352}} The main sponsor for the 1985 race was, like the previous year, the brewer Lion Brown.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=49}}\n\n===1986 race===\nIn 1986, there were 347 competitors, including quite a number of athletes from overseas. Unlike the previous two years, the weather was fine. The character of the race had changed, and having the right gear became a much more important component. Greg Dobson was the first athlete, in 1986, to get sponsorship, and he took five months off work to train for the event. Local radio stations gave progress updates and 3,000 spectators gathered at Sumner beach to see the competitors come in. Steinlager as the main sponsor had enabled scaffolding to be erected with a large banner at the finish line. Greg Dobson was the first individual man across the line, and he won the event; the first to break the 12-hour mark. Brian Sanders came second; the two had swapped places compared to 1985.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=53\u201363}} Jane Reeves, a radiographer from Christchurch, won the individual women's event; she had been leading her category from the start of the race.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=53\u201363, }}\n\n===1987 race===\nThe 1987 event was held on 7 and 8 February. New Zealand Breweries was the main sponsor, and they promoted their brand Steinlager through the race. The two-day event was entered by 143 individuals and 62 two-person teams. The two-day race has long been remembered for the crash involving 20 cyclists some {{convert|20|km}} into the race. [[1982 Commonwealth Games]] gold medallist cyclist [[Craig Adair]], who was establishing himself as a bike show owner at the time, was the event mechanic and he got cleaned out of spare parts by the crash. Terry Newlands from Auckland lost one of the sole from his shoes with an hour to go on the mountain run, and this slowed him down, but owing to a strong performance on the river, he won the men's two-day event. The fastest woman was Penny Webster, a teacher from [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=64\u201370}}\n\nBut what made the 1987 remarkable was the introduction of the \"Longest Day\"; the option for individual athletes to complete the event during a single day. There were 42 competitors who signed up: 40 men and 2 women. It was a gamble, as it was unknown whether humans could sustain the difficult conditions. There were other events that took a whole day to complete, most notably the [[Ironman World Championship]] that had been held on Hawaii since 1978, but none of these included such difficult conditions. Doctors were thus placed at the end of the mountain run, checking that the competitors were in a state that would allow them to continue, and none were pulled out of the field by the medical profession. The two women who entered had both previously won the two-day event: Stella Sweney in 1983 and 1984, and Jane Reeves in 1986. Reeves pulled out of the race in the kayaking section, and Sweney and her brother John stopped to rescue Reeves' kayak. The Sweney siblings were the last one-day competitors to cross the line in Sumner, but Stella Sweney added a third event title to her collection.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=64\u201370}}\n\nOf the Longest Day men, Eric Saggers was the first to finish the first bike section. He needed a good lead on Russell Prince, who was considered the stronger mountain runner, and Saggers had a lead of 2 min 29 sec. Prince overtook him up the Deception River close to Goat Pass and never saw another competitor. At Sumner, Prince had a 16-minute lead over John McKenzie, with a [[University of Canterbury]] student in third place \u2013 [[Steve Gurney]]. Saggers came fifth.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=64\u201370, 141}}\n\nRussell Prince had, literally, first come across the event in 1984. The heavy rain had forced him and his brothers out from a hunting trip at the headwaters of the Waimakariri River. Arriving back at the [[New Zealand State Highway 73|main road]] at Klondyke Corner, they saw a congregation of people and thought it must have been a large search and rescue party; they went over to offer their help. But they had walked into the overnight camp at the end of the mountain run, and one of the competitors explained to Prince what the event involved. Intrigued, Prince decided to participate the following year.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=43}} Prince came fifth in 1985,{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=135}} third in 1986,{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=135}} before winning the inaugural Longest Day in 1987.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=141}}\n\n===1988 race===\nFor the 1988 race, Judkins had set a limit of 400 competitors. He took delight in opening registrations in June of each year for the following event, and the places were snapped up within days. It was the first time that the event had sold out. New Zealand Breweries was again the main sponsor, and they promoted their brand Steinlager. For the first time, Judkins had celebrity entrants, with two former [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] putting their name forward: [[Brian Ford (rugby player)|Brian Ford]] and [[Kevin Eveleigh]]. [[John Jacoby]] entered the Longest Day after having come second in the 1987 team event with fellow Australian Andrew Maffett, who in 1988 was his support person. Jacoby had won the three previous World Cup [[canoe marathon]]s and was thus a top contender. Greg Dobson as the Longest Day race leader was five minutes ahead of Jacoby entering the river, but leaving the river, Jacoby had 14 minutes on Steve Gurney, who in turn had overtaken Dobson. Jacoby held this lead to Sumner in a time of 12:02:59 hours. He narrowly missed out on winning a [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]35,000 [[Ford Laser]] TX3 Turbo, which was the price for the first competitor to break the 12-hour mark.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=71\u201376}} In July 1988, Jacoby won the inaugural [[ICF canoe marathon|ICF canoe marathon World Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|title=First World Marathon Racing Championships|url=https://www.canoeicf.com/sites/default/files/1988_world_ch_nottingham_gbr.pdf|publisher=[[International Canoe Federation]]|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=24 July 1988}}</ref>\n\nThere was only one woman competing in the Longest Day, and she was there only because Judkins had talked her into it. Denise Higgison from [[Tauranga]] was the last individual to finish the Longest Day in a time of 17:22:08 hours, but this secured her the win in her category.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=73, 145}}\n\nThe two-day individual women's race was a competition between the 1987 winner, Penny Webster, and Claire Parkes. The deciding factor was a bad crash on her bike that cost Webster seven minutes, but that also injured her and reduced her performance. In the end, Parkes won 48 minutes ahead of Webster, who came in third place.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=73, 76, 145}} The individual men's two-day event was won by Daniel Forsyth.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=145}} Greg Coyle came last in the individual two-day event, with just over 23 hours, but for him, the important thing was to have done the race. He commented later: {{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=76}}\n\n{{Cquote|text=I sometimes go to the Cave Rock Hotel in [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]]. You're virtually a leper if you haven't done it. No one will talk to you, you've got nothing to talk about. It's as if you smell because you haven't done the Coast to Coast \u2013 it's like stigma. If you have, then it's like belonging to a funny kind of \u00e9lite.\n|author=Greg Coyle\n|source={{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=76}}}}\n\n===1989 race===\nA few things were new for the 1989, and some of them caused a furore. First of all, the New Zealand Tourism Department\u2014a government agency\u2014became involved as they recognised the potential for event tourism. They organised and funded foreign journalists to come and cover the event. One of those was English botanist [[David Bellamy]], who did not just report from the event, but decided to compete.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=77}} Another innovation was drug testing; this was Judkins' ploy to have the race known as the \"World Championship of Kayak, Cycle, Run\". In the end, it was the only event where drug testing was carried out, only the first three men of the Longest Day were required to give urine samples, and the samples were sent to [[Christchurch Hospital]] for testing of stimulants, rather than Canada for testing for [[anabolic steroid]]s as previously announced.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=77, 83}} Gurney and Prince, who had lobbied for drug testing, were critical of the scaled-back testing regime and claimed that some competitors were using steroids.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=83}} But the real controversy was caused by the sponsorship: New Zealand Breweries had decided to promote their South Island brand [[Speight's]], and it was their sexist slogan that caused the outcry: \"The stuff Southern Men are made of.\" Female competitors hissed and booed, and there was much discussion in the media, and media attention always pleased Judkins. People made their views known by slogans on the support vehicles. Gurney threatened to wear a dress if he managed to win the Longest Day. The brewery simply responded that their main target audience was men.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=77, 79}}\n\nIn the women's Longest Day event, Claire Parkes defeated Penny Webster. They had been neck to neck until the kayak section, where Webster pulled away.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=79}} Three competitors were well clear of the rest of the field in the men's Longest Day event; at the transition to the kayak, Prince had seven minutes on Gurney, who in turn had one minute on Jacoby. The latter shone in his specialist kayaking discipline and when leaving the river had a lead of four minutes on Gurney, and eighteen minutes on Prince. On the last cycling leg, Jacoby could even increase his lead, and he finished in 11:27:19 hours. Gurney and Prince also broke the 12-hour mark, but Jacoby had won the car (that year, a Suzuki was up for grabs) and a return trip to London. Gurney thus missed out on his chance to wear a dress during the prize-giving.\n\nIn the men's individual two-day category, Doug Lomax won the race. Lomax had been motivated to do well by somebody calling him fat, and he had slimmed down from {{convert|96|kg|st}} to {{convert|80|kg|st}} prior to the race. But in either case, this was just a test-run prior to the 1990 competition, where he intended to contest the Longest Day in the veteran's category, as he would have turned 40 by then.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=81f}} The individual women's category was won by Vivienne Prince, the wife of Russell Prince.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=56, 150}}<!-- \n\n===1992 race===\nThe sponsorship contribution of Speight's was NZ$500,000 this year.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=25}} Webster returned after a break during which she had a baby.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|p=79}} \n\n===2009 race===\nThe 2009 race was held on 13 and 14 February.<ref name=\"2009 The Year of The Woman\" />\n-->\n\n==Race results==\nThe following race results are for individuals competing either in the two-day (since 1983) or one-day (\"Longest Day\"; since 1987) event.{{sfn|McKerrow & Woods|1994|pp=133\u2013182}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Race Records |url=http://www.coasttocoast.co.nz/race-results/previous-race-results/race-records/ |publisher=Coast to Coast |accessdate=9 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Two-day results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=2| Year\n!colspan=3| Men\n!colspan=3| Women\n|-\n!

He marketed their reprint of the ''Century Dictionary'' using [[mail order]] and credit by installment terms, to great success. He visited [[England]] in 1897 and saw that the 9th edition of ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' could be marketed in the same way. He also noted that ''[[The Times]]'' suffered flagging sales, and hit on the idea of using the latter to market the former \u2014 to their mutual benefit.\n\nHe secured the reprint rights to ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and ''The Times'' reissued it.

He set about the production of the 11th edition which was published 1910-11. This was published in two blocks of volumes instead of the volumes appearing serially over a number of years.\n\nHooper established the ''Britannica Year-Book'', the first volume being published in 1913. He produced the ''Handy Volume'' edition (1915\u20131916) specifically for mail-order. This was a photographic reprint of the 11th edition, and was often sold with an accompanying book case.\n\n==Sale of ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''==\nHooper sold the copyright to [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] in 1920 but oversaw the publication in 1922 of the 12th edition - three volumes covering the events of [[World War I]] with a reprint of the eleventh edition.

Close at hand is a hermitage built by Sa'di himself, surrounded by a charming garden. It is situated near the source of the Ruknabad. In the garden Sheikh Sa'di constructed a number of basins for the washing of clothes. The citizens of Shiraz make parties of pleasure to this mausoleum; they eat food prepared in the hermitage, wash their garments in the river, and at sunset return to the town. So did I also.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

[[Breakfast cereals]] or [[muesli]] with milk, yogurt or [[filmj\u00f6lk]], currants, and fruits are popular or warm [[whole-grain]] porridge with milk and jam (for example [[lingonberry jam]]).<ref>Rutiga kokboken, 2002, {{ISBN|91-534-1950-2}}</ref> [[Bilberry]]-soup ([[bl\u00e5b\u00e4rssoppa]]) and [[rose hip soup]] are also possible breakfast alternatives.\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[Switzerland|Swiss]] breakfasts are often similar to those eaten in neighboring countries.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. The breakfast cereal [[Scott's Porage Oats]] was produced in [[Glasgow]] in 1880.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottsporage.co.uk/the-scotts-porage-story/our-heritage/#1|title=Scott's Porage \u2013 Our Heritage|publisher=Scott's Porage Oats|accessdate=19 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923232409/http://www.scottsporage.co.uk/the-scotts-porage-story/our-heritage/#1|archive-date=23 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before the arrival of American-style breakfast cereals in the early 20th century, dried bread soaked in hot milk or tea and porridge (boiled oats) was the common daily breakfast, while leftover vegetables (often, cabbage) and potatoes not eaten the night before were often served re-fried becoming '[[bubble and squeak|bubble-and-squeak]]';<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Caroline Conran, Traditional Cooking (British Cookery)1978 {{ISBN|0233 97053 3}}</ref> in [[Ireland]] the dish is known as [[colcannon]].

Black coffee or coffee with milk are traditional drinks. As this is the most common breakfast of the country, in [[Lim\u00f3n Province]] they prepare gallo pinto with coconut milk instead. Another popular breakfast food is the \"chorreadas\" which are savory sweetcorn pancakes; they are usually accompanied by cheese or a type of sour cream called \"natilla\".<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Costa Rica]]</ref>\n\n===Cuba===\nBreakfast in urban areas traditionally consists of [[caf\u00e9 con leche]] that is sweetened and includes a pinch of salt. Toasted buttered [[Cuban bread]], cut into lengths, is dunked in the coffee.

Normally accompanied by orange juice and other juices of fruits typical to the region. Milk punch (milk, egg, nutmeg, and malt) boiled eggs with \"harina de negrito\" or some other type of cornstarch. Traditional breakfast bread is a water-based bread.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Rep\u00fablica Dominicana]]</ref>\n\n===Guatemala===\nIn [[Guatemala]], breakfast consists of one or two eggs either fried, scrambled, or boiled accompanied by baked/fried beans with coffee. With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy).

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast. Thus there is no single standard Indian breakfast, with items changing with regions. However, one can broadly classify breakfast varieties in India into two types: North Indian and South Indian.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]]. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: ''[[hagelslag]]'' (chocolate sprinkles), ''[[Vlokken|chocoladevlokken]]'' (chocolate flakes) (both typically Dutch), and ''chocoladepasta ''([[chocolate spread]]).<ref name=\"wintle\">{{cite book|last=Wintle|first=Michael|editor=Thomas M.

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

The usual one is the same as in the rest of Spain: coffee with milk or [[Cola Cao]], orange juice, biscuits or toasts, with butter and jam.\n\nIn the North, East and West it is more common to have a cup of coffee (usually with milk) or [[Cola Cao]] and a toast with a choice of [[olive oil]] and salt, [[tomato]] and olive oil, [[butter]], jam, p\u00e2t\u00e9, ''[[jam\u00f3n serrano]]'' (cured ham), and other options like ''[[Sobrassada|sobrasada]]'' (a raw cured spiced sausage that is easy to spread),<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref> and in [[Andalucia]], ''[[pring\u00e1]]''. Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals.

In the United States, 65% of coffee is drunk during breakfast hours.<ref name=\"eimportz\">{{cite web |title=Specialty Coffee Statistics |publisher=e-importz.com |accessdate=25 March 2012 |url=http://www.e-importz.com/Support/specialty_coffee.htm}}</ref> Milk is also widely consumed, drunk either plain or prepared with various flavorings, such as chocolate or strawberry.\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\n[[File:Vegemiteontoast large.jpg|right|thumb|Toast with [[vegemite]]]]\nPrior to the Second World War and the widespread adoption of household refrigerators, the traditional Australian breakfast consisted of grilled steaks and fried eggs, mainly because of the ready availability of beefsteak during that period.

It was originally released in 1999 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and is now also available for [[macOS]], [[FreeBSD]], [[AmigaOS 4]]{{r|AMIGA}}, [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]], [[MorphOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]]{{r|NETBSDREF}} and [[OpenBSD]].{{r|OPENBSDREF}}\n\nWhile {{em|Warzone 2100}} was developed and released as a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Commercial software|commercial]] [[video game]], on December 6, 2004, the [[source code]] and most of its data was released under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2;{{r|GPL2#1}} the rest of the data followed on June 10, 2008.\n\n== Story ==\nIn the late 21st century, the world's civilizations are wiped out by a series of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] strikes, seemingly caused by a massive malfunction of the new NASDA (North American Strategic Defense Agency) strategic [[Defense (military)|defense]] system. While most of the survivors form scavenger bands to survive, the player is a member of a group named \"The Project\", that is more organised and seeks to rebuild civilization using pre-war technology.\n\nThe game begins with The Project sending three teams (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) to gather technology that would help with reconstruction; the player assumes command of Team Alpha in [[Arizona]]. While gathering said \"artifacts\", the Project fends off attacks from an organization called the New Paradigm, another major survivalist organisation, which is more advanced than the player's forces. Later however, it is discovered that a self-aware [[computer virus]] named 'Nexus' is actually controlling the New Paradigm.\n\nAfter the player defeats the New Paradigm, he is assigned to Team Beta, which is based in Chicago and under attack by a faction called 'The Collective'. Again, the player starts out less advanced than 'The Collective' and it is discovered that Nexus is controlling this faction too. At the end of the campaign, Nexus launches nuclear missiles at Alpha and Beta bases, prompting the player to abandon the facility and move to the Gamma base.\n\nUpon arriving at Gamma base, the player is immediately ambushed by the Gamma forces, which have already been taken over by Nexus. After the player survives the ambush and develops countermeasures to 'Nexus' infection, Nexus takes control of the remaining NASDA satellites and attempts to destroy the player. However, before he can succeed, the Project captures a NASDA missile site, and shoots down the orbiting laser weapons. It is learned that the scientist Dr. Reed, who was bankrupted by the US military, transformed himself into the Nexus [[computer virus|virus]] and was responsible for the [[nuclear holocaust]] by infiltrating the 'NASDA' systems. At this point, the survivors of the Alpha and Beta bases arrive, and the three Project teams launch a full-scale assault on Nexus. The Project destroys Nexus and can begin rebuilding civilization.\n\n[[File:WZ2100BASEANDUNITS.jpg|left|thumb|A base and some units in {{em|Warzone 2100}} campaign mode (2019)]]\n\n[[File:WZ2100BASEONLY.jpg|left|thumb|{{em|Warzone 2100}} build 3.2.3 - campaign mode (2019)]]\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:War Zone 2100 - Dropship cinematic.png|thumb|Videos frequently appear during gameplay. This image depicts a dropship transporting the player's forces towards the campaign's first Away mission.]]\n\nThe game is fully 3D, based on the iViS 3D graphics engine developed by Sam Kerbeck of Eidos Interactive The game world is mapped by a grid; vehicles tilt to meet hilly terrain, and projectiles can be realistically blocked by steep mountains or buildings. The camera is free-moving and can zoom in and out, rotate, and pan up or down while navigating the battlefield.\n\nIn the game, units of different factions are painted different colors. The New Paradigm, the Collective, and Nexus are the enemies of the Project in the campaign, and they can be seen attacking Project forces as well as Scavengers, survivors of the nuclear fallout.\n\nUnits can all be customized according to: chassis (which, for example, takes weight and power into account); drive system (such as wheels or tracks); and mounted object (such as a weapon, or one of various support tools). Units can earn experience. Earning experience cause units to level up from ranks such as Rookie to Trained and Professional.\n\n{{em|Warzone 2100}} places an emphasis on sensors and radar to detect units and to coordinate ground attacks. Counter-battery sensors detect enemy artillery by sensing their projectiles and firing arcs and pinpointing their location to coordinate artillery strikes against enemy artillery. VTOL ([[Vertical Take-Off and Landing]]) sensors work like basic sensors, only they coordinate VTOL airstrikes. VTOL counter-battery sensors coordinate VTOLs to find and destroy enemy artillery batteries.\n\nThere is an emphasis on artillery: although many direct- and close-combat weapons and anti-air weapons can be researched and deployed, artillery is a staple of assault on enemy bases and outposts. While the technology tree is clearly defined and consistent, it never appears in-game and, therefore, the player can be left guessing as to what technology is next in the tree. Technology can be acquired by gathering artifacts left behind by certain destroyed enemy structures or units. Researching is composed of largely small and incremental advancements over existing weapons, armor, and chassis types.\n\nSome levels require you to achieve the objective within a time limit whilst some without these limits can be used to gather \"power\". In Away missions, the player must select a limited group of units to transport to a territory completely removed from the original base.\n\nAll of the terrain throughout the campaign is essentially composed of three areas, with different sectors for Away missions and other such levels; upon progression, previous maps simply expand and the player's original bases from past levels are maintained. Also, its resource system is quite different from mainstream RTS games; Oil Derricks are established over specific, scarce locations which constantly provide a slow, fixed rate of income. Combined with a mission time limit, this resource method makes it generally infeasible for players to utilize certain traditional RTS tactics such as \"turtling\" (fortifying one or more bases against enemy attack, while stockpiling resources with which to produce a massive army).\n\nHowever, there are certain missions throughout the game that do not have a time limit, and in these missions it is possible to use more traditional RTS tactics to prepare for subsequent timed missions.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n[[File:War Zone 2100 - Mortars.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of an older build of the game from 2008 - Mobile [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] weapons bombard Scavenger-occupied shacks from afar.]]\n\n[[File:Warzone 2100 - EditWorld - 1.jpg|thumb|{{em|Warzone 2100}} map editor (EditWorld)]]\n\n[[File:Warzone 2100 - EditWorld - 2.jpg|thumb|{{em|Warzone 2100}} map editor (EditWorld)]]\n\n== History ==\n{{em|Warzone 2100}} was originally developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by [[Eidos Interactive]]. In 1999 it was originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. After having released patch 1.10 final in November 1999, Pumpkin Studios ended their support for Warzone 2100}} at January 5, 2000.{{r|PUMPKIN}} On March 15, 2000, Pumpkin Studios was closed down by Eidos Interactive. Pumpkin Studios later reformed as [[Pivotal Games]].\n\n=== End of support and fan patch ===\nAfter the [[End-of-life (product)|official support ended]] with the dissolution of Pumpkin Studios, a third-party group of game enthusiasts, N.E.W.S.T., tried to continue the support in October 1999. Starting in November 2000, the group released [[unofficial patch]]es which fixed many of the game's remaining problems. In February 2003 Pumpkin-2, the renamed N.E.W.S.T. group{{r|PUMPKIN2}}, sent a petition{{r|PUMPKIN2}}{{r|PETITION}} to copyright holder Eidos Interactive, asking for permission to get and use the [[source code]] and art content.\n\n=== Open sourcing ===\nOn December 6, 2004 ''Warzone's'' source code was uploaded to Radiosity's [[FTP server]] by Alex McLean of [[Pivotal Games]].{{r|SOURCECODE}} Source code and artwork (beside the movies) of ''Warzone'' were placed under the [[GPLv2]] license, making the game [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]].{{r|GPL2#2}} On June 10, 2008 the license of the game was clarified; distribution of movies and soundtrack was now permitted, too.{{r|MOVIES}}\n\n=== Community driven development ===\nFollowing the release, the game's community started a revival project, based on the available source code and assets: originally called \"Warzone Re-Development Project\", it was later renamed to the \"Warzone 2100 Resurrection Project\", and then to the \"Warzone 2100 Project\". On June 11, 2005, version 0.1 of the \"Warzone 2100 Project\" was released, with all [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] technology replaced by free and open-source alternatives. As of 2019 the community development continues. On February 18, 2020 Warzone 2100 was released on the Steam gaming platform as a completely free product. \n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1241950/Warzone_2100/|title=Warzone 2100 on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{em|[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]}} reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"It all adds up to a surprisingly mature RTS game that will keep you coming back.\"{{r|NG55}}\n\n{{em|Warzone 2100}} was generally well received amongst reviewers, with the PC version receiving an average of 81% from [[GameRankings]], and the PlayStation version an average of 76%.{{r|GAMERANKINGS}}\n\n{{em|[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]}} reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"As it is, {{em|Warzone 2100}} for PlayStation is practically the definition of shuffleware.\"{{r|NG56}}\n\n[[GameSpot]] gave the PlayStation version a 6.5, and the PC version a 7.6. GameSpot praised the game for its high level of customizability and concluded, \"{{em|Warzone 2100's}} highly navigable 3D engine, unique campaign structure, and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gameplay should please most real-time strategy fans.\"{{r|GAMESPOT#1}}{{r|GAMESPOT#2}}\n\n[[IGN]] shared similar sentiments, rating the PC version 8.0, and the PlayStation version 7.5. IGN praised the PlayStation version for being one of the few RTS games on the system, \"In the end the weird truth is that {{em|Warzone 2100}} is one of the best RTS on the system.\"{{r|IGN#1}} In their PC review, the author expressed disappointment with the lack of innovation, but praised it nonetheless, \"Mostly it boils down to taking great ideas found in other RTS titles and combining them into one. Pumpkin Studios did a fantastic job with that task and this one is certainly worth playing all the way through.\"{{r|IGN#2}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Video games|Free and open-source software|Amiga}}\n* [[List of free PC games]]\n* [[List of open-source video games]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=3.3.0>{{cite web |url = https://forums.wz2100.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=15647 |title = Release 3.3.0 -

Combined with a mission time limit, this resource method makes it generally infeasible for players to utilize certain traditional RTS tactics such as \"turtling\" (fortifying one or more bases against enemy attack, while stockpiling resources with which to produce a massive army).\n\nHowever, there are certain missions throughout the game that do not have a time limit, and in these missions it is possible to use more traditional RTS tactics to prepare for subsequent timed missions.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n[[File:War Zone 2100 - Mortars.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of an older build of the game from 2008 - Mobile [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] weapons bombard Scavenger-occupied shacks from afar.]]\n\n[[File:Warzone 2100 - EditWorld - 1.jpg|thumb|{{em|Warzone 2100}} map editor (EditWorld)]]\n\n[[File:Warzone 2100 - EditWorld - 2.jpg|thumb|{{em|Warzone 2100}} map editor (EditWorld)]]\n\n== History ==\n{{em|Warzone 2100}} was originally developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by [[Eidos Interactive]]. In 1999 it was originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. After having released patch 1.10 final in November 1999, Pumpkin Studios ended their support for Warzone 2100}} at January 5, 2000.{{r|PUMPKIN}} On March 15, 2000, Pumpkin Studios was closed down by Eidos Interactive. Pumpkin Studios later reformed as [[Pivotal Games]].\n\n=== End of support and fan patch ===\nAfter the [[End-of-life (product)|official support ended]] with the dissolution of Pumpkin Studios, a third-party group of game enthusiasts, N.E.W.S.T., tried to continue the support in October 1999. Starting in November 2000, the group released [[unofficial patch]]es which fixed many of the game's remaining problems. In February 2003 Pumpkin-2, the renamed N.E.W.S.T. group{{r|PUMPKIN2}}, sent a petition{{r|PUMPKIN2}}{{r|PETITION}} to copyright holder Eidos Interactive, asking for permission to get and use the [[source code]] and art content.\n\n=== Open sourcing ===\nOn December 6, 2004 ''Warzone's'' source code was uploaded to Radiosity's [[FTP server]] by Alex McLean of [[Pivotal Games]].{{r|SOURCECODE}} Source code and artwork (beside the movies) of ''Warzone'' were placed under the [[GPLv2]] license, making the game [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]].{{r|GPL2#2}} On June 10, 2008 the license of the game was clarified; distribution of movies and soundtrack was now permitted, too.{{r|MOVIES}}\n\n=== Community driven development ===\nFollowing the release, the game's community started a revival project, based on the available source code and assets: originally called \"Warzone Re-Development Project\", it was later renamed to the \"Warzone 2100 Resurrection Project\", and then to the \"Warzone 2100 Project\". On June 11, 2005, version 0.1 of the \"Warzone 2100 Project\" was released, with all [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] technology replaced by free and open-source alternatives. As of 2019 the community development continues.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{em|[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]}} reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"It all adds up to a surprisingly mature RTS game that will keep you coming back.\"{{r|NG55}}\n\n{{em|Warzone 2100}} was generally well received amongst reviewers, with the PC version receiving an average of 81% from [[GameRankings]], and the PlayStation version an average of 76%.{{r|GAMERANKINGS}}\n\n{{em|[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]}} reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"As it is, {{em|Warzone 2100}} for PlayStation is practically the definition of shuffleware.\"{{r|NG56}}\n\n[[GameSpot]] gave the PlayStation version a 6.5, and the PC version a 7.6. GameSpot praised the game for its high level of customizability and concluded, \"{{em|Warzone 2100's}} highly navigable 3D engine, unique campaign structure, and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gameplay should please most real-time strategy fans.\"{{r|GAMESPOT#1}}{{r|GAMESPOT#2}}\n\n[[IGN]] shared similar sentiments, rating the PC version 8.0, and the PlayStation version 7.5. IGN praised the PlayStation version for being one of the few RTS games on the system, \"In the end the weird truth is that {{em|Warzone 2100}} is one of the best RTS on the system.\"{{r|IGN#1}} In their PC review, the author expressed disappointment with the lack of innovation, but praised it nonetheless, \"Mostly it boils down to taking great ideas found in other RTS titles and combining them into one. Pumpkin Studios did a fantastic job with that task and this one is certainly worth playing all the way through.\"{{r|IGN#2}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Video games|Free and open-source software|Amiga}}\n* [[List of free PC games]]\n* [[List of open-source video games]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=3.3.0>{{cite web |url = https://forums.wz2100.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=15647 |title = Release 3.3.0 - Warzone 2100 Forums |date = 2019-08-31 |website = wz2100.net |language = en |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190901020657/https://forums.wz2100.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=15647 |archive-date = 2019-09-01 |url-status = live |access-date = 2019-10-13 |ref = 3.3.0 |df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n<ref name=NETBSDREF>{{cite web|url=http://pkgsrc.se/games/warzone2100|title=The NetBSD package collection|website=pkgsrc.se|publisher=www.netbsd.se|accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=OPENBSDREF>{{cite web|url=http://openports.se/games/warzone2100|website=OpenPorts.se|title=OpenPorts.se {{!}} The OpenBSD package collection|publisher=www.netbsd.se|accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=AMIGA>{{cite web|url=https://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5745|title=Warzone 2100 for AmigaOS4|publisher=AmigaWorld.net|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=GPL2#1>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/blob/master/COPYING|title=warzone2100/COPYING|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=PUMPKIN>{{cite web|url=http://www.pivotalgames.com/pumpkin/News/News.html|title=Pumpkin Studios announcing the discontinuation of Warzone 2100|date=January 5, 2000|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=PUMPKIN2>{{cite web|url=http://www.duckandcover.cx/archives.php?id=7770|title=Warzone 2100 petition;
