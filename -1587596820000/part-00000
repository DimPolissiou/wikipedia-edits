superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together two magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing Ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

The bulk of Kabila's fighters were Tutsis, and many were veterans of various conflicts in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]] of Africa. Kabila himself had credibility as a long-time political opponent of Mobutu, and had been a follower of [[Patrice Lumumba]] (the first Prime Minister of the independent Congo), who was executed by a combination of internal and external forces in January 1961, and was ultimately replaced by Mobutu in 1965.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, ''The African Dream''</ref> Kabila had declared himself a [[Marxist]] and an admirer of [[Mao Zedong]].

The people most alarmed by this order were the Banyamulenge Tutsi of eastern Congo.

A quick intervention of a number of other African states attempted to help the DRC in countering the rebel offense. As rebel forces were pushed back, it appeared for a time that an escalation in the conflict to a conventional war among multiple national armies loomed. Such an outcome was avoided as battle lines stabilized in 1999. After that, the conflict was fought for much of the time by [[irregular military|irregular proxy forces]], with little change in the territories held by the various parties.\n\nOn 2 August 1998, the Banyamulenge in Goma erupted into rebellion. Rwanda offered them immediate assistance, and early in August a well-armed rebel group, the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD)\u2014composed primarily of Banyamulenge and backed by Rwanda and Uganda\u2014emerged. This group quickly came to dominate the resource-rich eastern provinces, and based its operations in Goma. The RCD quickly took control of the towns of [[Bukavu]] and [[Uvira]] in the [[Kivu]]s. The Tutsi-led Rwandan government allied with Uganda, and Burundi also retaliated, occupying a portion of northeastern Congo. To help remove the occupying Rwandans, President Kabila enlisted the aid of refugee Hutus in eastern Congo and began to agitate public opinion against the Tutsis, resulting in several public [[lynching]]s in the streets of Kinshasa.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clark|first=John Frank|title=The African stakes of the Congo War|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=978-1-4039-8244-5|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=128|oclc=647537048}}</ref> On 12 August a loyalist army major broadcast a message urging resistance from a radio station in [[Bunia]] in eastern Congo: \"People must bring a machete, a spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric irons, barbed wire, stones, and the like, in order, dear listeners, to kill the Rwandan Tutsis.\"<ref name=\"BBC hate messages\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/149901.stm Hate messages on East Congolese radio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821035615/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/149901.stm |date=21 August 2006 }}, [[BBC News]], 12 August 1998</ref>\n\nThe Rwandan government also challenged current borders by claiming a substantial part of eastern Congo as \"historically Rwandan\". The Rwandans alleged that Kabila was organising a [[genocide]] against their Tutsi brethren in the [[Kivu]] region.

Even as rebel forces advanced on Kinshasa, government forces continued to battle for control of towns in the east of the country. The Hutu militants with whom Kabila was co-operating were also a significant force in the east. Nevertheless, the fall of the capital and of Kabila, who had spent the previous weeks desperately seeking support from various African nations and [[Cuba]], seemed increasingly certain. The rebel offensive was abruptly reversed as Kabila's diplomatic efforts bore fruit. The first African countries to respond to Kabila's request for help were fellow members of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). While officially the SADC members are bound to a mutual defence treaty in the case of outside aggression, many member nations took a neutral stance to the conflict. However, the governments of [[Namibia]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Angola]] supported the Kabila government after a meeting in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe, on 19 August.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/1998/08/disarmament-sadc-moves-into-unknown-territory/|title=DISARMAMENT: SADC Moves Into Unknown Territory {{!}} Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> Several more nations joined the conflict for Kabila in the following weeks: [[Chad]], [[Libya]] and [[Sudan]].\n\nA multisided war thus began.

This intervention by various nations saved the Kabila government and pushed the rebel front lines away from the capital. However, it was unable to defeat the rebel forces, and the advance threatened to escalate into direct conflict with the national armies of Uganda and Rwanda. In November 1998 a new Ugandan-backed rebel group, the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]], was reported in the north of the country.

The Agreement obliges the parties to carry out a plan to reunify the country, disarm and integrate the warring parties and hold elections. There were numerous problems, resulting in continued instability in much of the country and a delay in the scheduled national elections from June 2005 to July 2006.\n\nThe main cause for the continued weakness of the Transitional Government is the refusal by the former warring parties to give up power to a centralised and neutral national administration. Some belligerents maintained administrative and military [[Command and Control (Military)|command-and-control]] structures separate from that of the Transitional Government, but as the [[International Crisis Group]] has reported, these have gradually been reduced. A high level of official corruption siphoning money away from civil servants, soldiers and infrastructure projects causes further instability.\n\nOn 30 July 2006 the first elections were held in the DRC after the populace approved a new constitution.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/world/africa/31congo.html|title=Congo Holds First Multiparty Election in 46 Years|date=2006-07-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A second round was held on 30 October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/tc/accept?origin=%2Fstable%2Fpdf%2Fresrep12240.pdf%3Frefreqid%3Dexcelsior%3A6d5382f90864cee356e06dc54806c9ba&is_image=False|title=Accept Terms and Conditions on JSTOR|last=Carayannis|first=Tatiana|date=2008|website=www.jstor.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n{{History of the DRC}}\n\n===Areas of continuing conflict===\n[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|250px|Meeting of victims of [[Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]\nThe fragility of the state has allowed continued violence and human rights abuses in the east. There are three significant centres of conflict:\n* North and South Kivu, where a weakened FDLR continues to threaten the Rwandan border and the [[Banyamulenge]], where Rwanda supports [[RCD-Goma]] rebels against Kinshasa (see [[Kivu conflict]]), and where local conflicts continue to fuel violence;\n* [[Ituri Province|Ituri]], where MONUC / MONUSCO has proved unable to contain the numerous militia and groups driving the [[Ituri conflict]];\n* Northern [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], where [[Mai-Mai]] Militias slipped out of the control of Kinshasa (see [[Katanga insurgency]]).\n\nThe ethnic violence between [[Hutu]]- and [[Tutsi]]-aligned forces has been a driving impetus for much of the conflict, with people on both sides fearing their annihilation. The [[Kinshasa]]- and Hutu-aligned forces enjoyed close relations as their interests in expelling the armies and proxy forces of Uganda and Rwanda dovetail.\n\nWhile the Uganda- and Rwanda-aligned forces worked closely together to gain territory at the expense of Kinshasa, competition over access to resources created a fissure in their relationship. There were reports that Uganda permitted Kinshasa to send arms to the Hutu FDLR via territory held by Uganda-backed rebels as Uganda, Kinshasa and the Hutus are all seeking, in varying degrees, to check the influence of Rwanda and its affiliates.\n\n===Rwanda and Ugandan backing of rebels===\nRwanda backed rebels due to fears of Hutu rebels on its border. The Kinshasa government was suspicious of Kigali's influence over the region, as Rwanda has occupied the area numerous times and some witnesses confirm that Rwanda has profited from the looting of Congolese minerals. Consequently, Rwanda supports the [[Kivu conflict|continuing rebellion of General Nkunda]] in Congo. The DRC wants assurance that Kigali aligned forces have no conflict-mineral or territorial interests in eastern Congo.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/congo/story/0,,2161241,00.html |title=Fear of fresh conflict in Congo as renegade general turns guns on government forces |author=Chris McGreal |work=The Guardian |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2007 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 December 2005 the United Nations [[International Court of Justice]] ruled that the DRC's sovereignty had been violated by Uganda, and that DRC had lost billions of dollars worth of resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=19 December 2005|title=Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo|url=https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/116/116-20051219-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf|journal=International Court of Justice|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The DRC government has asked for $10 billion in compensation. Though the ICJ has taken many steps to ensure that war crimes and crimes against humanity will be prosecuted, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank rewarded both Uganda and Rwanda with debt relief packages for improving their economic health during a time when much of their increased revenue was partially a direct result of illegally importing conflicted minerals from the DRC. In this case, international institutions such as the IMF and WB are allegedly at odds with international laws and charters. Both the IMF and WB have been accused of helping to facilitate the conflict in the DRC by rewarding combatants.<ref>Mullins, Christopher, and Roth, Dawn. \"Gold, Diamonds and Blood: International State-corporate Crime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\" ''Contemporary Justice Review'' 11.2 (2008): 81\u201399.

It states that of the IRC's five periodic estimates, two that cover a period from 1998-2001 are flawed, and the reported 2.6 million deaths within should not be included in the total death toll. The other three periodic IRC estimates cover a period from May 2001-April 2007, and in which 2.83 million of the total 5.4 million deaths were reported. The HSRP argued that the estimates were built on a general death rate that was far too low for Congo, and that most of those people would have most likely died anyway. Thus, the IRC figure should be revised to 860,000 total war-related excess deaths.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Security Report 2009: The Shrinking Costs of War |url=http://www.humansecurityreport.info/2009Report/2009Report_Complete.pdf |publisher=[[Human Security Report Project]] at the School for International Studies, [[Simon Fraser University]] |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010 |page=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224110035/http://www.humansecurityreport.info/2009Report/2009Report_Complete.pdf |archive-date=24 December 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Michael Spagat, Andrew Mack, Tara Cooper and Joakim Kreutz, [http://ns425.cawebhosting.com/docs/Publications/Additional-Publications/Spagat-Mack-JConflict-Resolution-EstimatingWarDeaths.pdf \"Estimating War Deaths: An Arena of Contestation,\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524193639/http://ns425.cawebhosting.com/docs/Publications/Additional-Publications/Spagat-Mack-JConflict-Resolution-EstimatingWarDeaths.pdf |date=24 May 2013 }} ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', (2009); 53; 934\u2013950.</ref>\n\nIn response to the criticism from HSRP, one of the authors of the IRC report argued the following: Although there may have been small statistical discrepancies in the original study, the IRC report had been widely peer-reviewed and was judged to be an accurate estimate of the war-related excess deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=DR Congo war deaths 'exaggerated' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8471147.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121025213/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8471147.stm |archive-date=21 January 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dongo conflict]], 2009 conflict in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] \n* [[List of wars by death toll]]\n* ''[[Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders]]'' \u2013 documentary film about the work of [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] in DR Congo\n* [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baregu, Mwesiga. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606221524/http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/political%20science/volume7n2/ajps007002003.pdf The Clones of 'Mr. Kurtz': Violence, War and Plunder in the DRC].\" () ''[[African Journal of Political Science]]''.

As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, the player explore the Oldest House \u2013 the FBC's paranormal headquarters \u2013 and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. Throughout the game, the player gains new abilities by finding Objects of Power, mundane objects like a rotary phone or a floppy disc imbued with energies from another dimension, that have been at the center of major paranormal events and since recovered by the FBC. \n \n''Control'' is inspired by the fictional [[SCP Foundation]], an online project of user-created stories of paranormal objects, and based on the genre of the [[new weird]]. The environments of the Oldest House are designed in the [[brutalist architecture]], common for many oppressive governmental buildings and which also served as a good setting to show off the game's destructive environmental systems. ''Control'' was one of the first games released to take advantage of real-time [[ray tracing]] built into newer [[video card]]s.\n\nUpon release, ''Control'' was met with positive reviews from critics and consumers alike, with several gaming publications naming it among their top games of 2019. The game was also nominated for numerous video game awards, winning several related to the game's art and design. ''Control'' was followed by a downloadable expansion, ''The Foundation'', which was released on March 26, 2020. A second expansion, ''AWE'', is scheduled for release in mid-2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Control'' is played from a [[third-person perspective]], and is built using Remedy's proprietary Northlight Engine, which was first used on the company's previous title ''[[Quantum Break]]''. As Jesse Faden, players wield the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can be adapted into a variety of different forms with different combat applications.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Remedy's Control Only Has One Gun.

The Service Weapon has limited ammunition which reloads after a certain interval and Jesse's abilities expend Jesse's energy, necessitating a balance in their usage. The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers.The Service Weapon is a gun that can transform into 5 different forms: Grip, Spin, Shatter, Pierce, Charge. players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House.

These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

''Control'' was released on 27 August 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, the player explore the Oldest House \u2013 the FBC's paranormal headquarters \u2013 and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. Throughout the game, the player gains new abilities by finding Objects of Power, mundane objects like a rotary phone or a floppy disc embued with energies from another dimension that have been at the center of major paranormal events and since recovered by the FBC. \n \n''Control'' is inspired by the fictional [[SCP Foundation]], an online project of user-created stories of paranormal objects, and based on the genre of the [[new weird]]. The environments of the Oldest House are designed in the [[brutalist architecture]], common for many oppressive governmental buildings and which also served as a good setting to show off the game's destructive environmental systems. ''Control'' was one of the first games released to take advantage of real-time [[ray tracing]] built into newer [[video card]]s.\n\nUpon release, ''Control'' was met with positive reviews from critics and consumers alike, with several gaming publications naming it among their top games of 2019. The game was also nominated for numerous video game awards, winning several related to the game's art and design. ''Control'' was followed by a downloadable expansion, ''The Foundation'', which was released on March 26, 2020. A second expansion, ''AWE'', is scheduled for release in mid-2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Control'' is played from a [[third-person perspective]], and is built using Remedy's proprietary Northlight Engine, which was first used on the company's previous title ''[[Quantum Break]]''. As Jesse Faden, players wield the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can be adapted into a variety of different forms with different combat applications.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Remedy's Control Only Has One Gun.

The Service Weapon has limited ammunition which reloads after a certain interval and Jesse's abilities expend Jesse's energy, necessitating a balance in their usage. The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers.The Service Weapon is a gun that can transform into 5 different forms: Grip, Spin, Shatter, Pierce, Charge. players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House. Due to the versatility of the game's loadouts, ''Control''{{'}}s combat system can be customized and balanced to each player's personal preferences.<ref name=\"gameinformer.com\">{{cite web |last1=Shea |first1=Brian |title=A Look At Every Supernatural Ability In Remedy's Control |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/08/a-look-at-every-supernatural-ability-in-remedys-control |website=Game Informer}}</ref> Health in ''Control'' does not recharge automatically, and must be picked up from fallen enemies.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=@bacon_sandwich |number=1106796905244344321 |date=15 March 2019 |title=I think you\u2019ll be happy to learn in Control, player health does not regenerate automatically.

The Oldest House's interior is far larger than its exterior, an enormous, constantly shifting supernatural realm that defies the laws of [[spacetime]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shea |first1=Brian |title=Uncovering The Mysteries Of Control's The Oldest House |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/15/uncovering-the-mysteries-of-controls-the-oldest-house |website=Game Informer |accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref> ''Control'' is built in the [[Metroidvania]] format, with a large world map that can be explored at a nonlinear pace, unlike Remedy's previous titles, which were primarily linear. As the player unlocks new abilities and clearance throughout the game, new areas of the Oldest House can be explored, opening various side-quests. Certain areas known as Control Points can be used to fast travel throughout the building after they have been cleared of enemies.

They range from standard humans carrying firearms to heavily mutated variations which possess a variety of superpowers. Some of Jesse's abilities allow her to seize control of enemies' minds temporarily, turning them into her allies, and allowing their abilities to be used for the player's benefit.<ref name=\"gameinformer.com\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Control'' revolves around a clandestine U.S. government agency known as the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), which is responsible for the investigation of \"paranatural\" phenomena which defy the known laws of reality. These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

One euro would provide a credit of 130 won. This card can be used for instance at the famous [[Pyongyang Department Store No. 1]] or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes. In normal stores and markets goods are priced in what has been called the 'untied' won or free market rate and regular banknotes can be used here. At for instance the [[Tongil Market]] and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 10,000 won for one euro (2012) to locals and foreign visitors alike, so almost 77 times as much as the tied rate. However, the prices in the normal shops outside the tied won and restricted state shops are also based on this untied won rate.<ref>Black Market cash: the real value of N.

These coins were often restruck with the original dates in later years; however, 1970 and 1974 dates also appear on the 1 and 5 chon. In 1978, 50 chon coins featuring the [[Chollima Statue]] and a rising sun were introduced into circulation during the 1979 currency reform to allow greater flexibility for vendors by eliminating the 50 chon banknote and large amounts of \"small change\" coinage carried. In 1987, 1 won coins featuring the [[Grand People's Study House]] were introduced, but did not fully replace the 1 won note which remained legal tender.\n\nWhen the historic 2.16 peg to the dollar was abandoned in 2001 to allow for greater [[convertibility]] the coins began to lose value. After 2003, these coins were rarely seen in circulation but were still redeemable. Later, a new set of coins was introduced in 2005 in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These coins were less impressive compared to the older series, being very plain and generic in design. All circulation coins of the Second Won were struck in aluminum.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Circulated coins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"2\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"4\"| Date of minted year\n|-\n!

Issued in 1983, these coins were part of the \"Pakkundon\" convertible series. Coins with no \"stars\" were for general circulation in North Korea, coins marked with one star were for \"socialist visitors\", and coins marked with two stars were designated for \"capitalist visitors\". A fourth set, intended for collectors rather than circulation, was struck with the word \"specimen\" or \"example\" in Korean characters in the areas where the stars would be. The specimen/example set is the least common of the four. Besides the general circulating coins, there is an abundance of different commemorative coins minted in the name of the DPRK. Most, if not all of them, are sold to foreign [[numismatist]]s. Some of these are official, state approved coins, others are not.\n\n=== Third Won ===\nCoins were issued in 10, 50 chon and 1 won denominations in 2002 and 1 and 5 chon denominations in 2008. All denominations are struck in aluminum. These coins feature the national coat of arms on the obverse and flowers, particularly the [[Kimjongilia]] and the [[Kimilsungia]], on the reverse of the 10 and 50 chon. A magnolia adorns the 1 won.<ref name=\"dnk412\" />\n\nInitially struck in 2002, the coins were intended for use shortly after the dollar peg was removed from the currency. The 50 chon and 1 won were smaller than the previous designs, while the new 10 chon was the same size as the old. Hyperinflation became a very sudden reality, however, and the new coins were never released as planned. In 2008, 1 and 5 chon coins were also struck when a plan for monetary revaluation began. The coins were finally released into circulation in December 2009 but due to the flawed nature of the revaluation these coins again carry very little value, with especially the 1 and 5 chon being virtually irrelevant.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Circulated coins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"3\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!rowspan=\"2\"| Date of minted year\n|-\n!

These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 won. These were discontinued shortly after Soviet forces withdrew and recognized the newly independent state.\n\n=== First Won ===\nThis currency was issued in all banknote form, with the first banknotes of this issue in denominations of 15, 20, and 50 chon along with 1, 5, 10 and 100 won in 1947. The chon notes had stylized art designs while the won denominations were fairly uniform in design featuring a farmer and a worker standing together and holding the symbolic tools. This currency was later revalued in 1959 at a rate of one new won to 100 old won to fix the inflation that had occurred as a result of the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|title=DPRK Economy|last=Schuler|first=Kurt|year=2004|publisher=Tables of Modern Monetary Systems|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301194517/http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|archivedate=2010-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Second Won ===\nIn 1959, the old won was replaced with the Second Won, with price and exchange rates fixed to the U.S. dollar. This banknote series was issued in denominations of 50 chon, and 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These notes were much larger than the previous issue and depicted images representing various industries in the North Korean economy.\n\nIn 1979, the currency was again reformed, and a new banknote series was issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. There is ongoing speculation as to why this move was made. All 1959 banknotes were removed from circulation. Circulating coins, however, were not affected by this change. The designs for this issue were much more symbolic and charismatic than previous ones, with Kim Il-sung featuring for the first time on the 100 won note.\n\nIn 1992, another redesign was carried out for banknotes, again in denominations of 1-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-won. Older notes were once again withdrawn. These notes were smaller and crisper than the previous issue and depicted more modern themes. The 5 and 10 won banknotes were again issued in 1998, along with a 500 won banknote that same year but were stamped rather than engraved reflecting poorer production quality. In 2002, 1,000 and 5,000 won notes were introduced, followed by a 200 won note in 2005. The former two were identical in design to the 100 won though differing in colors and added security features, but the colored fields behind the text no longer extended all the way to the margins. In 2007, the 500 won had also been revised in this same manner along with being engraved for the first time to protect against counterfeiting. From 1998 onwards, all notes were dated using the [[North Korean calendar|Juche year]] (Juche year) along with the standard dating.\n\nIn 2005, the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued commemorative 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 won notes to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea. It consists of an overprint on its regular issue notes.\n\nIn 2007, a commemorative version of this banknote series was released, stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 95th Birthday\" on all denominations.\n\nAs explained above, there are two varieties of foreign certificates. For the 1978 banknote series, foreign certificates, called \"Pakkundon\", meaning \"exchangeable money\" were implemented by an overstamp and serial number color. This was intended to protect the value of the national currency in North Korea's [[command economy]]. These were first released in 1983 in two forms, one for \"socialist visitors\" which had a red stamp, and one for \"capitalist visitors\" which had a green stamp. Another series was released in 1986 with either a blue or red [[Guilloch\u00e9]] style stamp. These were issued in all denominations, except for the \u20a9100 note, presumably because it was assumed by the government that foreign visitors to North Korea would not show proper respect for its depiction of Kim Il-sung. These notes were discontinued in 1988 and replaced with a new series of Pakkundon in all banknote form that was more distinguishable and unmistakable from generic circulation currency.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Banknotes of the North Korean won (1978 issue)\n|-\n!

Unlike previous reforms, the 2009 move sparked a nationwide panic when it was announced there would be a two-week waiting period between the withdrawal of the old currency and the introduction of the new currency, coupled with an exchange limit of only 500,000 old won for each person, effectively wiping out savings. The state eventually pulled back on most exchange limits; however, the revaluation proved to be a failure.\n\nLike the coins for this series, some of the denominations were initially printed in 2002 but were never released into circulation, pointing to a planned monetary revaluation much earlier than 2009 that was never carried out.\n\nThe current series of banknotes of the third won are issued in denominations of 5-, 10-, 50-, 100-, 200-, 500-, 1,000-, 2,000-, and 5,000-won. [[Kim Il-sung]] is depicted only on the obverse of the highest denomination, with the 100 won note featuring the [[Magnolia]] (National Flower) and other notes depicting North Koreans of different professions and various monuments in North Korea.<ref name=\"dnk412\" /> The exchange rate was 100 second won to 1 third won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten online|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|last=GmbH|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike all previous series, these notes were all uniform in dimensions rather than staggered in size from smallest to largest. There are rumors that the original designs for the 1,000 and 2,000 won notes depicted Kim Il-sung and had similar design features to the 5,000 won that were scrapped and destroyed due to counterfeiters or thieves breaking into a bank warehouse and stealing early notes or printing materials, resulting in a total redesign of the two denominations in question.\n\nIn 2012, another commemorative series of banknotes was released, this time in the 2002\u20132009 series but similarly stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 100th Birthday.\" Once again this stamp appeared on all denominations.<ref>[http://banknotenews.com/files/20a77c7620cccd7435f61161b2077912-2930.php North Korea new 100th birthday commemorative notes confirmed] BanknoteNews.com.

One euro would provide a credit of 130 won. This card can be used for instance at the famous [[Pyongyang Department Store No. 1]] or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes. In normal stores and markets goods are priced in what has been called the 'untied' won or free market rate and regular banknotes can be used here. At for instance the [[Tongil Market]] and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 10,000 won for one euro (2012) to locals and foreign visitors alike, so almost 77 times as much as the tied rate. However, the prices in the normal shops outside the tied won and restricted state shops are also based on this untied won rate.<ref>Black Market cash: the real value of N.

These coins were often restruck with the original dates in later years; however, 1970 and 1974 dates also appear on the 1 and 5 chon. In 1978, 50 chon coins featuring the [[Chollima Statue]] and a rising sun were introduced into circulation during the 1979 currency reform to allow greater flexibility for vendors by eliminating the 50 chon banknote and large amounts of \"small change\" coinage carried. In 1987, 1 won coins featuring the [[Grand People's Study House]] were introduced, but did not fully replace the 1 won note which remained legal tender.\n\nWhen the historic 2.16 peg to the dollar was abandoned in 2001 to allow for greater [[convertibility]] the coins began to lose value. After 2003, these coins were rarely seen in circulation but were still redeemable. Later, a new set of coins was introduced in 2005 in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These coins were less impressive compared to the older series, being very plain and generic in design. All circulation coins of the Second Won were struck in aluminum.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Circulated coins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"2\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"4\"| Date of minted year\n|-\n!

Issued in 1983, these coins were part of the \"Pakkundon\" convertible series. Coins with no \"stars\" were for general circulation in North Korea, coins marked with one star were for \"socialist visitors\", and coins marked with two stars were designated for \"capitalist visitors\". A fourth set, intended for collectors rather than circulation, was struck with the word \"specimen\" or \"example\" in Korean characters in the areas where the stars would be. The specimen/example set is the least common of the four. Besides the general circulating coins, there is an abundance of different commemorative coins minted in the name of the DPRK. Most, if not all of them, are sold to foreign [[numismatist]]s. Some of these are official, state approved coins, others are not.\n\n=== Third Won ===\nCoins were issued in 10, 50 chon and 1 won denominations in 2002 and 1 and 5 chon denominations in 2008. All denominations are struck in aluminum. These coins feature the national coat of arms on the obverse and flowers, particularly the [[Kimjongilia]] and the [[Kimilsungia]], on the reverse of the 10 and 50 chon. A magnolia adorns the 1 won.<ref name=\"dnk412\" />\n\nInitially struck in 2002, the coins were intended for use shortly after the dollar peg was removed from the currency. The 50 chon and 1 won were smaller than the previous designs, while the new 10 chon was the same size as the old. Hyperinflation became a very sudden reality, however, and the new coins were never released as planned. In 2008, 1 and 5 chon coins were also struck when a plan for monetary revaluation began. The coins were finally released into circulation in December 2009 but due to the flawed nature of the revaluation these coins again carry very little value, with especially the 1 and 5 chon being virtually irrelevant.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Circulated coins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"3\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!rowspan=\"2\"| Date of minted year\n|-\n!

These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 won. These were discontinued shortly after Soviet forces withdrew and recognized the newly independent state.\n\n=== First Won ===\nThis currency was issued in all banknote form, with the first banknotes of this issue in denominations of 15, 20, and 50 chon along with 1, 5, 10 and 100 won in 1947. The chon notes had stylized art designs while the won denominations were fairly uniform in design featuring a farmer and a worker standing together and holding the symbolic tools. This currency was later revalued in 1959 at a rate of one new won to 100 old won to fix the inflation that had occurred as a result of the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|title=DPRK Economy|last=Schuler|first=Kurt|year=2004|publisher=Tables of Modern Monetary Systems|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301194517/http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|archivedate=2010-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Second Won ===\nIn 1959, the old won was replaced with the Second Won, with price and exchange rates fixed to the U.S. dollar. This banknote series was issued in denominations of 50 chon, and 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These notes were much larger than the previous issue and depicted images representing various industries in the North Korean economy.\n\nIn 1979, the currency was again reformed, and a new banknote series was issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. There is ongoing speculation as to why this move was made. All 1959 banknotes were removed from circulation. Circulating coins, however, were not affected by this change. The designs for this issue were much more symbolic and charismatic than previous ones, with Kim Il-sung featuring for the first time on the 100 won note.\n\nIn 1992, another redesign was carried out for banknotes, again in denominations of 1-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-won. Older notes were once again withdrawn. These notes were smaller and crisper than the previous issue and depicted more modern themes. The 5 and 10 won banknotes were again issued in 1998, along with a 500 won banknote that same year but were stamped rather than engraved reflecting poorer production quality. In 2002, 1,000 and 5,000 won notes were introduced, followed by a 200 won note in 2005. The former two were identical in design to the 100 won though differing in colors and added security features, but the colored fields behind the text no longer extended all the way to the margins. In 2007, the 500 won had also been revised in this same manner along with being engraved for the first time to protect against counterfeiting. From 1998 onwards, all notes were dated using the [[North Korean calendar|Juche year]] (Juche year) along with the standard dating.\n\nIn 2005, the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued commemorative 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 won notes to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea. It consists of an overprint on its regular issue notes.\n\nIn 2007, a commemorative version of this banknote series was released, stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 95th Birthday\" on all denominations.\n\nAs explained above, there are two varieties of foreign certificates. For the 1978 banknote series, foreign certificates, called \"Pakkundon\", meaning \"exchangeable money\" were implemented by an overstamp and serial number color. This was intended to protect the value of the national currency in North Korea's [[command economy]]. These were first released in 1983 in two forms, one for \"socialist visitors\" which had a red stamp, and one for \"capitalist visitors\" which had a green stamp. Another series was released in 1986 with either a blue or red [[Guilloch\u00e9]] style stamp. These were issued in all denominations, except for the \u20a9100 note, presumably because it was assumed by the government that foreign visitors to North Korea would not show proper respect for its depiction of Kim Il-sung. These notes were discontinued in 1988 and replaced with a new series of Pakkundon in all banknote form that was more distinguishable and unmistakable from generic circulation currency.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Banknotes of the North Korean won (1978 issue)\n|-\n!

Unlike previous reforms, the 2009 move sparked a nationwide panic when it was announced there would be a two-week waiting period between the withdrawal of the old currency and the introduction of the new currency, coupled with an exchange limit of only 500,000 old won for each person, effectively wiping out savings. The state eventually pulled back on most exchange limits; however, the revaluation proved to be a failure.\n\nLike the coins for this series, some of the denominations were initially printed in 2002 but were never released into circulation, pointing to a planned monetary revaluation much earlier than 2009 that was never carried out.\n\nThe current series of banknotes of the third won are issued in denominations of 5-, 10-, 50-, 100-, 200-, 500-, 1,000-, 2,000-, and 5,000-won. [[Kim Il-sung]] is depicted only on the obverse of the highest denomination, with the 100 won note featuring the [[Magnolia]] (National Flower) and other notes depicting North Koreans of different professions and various monuments in North Korea.<ref name=\"dnk412\" /> The exchange rate was 100 second won to 1 third won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten online|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|last=GmbH|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike all previous series, these notes were all uniform in dimensions rather than staggered in size from smallest to largest. There are rumors that the original designs for the 1,000 and 2,000 won notes depicted Kim Il-sung and had similar design features to the 5,000 won that were scrapped and destroyed due to counterfeiters or thieves breaking into a bank warehouse and stealing early notes or printing materials, resulting in a total redesign of the two denominations in question.\n\nIn 2012, another commemorative series of banknotes was released, this time in the 2002\u20132009 series but similarly stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 100th Birthday.\" Once again this stamp appeared on all denominations.<ref>[http://banknotenews.com/files/20a77c7620cccd7435f61161b2077912-2930.php North Korea new 100th birthday commemorative notes confirmed] BanknoteNews.com.

Instead of depicting the portrait of North Korea's founder Kim Il-sung, the note depicts an image of his birthplace in Mangyondae and on the back the [[International Friendship Exhibition]] in [[Myohyangsan]] that displays gifts he and his son Kim Jong-il received from foreign leaders.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2014/08/11/2014081100747.html N.Korea Drops Kim Il-sung from New Banknotes] The Chosun Ilbo (english.chosun.com).
