[[Andr\u00e9s Bello]] a Venezuelan poet and humanist, formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on November 19, 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe foundation answered the need to modernize the country which a little more than two decades before had become independent from Spain. It replaced the Real Universidad de San Felipe, which was established in 1738.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe University was formally opened on September 17, 1843. During this period, the university consisted of five faculties (facultades): '''Humanities & Philosophy''', '''Physical & Mathematical Sciences''', '''Law & Political Sciences''', '''Medicine''', and '''Theology'''. During its first years the University gave considerable support to education, institutional organization (such as the \"Civil Code\", a model for America), the building of the road network to join together the territory, and the energy and production infrastructure.\n\nBy 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy & Education Sciences, Legal & Social Sciences, Biology & Medical Sciences, Physical & Mathematical Sciences, Agronomy & Veterinary, and Fine Arts.\n\nThe institution has also contributed to the formation of the intellectual elites and leaders of the country. Most of the Chilean presidents have studied in its lecture halls, as well as people with prominent roles in politics, business and culture.\n\n=== Major reforms during the military regime of 1973\u20131989 ===\n\nDuring [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On October 2, 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated that the University's presidents would be designated by the military regime.<ref>[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-58112004001500015&script=sci_arttext Jorge Baeza Correa, Referencias para un an\u00e1lisis del discurso del gobierno militar chileno sobre el movimiento estudiantil universitario: 1973\u20131980.

Some faculties, such as the one located in avenida Portugal and which now belongs to the Universidad Mayor, were privatized and sold at bargain prices to Pinochet cronies.\n\nThese changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the dictatorship as a way to moderate the University's influence on the nation's politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements, considered leftist by Augusto Pinochet and other right-wing government officials.\n\nIn spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains Chile's most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n== Organization ==\nThe university's community involves the collaboration of academics, students and staff, who perform the tasks that establish its mission and functions.\n\n===Government===\n* '''President''' (''Rector'')''':''' Highest authority and legal representative.

[[Andr\u00e9s Bello]] a Venezuelan poet and humanist, formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on November 19, 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe foundation answered the need to modernize the country which a little more than two decades before had become independent from Spain. It replaced the Real Universidad de San Felipe, which was established in 1738.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe University was formally opened on September 17, 1843. During this period, the university consisted of five faculties (facultades): '''Humanities & Philosophy''', '''Physical & Mathematical Sciences''', '''Law & Political Sciences''', '''Medicine''', and '''Theology'''. During its first years the University gave considerable support to education, institutional organization (such as the \"Civil Code\", a model for America), the building of the road network to join together the territory, and the energy and production infrastructure.\n\nBy 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy & Education Sciences, Legal & Social Sciences, Biology & Medical Sciences, Physical & Mathematical Sciences, Agronomy & Veterinary, and Fine Arts.\n\nThe institution has also contributed to the formation of the intellectual elites and leaders of the country. Most of the Chilean presidents have studied in its lecture halls, as well as people with prominent roles in politics, business and culture.\n\n=== Major reforms during the military regime of 1973\u20131989 ===\n\nDuring [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On October 2, 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated that the University's presidents would be designated by the military regime.<ref>[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-58112004001500015&script=sci_arttext Jorge Baeza Correa, Referencias para un an\u00e1lisis del discurso del gobierno militar chileno sobre el movimiento estudiantil universitario: 1973\u20131980.

Some faculties, such as the one located in avenida Portugal and which now belongs to the Universidad Mayor, were privatized and sold at bargain prices to Pinochet cronies.\n\nThese changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the dictatorship as a way to moderate the University's influence on the nation's politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements, considered leftist by Augusto Pinochet and other right-wing government officials.\n\nIn spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains Chile's most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n== Organization ==\nThe university's community involves the collaboration of academics, students and staff, who perform the tasks that establish its mission and functions.\n\n===Government===\n* '''President''' (''Rector'')''':''' Highest authority and legal representative.

It was first broadcast in 1995, and was animated by [[Alfonso Productions]], a Spanish animation studio also responsible for animating ''[[Count Duckula]]'', ''[[Victor and Hugo: Bunglers in Crime]]'' and ''[[Avenger Penguins]]'', [[Milimetros]], another Spanish animation studio, and in-house by Cosgrove Hall themselves. It aired largely on [[Children's ITV]]. The series also had a run on [[Pop (UK TV channel)|Pop]] from 2003 to 2005. It was the first Cosgrove Hall cartoon to be animated with a process called [[Cambridge Animation Systems|Animo]], wherein the animation drawings were scanned and then digitally coloured on computers. The first series was produced and directed by [[Ben Turner (producer)|Ben Turner]], while the second one was produced and directed by its creator, Andy Roper.\n\n==Influences==\nThe main character of Fantomcat was influenced heavily by ''[[Zorro]]'', [[Errol Flynn]] and ''[[Fant\u00f4mas]]'', and the series itself was influenced by ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and the time-lost approach of both ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.\n\n==Details==\n''Fantomcat'' centres on the character Phillipe L'Entrique Elan de Chanel, Count Givenchy and Duke of Fantom, a.k.a. Fantomcat, a masked [[swashbuckling]] hero who thrived on the stormy evening of 31 December 1699 in mortal combat with his nemesis Baron von Skelter, a sword-wielding caped Skeletoid alchemist. But Von Skelter was not alone in Castle Fantom, as he had brought with him two of his henchmen. During the battle, Phillipe was treacherously cast into a painting within the halls of his home, Castle Fantom, by Von Skelter's henchmen with the Crystal of Malevolence, a stone so powerful that it can change worlds. As his clock struck midnight, he became trapped in the painting for three centuries while Von Skelter stole his Ring of the Fantoms and his sword, Touch\u00e9. \n\nAs time passed, the area around Castle Fantom became a bustling metropolis called Metrocity, a city submerged in crime rings led by the fiendish arachnid Marmagora. Eventually, at midnight on 31 December 1999, Fantomcat is freed from the painting by the members of the Wildcat Detective Agency when they take a wrong turning into the castle while chasing two explosive-wielding reptiles.\n\nOn 1 January 2000, Fantomcat joins the Wildcat Detective Agency in their battle against Marmagora and her henchmen, who have used another Crystal of Malevolence to summon Baron von Skelter into the modern day and join her as her partner in a new world order. Fantomcat and the Wildcat Detective Agency defeat Marmagora's henchmen, and blow up Baron Von Skelter with the two Crystals of Malevolence. Although the Baron has been defeated, Marmagora is still hanging around, and the battle will continue another day.\n\n==Characters==\n*Phillipe L'Entrique Elan de Chanel, Count Givenchy and Duke of Fantom (voiced by [[Robert Powell]]) - The main protagonist of the series. A masked, swashbuckling, polite and fearless hero who joins the Wildcat Detective Agency after his release and is nicknamed Fantomcat. Fantomcat is naturally completely oblivious to the modern world and its various new technologies, which can hinder him and the detective team if not careful. Fantomcat has a sword called Touch\u00e9 which can respond to his beck and call, has been with him all his nine lives, and was made from the same metal that his great grandfather's sword was made from. He can also turn invisible with the help of his Ring of the Fantoms, a ring a thousand years old whose powers have helped Fantomcat's family oppose evil down the ages. With this ring, he can act like a \"Phantom\" when needed. In-between adventures, he teaches MacDuff how to be a swordsman.\n*Sir Randolph L'Entrique Elan de Chanel (voiced by [[Robert Powell]]) - Fantomcat's father, who is now deceased. He often appears in the form of a ghost whenever Fantomcat has lost a battle or lost one of his nine lives.\n*Great Grandfather L'Entrique Elan de Chanel (voiced by [[Robert Powell]]) - Fantomcat's great grandfather, who was killed by Nemesis during their first and final encounter. Like Fantomcat's father, he appeared to Fantomcat in the form of a ghost.\n*Tabitha \"Tabs\" Wildcat (voiced by [[Lorelei King]]) - A stern female detective and leader of the Wildcat Detective Agency, who has a crush on Fantomcat. Her younger sister is Ginger Wildcat, the head of the New York Police Department who also has a crush on Fantomcat. She is known as Penelope \"Penny\" Wildcat in some foreign dubs.\n*MacDuff the Mouse (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - A timid member of the Detective Team, who hates holes. His real name is Claude, though as it embarrasses him, he prefers to be called MacDuff. He is also a swordsman-in-training.\n*Bunty the Mouse (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - MacDuff's older brother, who is an inept inventor. He has a habit of calling MacDuff by his real name, which irritates him.\n*Leandra Bagshot (voiced by [[Lorelei King]]) - MacDuff's girlfriend, who is unaware of his life as a detective thwarting Marmagora.\n*Lindbergh the Pigeon (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - A member of the Detective Team who talks in garbled, blubbering language, hates heights and therefore will not fly.\n*Police Chief Axel Schmiere (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - The chief of the Metrocity Police Department, who enjoys eating hamburgers and is scared of Fantomcat.\n*Hiram \"Big\" Bucks (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - Metrocity's biggest billionaire, who owns every industrial business in the city.\n*The Mayor (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - The mayor of Metrocity, who is rather geeky and cowardly, and often works alongside Hiram \"Big\" Bucks.\n*Rash Blackhead (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - A reporter for Metrocity News Flash who is a big fan of Fantomcat and the Wildcat Detective Agency.\n*Marmagora (voiced by [[Lorelei King]]) - The primary antagonist of the series. A hideous giant widow spider intent on dominating Metrocity and leader of the evil forces below the city. She has a pet carnivorous plant called Gloria, who takes three weeks to digest her food, and she often feeds her henchman Vile the Bluebottle to her whenever he messes up.\n*Vile the Bluebottle (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - A fly. Marmagora's right-hand man, who does not help her much but only follows her instructions and agrees with everything she says - however, he sometimes has feelings against Marmagora. He normally wields a gun or a sword, and like all flies, can fly.\n*Vinnie the Vole (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - One of Marmagora's henchmen, who is always ready to help. Unlike Vile, Vinnie is actually quite smart, but he always gets shunned by Vile.\n*Vomit the Fly (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - Vile's cousin. He is also Marmagora's \"spy in the sky fly\", and is a lot smaller than Vile.\n*The Crab Twins (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]] and [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - Two of Marmagora's second division boys, called Jack and Arthur. They normally wield crowbars and baseball bats, and often target rich people. They are also very good swimmers.\n*Baron Hugo von Skelter (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - A sword-wielding caped Skeletoid alchemist who imprisoned Fantomcat for 300 years and was summoned to the present day by Marmagora to finish his heinous conquest. He was formerly a bison scientist, but after experimenting alchemy on himself, he became a Skeletoid set upon the path of evil. He was thought dead after being defeated by Fantomcat in the first episode, but he survived and is now waiting for his revenge on him.\n*The Monitor (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - An intergalactic space villain who talks like [[Shere Khan]] and destroys planets with a giant laser on his asteroid spaceship. He was thought dead after being sucked out into space in his first appearance, but he survived as he can breathe in space and is now waiting for his revenge on Fantomcat. \n*Lurk (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - One of the Monitor's henchmen, who is a Cockney lizard. He's not much help, \n*Nemesis (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - A demon warrior created by a powerful sorcerer in order to wipe out Fantomcat's great grandfather and ravage the land. He was defeated, but at the cost of Fantomcat's great grandfather's life. He is again summoned by Marmagora in the form of a [[Sodium]]-filled giant robot, and is again defeated with a water cannon. He is fought by MacDuff when Fantomcat ends up in a radiation accident, and once again by MacDuff when Blaine Bunion accidentally summons him. He can be summoned with the incantation \"Galiostro acapelto maponos asmodeos azazel!\"\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Series 1===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"99%\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n!width=\"1%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Episode No.\n!width=\"2%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Title\n!width=\"3%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Villains\n!width=\"1%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Directed by\n!width=\"2%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Written by\n!width=\"2%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n|Title=The Hero Returns\n|Aux1=Marmagora and Baron von Skelter\n|DirectedBy=Ben Turner\n|WrittenBy=Keith Smith\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|7 September 1995}}\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|ShortSummary=While chasing two explosive-wielding reptiles, the Wildcat Detective Agency is launched into Castle Fantom where Tabs accidentally frees Fantomcat from a portrait.

It was first broadcast in 1995, and was animated by [[Alfonso Productions]], a Spanish animation studio also responsible for animating ''[[Count Duckula]]'', ''[[Victor and Hugo: Bunglers in Crime]]'' and ''[[Avenger Penguins]]'', [[Milimetros]], another Spanish animation studio, and in-house by Cosgrove Hall themselves. It aired largely on [[Children's ITV]]. The series also had a run on [[Pop (UK TV channel)|Pop]] from 2003 to 2005. It was the first Cosgrove Hall cartoon to be animated with a process called [[Cambridge Animation Systems|Animo]], wherein the animation drawings were scanned and then digitally coloured on computers. The first series was produced and directed by [[Ben Turner (producer)|Ben Turner]], while the second one was produced and directed by its creator, Andy Roper.\n\n==Influences==\nThe main character of Fantomcat was influenced heavily by ''[[Zorro]]'', [[Errol Flynn]] and ''[[Fant\u00f4mas]]'', and the series itself was influenced by ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and the time-lost approach of both ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.\n\n==Details==\n''Fantomcat'' centres on the character Phillipe L'Entrique Elan de Chanel, Count Givenchy and Duke of Fantom, a.k.a. Fantomcat, a masked [[swashbuckling]] hero who thrived on the stormy evening of 31 December 1699 in mortal combat with his nemesis Baron von Skelter, a sword-wielding caped Skeletoid alchemist. But Von Skelter was not alone in Castle Fantom, as he had brought with him two of his henchmen. During the battle, Phillipe was treacherously cast into a painting within the halls of his home, Castle Fantom, by Von Skelter's henchmen with the Crystal of Malevolence, a stone so powerful that it can change worlds. As his clock struck midnight, he became trapped in the painting for three centuries while Von Skelter stole his Ring of the Fantoms and his sword, Touch\u00e9. \n\nAs time passed, the area around Castle Fantom became a bustling metropolis called Metrocity, a city submerged in crime rings led by the fiendish arachnid Marmagora. Eventually, at midnight on 31 December 1999, Fantomcat is freed from the painting by the members of the Wildcat Detective Agency when they take a wrong turning into the castle while chasing two explosive-wielding reptiles.\n\nOn 1 January 2000, Fantomcat joins the Wildcat Detective Agency in their battle against Marmagora and her henchmen, who have used another Crystal of Malevolence to summon Baron von Skelter into the modern day and join her as her partner in a new world order. Fantomcat and the Wildcat Detective Agency defeat Marmagora's henchmen, and blow up Baron Von Skelter with the two Crystals of Malevolence. Although the Baron has been defeated, Marmagora is still hanging around, and the battle will continue another day.\n\n==Characters==\n*Phillipe L'Entrique Elan de Chanel, Count Givenchy and Duke of Fantom (voiced by [[Robert Powell]]) - The main protagonist of the series. A masked, swashbuckling, polite and fearless hero who joins the Wildcat Detective Agency after his release and is nicknamed Fantomcat. Fantomcat is naturally completely oblivious to the modern world and its various new technologies, which can hinder him and the detective team if not careful. Fantomcat has a sword called Touch\u00e9 which can respond to his beck and call, has been with him all his nine lives, and was made from the same metal that his great grandfather's sword was made from. He can also turn invisible with the help of his Ring of the Fantoms, a ring a thousand years old whose powers have helped Fantomcat's family oppose evil down the ages. With this ring, he can act like a \"Phantom\" when needed. In-between adventures, he teaches MacDuff how to be a swordsman.\n*Sir Randolph L'Entrique Elan de Chanel (voiced by [[Robert Powell]]) - Fantomcat's father, who is now deceased. He often appears in the form of a ghost whenever Fantomcat has lost a battle or lost one of his nine lives.\n*Great Grandfather L'Entrique Elan de Chanel (voiced by [[Robert Powell]]) - Fantomcat's great grandfather, who was killed by Nemesis during their first and final encounter. Like Fantomcat's father, he appeared to Fantomcat in the form of a ghost.\n*Tabitha \"Tabs\" Wildcat (voiced by [[Lorelei King]]) - A stern female detective and leader of the Wildcat Detective Agency, who has a crush on Fantomcat. Her younger sister is Ginger Wildcat, the head of the New York Police Department who also has a crush on Fantomcat. She is known as Penelope \"Penny\" Wildcat in some foreign dubs.\n*MacDuff the Mouse (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - A timid member of the Detective Team, who hates holes. His real name is Claude, though as it embarrasses him, he prefers to be called MacDuff. He is also a swordsman-in-training.\n*Bunty the Mouse (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - MacDuff's older brother, who is an inept inventor. He has a habit of calling MacDuff by his real name, which irritates him.\n*Leandra Bagshot (voiced by [[Lorelei King]]) - MacDuff's girlfriend, who is unaware of his life as a detective thwarting Marmagora.\n*Lindbergh the Pigeon (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - A member of the Detective Team who talks in garbled, blubbering language, hates heights and therefore will not fly.\n*Police Chief Axel Schmiere (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - The chief of the Metrocity Police Department, who enjoys eating hamburgers and is scared of Fantomcat.\n*Hiram \"Big\" Bucks (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - Metrocity's biggest billionaire, who owns every industrial business in the city.\n*The Mayor (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - The mayor of Metrocity, who is rather geeky and cowardly, and often works alongside Hiram \"Big\" Bucks.\n*Rash Blackhead (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - A reporter for Metrocity News Flash who is a big fan of Fantomcat and the Wildcat Detective Agency.\n*Marmagora (voiced by [[Lorelei King]]) - The primary antagonist of the series. A hideous giant widow spider intent on dominating Metrocity and leader of the evil forces below the city. She has a pet carnivorous plant called Gloria, who takes three weeks to digest her food, and she often feeds her henchman Vile the Bluebottle to her whenever he messes up.\n*Vile the Bluebottle (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - A fly. Marmagora's right-hand man, who does not help her much but only follows her instructions and agrees with everything she says - however, he sometimes has feelings against Marmagora. He normally wields a gun or a sword, and like all flies, can fly.\n*Vinnie the Vole (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - One of Marmagora's henchmen, who is always ready to help. Unlike Vile, Vinnie is actually quite smart, but he always gets shunned by Vile.\n*Vomit the Fly (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - Vile's cousin. He is also Marmagora's \"spy in the sky fly\", and is a lot smaller than Vile.\n*The Crab Twins (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]] and [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - Two of Marmagora's second division boys, called Jack and Arthur. They normally wield crowbars and baseball bats, and often target rich people. They are also very good swimmers.\n*Baron Hugo von Skelter (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - A sword-wielding caped Skeletoid alchemist who imprisoned Fantomcat for 300 years and was summoned to the present day by Marmagora to finish his heinous conquest. He was formerly a bison scientist, but after experimenting alchemy on himself, he became a Skeletoid set upon the path of evil. He was thought dead after being defeated by Fantomcat in the first episode, but he survived and is now waiting for his revenge on him.\n*The Monitor (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - An intergalactic space villain who talks like [[Shere Khan]] and destroys planets with a giant laser on his asteroid spaceship. He was thought dead after being sucked out into space in his first appearance, but he survived as he can breathe in space and is now waiting for his revenge on Fantomcat. \n*Lurk (voiced by [[Jimmy Hibbert]]) - One of the Monitor's henchmen, who is a Cockney lizard. He's not much help, \n*Nemesis (voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]]) - A demon warrior created by a powerful sorcerer in order to wipe out Fantomcat's great grandfather and ravage the land. He was defeated, but at the cost of Fantomcat's great grandfather's life. He is again summoned by Marmagora in the form of a [[Sodium]]-filled giant robot, and is again defeated with a water cannon. He is fought by MacDuff when Fantomcat ends up in a radiation accident, and once again by MacDuff when Blaine Bunion accidentally summons him. He can be summoned with the incantation \"Galiostro acapelto maponos asmodeos azazel!\"\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Series 1===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"99%\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n!width=\"1%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Episode No.\n!width=\"2%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Title\n!width=\"3%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Villains\n!width=\"1%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Directed by\n!width=\"2%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Written by\n!width=\"2%\" style=\"background:#6A4794;\"|Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n|Title=The Hero Returns\n|Aux1=Marmagora and Baron von Skelter\n|DirectedBy=Ben Turner\n|WrittenBy=Keith Smith\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|7 September 1995}}\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|ShortSummary=While chasing two explosive-wielding reptiles, the Wildcat Detective Agency is launched into Castle Fantom where Tabs accidentally frees Fantomcat from a portrait.
