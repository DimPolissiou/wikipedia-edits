As soon as she finished high school she married a man that her parents picked out for her. After the birth of her daughter and two years into the marriage she left her husband and came back to live with her parents with her daughter.\n\nShe always loved acting even as a child she imagined playing roles and now with most of her close friends involved in the Touring Amateur Theatre in Sobor, she began seriously considering it as a career. Although the theatre company included some of her relatives, Milka's parents initially disapproved of her choice of profession. At that time, acting was not generally accepted by everyone as a respectable profession, though a change was beginning to take place. Milka made her first amateur acting debut with the Sombor touring theatre company in early 1862. Her premiere was a success although she felt she needed to learn more about acting and the theatre. That same year she enrolled at a Women's College in Belgrade where she attended classes in literature and drama.{{sfn|\u0422\u043e\u043c\u0438\u045b|2014|pp=178}}\n\nIn 1864, Milka won her first professional success as ''Ljubica'' in Matija Ban's ''Mejrima''. This brought her to the attention of [[Jovan \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], who immediately signed her up as a member of the [[National Theatre in Belgrade]].

As soon as she finished high school she married a man that her parents picked out for her. After the birth of her daughter and two years into the marriage she left her husband and came back to live with her parents with her daughter.\n\nShe always loved acting even as a child she imagined playing roles and now with most of her close friends involved in the Touring Amateur Theatre in Sobor, she began seriously considering it as a career. Although the theatre company included some of her relatives, Milka's parents initially disapproved of her choice of profession. At that time, acting was not generally accepted by everyone as a respectable profession, though a change was beginning to take place. Milka made her first amateur acting debut with the Sombor touring theatre company in early 1862. Her premiere was a success although she felt she needed to learn more about acting and the theatre. That same year she enrolled at a Women's College in Belgrade where she attended classes in literature and drama.{{sfn|\u0422\u043e\u043c\u0438\u045b|2014|pp=178}}\n\nIn 1864, Milka won her first professional success as ''Ljubica'' in Matija Ban's ''Mejrima''.

He was taken to [[Accra]] where he continued his education at the Labadi Presbyterian Junior School starting in class 3. He was unable to speak the [[Ga language]] which was his mother tongue, however, he could read and write [[Twi]], and speak [[Dangme]]. He continued in the [[Labadi]] Presbyterian\u00a0Senior School until 1933 when he got to Standard Six. In March 1933 he won a scholarship to study at Christ Church Grammar School, a private secondary school which was on the point of winding up. He returned to the Labadi Presbyterian Senior School after a month at Christ Church Grammar School because he did not like the school.<ref name=\"OA\"/> \n\nHis father was then persuaded to send him to the [[Accra Academy]], then a private secondary school trying to find its feet through the help of enterprising young men. In April 1933 he entered the Accra Academy and he liked it there. He walked four miles from Labadi to [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] (where the school was then situated), because he could not afford the bus fare which was about [[Two\u00a0pence\u00a0(British decimal coin)|two pence]]. In 1934 he sat for the Junior Cambridge examination and passed it. While at the Accra Academy, he found difficulty in meeting the cost of books, however, a member of the staff, Mr.\u00a0Halm Addo (one of the four founders of the school), used to help him with money for\u00a0books. In December, 1936 he was one of the candidates presented by the Accra Academy for the Cambridge Senior School leaving Certificate Examination. Among the candidates who passed the examination, only two obtained exemption from the London Matriculation Examination Board. One of these students was Ako Adjei.<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\nHe taught for a while in 1937 before joining the Junior Civil Service in June 1937. From June 1937 to December 1938 he was a Second Division Clerk in the Gold Coast Civil Service. He was assigned to assist Harold Cooper, a European Assistant Colonial Secretary, and [[J. E. S. de Graft-Hayford]] to organise and establish the [[Gold Coast Broadcasting Service]]. These were the beginnings of what is now the [[Ghana Broadcasting Corporation]].<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\nWhile studying at the Accra Academy Ako Adjei had taken an interest in journalism, he wrote for [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]]'s ''African Morning Post''. Azikiwe also took an interest  in him and arranged for him to study at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[USA]]. In November 1938 he resigned from the Civil Service and left for [[England]] in December that year.<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\n===United States of America===\nIn January 1939, he arrived at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], [[Pennsylvania]] to the welcome of K.A.B. Jones-Quartey, a student from the Gold Coast whom Ako Adjei had know due to his work with the ''Accra Morning Post''. Jones-Quartey had been accompanied to welcome him by another Gold Coast student who was introduced as Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah ([[Kwame Nkrumah]]). At Lincoln University he was housed at Houston Hall. He registered for courses in Political Science, Economics, Sociology, English, Latin and Philosophy.<ref name=\":chinebuah\"/>\n \nAko Adjei shared the same room at Houston Hall with Jones-Quartey and their room was opposite Nkrumah's room, which was larger in size due to Nkrumah being a postgraduate student. Ako Adjei formed a close relationship with [[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]] despite the age gap that apparently existed between them. Together with a group of students, they often had long heated discussions (known as bull sessions) about the emancipation of African countries from colonial domination. Among the African students who regularly took part in these discussions were Jones-Quartey, [[K. O.\u00a0Mbadiwe|Ozuomba Mbadiwe]], [[Nwafor Orizu]] and [[Ikechukwu Ikejiani]].<ref name=\":chinebuah\">{{cite book |last=Chinebuah |first=Aidoohene Blay |year=2017 |title=Ghana's Pride and Glory:Biography of Some Eminent Ghanaian Personalities and Sir Gordon Guggisberg |url= |publisher=Graphic Communications|page=218}}</ref>\n \nAfter one and half years at Lincoln, he won a [[Phelps-Stokes Fund]] scholarship to attend [[Hampton Institute]] in Virginia, and transferred there to complete his university degree. He won another scholarship to the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] and obtained a master's degree in June 1943. He gained employment as a lecturer at the African Studies Department at [[Fisk University]] through the assistance of Dr. [[Edwin W. Smith]], a [[missionary]]. Dr. Smith had come from Englan to establish the new department and invited Ako Adjei to be his assistant at its founding.<ref name=\":chinebuah\"/>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nAko Adjei moved to the [[United Kingdom]] to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a lawyer. His teaching job at the [[Fisk University]] had provided him finances to enroll at the [[Inner Temple]] in early May 1944. Even though he had saved enough to begin the course he needed more money to complete it.

Nkrumah was then facing accommodation problems and he consequently hosted him at his No.25 Lauvier Road, until he found accommodation for him (Nkrumah) at No. 60 Burghley Road, near Tufnel Park Tube Station. Nkrumah was resident there until he left London in 1947. Ako Adjei then introduced Nkrumah to WASU and [[Kojo Botsio]] who later became his right hand man. Recalling his WASU days, Ako Adjei recounted, \"When Nkrumah arrived in London I was then President of the WASU. I took Nkrumah to the WASU Secretariat where I introduced him to Kankam Boadu and [[Joe Appiah]], who were other members of the executive committee of WASU, and to Kojo Botsio who we had then engaged as warden of the student's Hostel, at No.l South Villas, [[Camden Town]], London N. W. I. I must say that Nkrumah's arrival and active participation in the work of WASU\u00a0invigorated\u00a0the Union. It was against this background that we organised the Fifth Pan-African Congress which was held in [[Manchester]] in 1945 with [[George Padmore]] and Nkrumah as Joint Secretaries and myself as one of the active organisers.\"<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAko Adjei enrolled at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] for his M.Sc. degree programme while studying law at the Inner Temple. His topic for the dissertation, ''The Dynamics of Social Change'' was approved, however, the course, coupled with his political activities precluded his research due to time constraints.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAko Adjei passed all his [[English Bar|Bar]] examinations\u00a0and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in January 1947.<ref name=\"OA\"/><ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\n==Return to the Gold Coast==\nAko Adjei returned to the [[Gold Coast (British Colony)|Gold Coast]] in May 1947, his initial intention was to set up a \"chain of newspapers\" to continue the agitation for self-rule, a course he had committed himself to while in [[London]]. He was however, unable to start the newspapers due to his financial circumstances then, he subsequently joined the [[Kofi Adumua\u00a0Bossman|Adumoa-Bossman]]\u00a0and Co. chambers to practise as a private legal practitioner.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/><ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\n===United Gold Coast Convention===\nAfter staying in [[Accra]] for a couple of days, he visited [[Joseph Boakye Danquah|J. B. Danquah]] who was then with others discussing the possibility of forming a national political movement and Ako Adjei joined in the discussions.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> Ako Adjei like most Gold Coast students in Britain at the time  was fed up with the British newspaper reportage that created the impression that the Gold Coast was the most loyal colony.<ref name=\"OA\"/> Danquah assured him that a lot of work was being done to establish a national political front.<ref name=\"OA\"/> \n\nWithin four days of his arrival home he was taken by J . B. Danquah to a meeting of the Planning Committee of the [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC).<ref name=\"OA\"/> He then became a member of the committee and on 4 August 1947 when the convention was inaugurated at [[Saltpond]], he became one of the leading members. On 22 August 1947, the  Accra branch of the Convention was inaugurated and he was elected secretary with [[Edward Akufo-Addo]] as president and [[Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey]] together with J. Quist-Therson as the vice-presidents. As membership of the Convention grew, the leading members decided it was best to convert the movement to a political party. As a result, there was the need for a full time secretary, J. B. Danquah suggested Ako Adjei, however, he declined the offer for reasons of running his ''African National Times'' newspaper and practising law alongside. He subsequently suggested [[Kwame Nkrumah]] who was then running the [[West African National Secretariat]] (WANS)\u00a0at 94 Grays' Inn, [[London]].<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAccording to Ako Adjei he recommended Kwame Nkrumah because he had grown to know his organisational capabilities and that he knew he will be interested in the job. This was because, before he left London for Accra Nkrumah had told him; \"Ako you're going ahead of me. When you get to\u00a0the Gold Coast and there is a job which you think I can do, let me know right away so that I would come and work for sometime; save some money and then return to London to complete my studies in law at Gray 's Inn.\" This was a promise he had made thus when he heard of the\u00a0full\u00a0time General-Secretary job he did not hesitate to recommend him. The Convention accepted his suggestion and he wrote to Nkrumah about it and later sent him \u00a3100 which was provided by [[George Alfred Grant]], the\u00a0founder, president and financier of the UGCC for his trip to the Gold Coast. Upon the arrival of Nkrumah, Ako Adjei introduced him to the leading members of the party: \"He arrived in December 1947 and I introduced him to G. A. Grant, J. B. Danquah, [[Robert Samuel Blay|R. S Blay]] and other members of the\u00a0UGCC.\"<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nWhen Nkrumah assumed office as General-Secretary of the UGCC he begun initiating moves to expand the Convention colony-wide and increase its membership. This move coincided with the [[Nii Kwabena\u00a0Bonnie\u00a0III]] (Osu Alata Mantse) led boycott campaign which ended in the 28th February crossroad shooting incident resulting in the [[1948 Accra Riots]].<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> Ako Adjei and other leading members of the UGCC (including Nkrumah) who were later famously referred to as the [[The Big Six (Ghana)|The Big Six]] were consequently arrested and blamed by the then British  government for the unrest in the colony and Ako Adjei was detained at [[Navrongo]].<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> The release of the Big Six saw a separation between Nkrumah and the other members of the UGCC and Nkrumah eventually broke away in 1949 to found the [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP). Ako Adjei however stayed with the UGCC and subsequently became critical of Nkrumah in his newspapers; the ''African National Times'' and the ''Daily Echo''. One staunch opponent of Nkrumah and regular contributor to the ''Daily Echo'' was [[Tawia Adamafio]], who later joined the CPP.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nDuring the [[1951 Gold Coast legislative election]], Ako Adjei stood on the ticket of the UGCC to represent the Accra Central Municipal Electoral District in the Gold Coast Legislative Assembly. He pulled 1,451 votes as against Nkrumah's (CPP) 20,780, T. Hutton Mills' (CPP) 19,812, and Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey's (UGCC) 1,630 votes.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> Following the poor showing of the UGCC in the elections, he joined others to urge for a merger of the opposition parties. He became the Secretary of the [[Ghana Congress Party]] (GCP) when it was formed in May 1952. After sometime with the GCP, Ako Adjei refused to attend meetings as constant criticisms were levelled against him for introducing Nkrumah to disorganise the UGGC.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Botwe-Asamoah |first=Kwame |date=17 June 2013 |title=Kwame Nkrumah's Politico-Cultural Thought and Politics:An African-Centered Paradigm for the Second Phase of the African Revolution |url=https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=OcTC2eDx5ZsC&pg=PA98&dq=ako+adjei+born&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgiL_1uPnoAhWQUcAKHWLECSgQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&q=ako+adjei+born&f=false |publisher=Routledge |page=98}}</ref>\n\n===Convention People's Party===\nIn March 1953 Ako Adjei succumbed to pressure from friends such as E.

The meeting was to discuss further plans to eliminate customs barriers between Ghana and the Upper Volta. A move that was seen as a small step towards Pan-African unity. An unusually heavy downpour complicated the return trip from Tenkodogo on 1 August 1962, causing the usual order of the convoy to be in disarray over the poor road that connected the two countries.

On our return\u00a0journey, I was in the President's party which made an unscheduled stop at a small school at Kulungugu. Within minutes after the President alighted and received a bouquet from a young school boy, a hand grenade was thrown at him. The innocent boy received a direct hit and was killed instantly.

When I showed my cable to Nkrumah, he told me to go for him and send him to my house and entertain him on his behalf. I was to bring him the following day to the Flagstaff House for another reception before he left for [[Lagos]] in the afternoon.

His father was Samuel Adjei, a farmer and trader, whom Ako Adjei's place of birth is thought to be named after, and his mother was Johanna Okaile Adjei. Both parents were from La, a settlement near the coastal sea at [[Accra]].

He was taken to [[Accra]] where he continued his education at the Labadi Presbyterian Junior School starting in class 3. He was unable to speak the [[Ga language]] which was his mother tongue, however, he could read and write [[Twi]], and speak [[Dangme]]. He continued in the [[Labadi]] Presbyterian\u00a0Senior School until 1933 when he got to Standard Six. In March 1933 he won a scholarship to study at Christ Church Grammar School, a private secondary school which was on the point of winding up. He returned to the Labadi Presbyterian Senior School after a month at Christ Church Grammar School because he did not like the school.<ref name=\"OA\"/> \n\nHis father was then persuaded to send him to the [[Accra Academy]], then a private secondary school trying to find its feet through the help of enterprising young men. In April 1933 he entered the Accra Academy and he liked it there. He walked four miles from Labadi to [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] (where the school was then situated), because he could not afford the bus fare which was about [[Two\u00a0pence\u00a0(British decimal coin)|two pence]]. In 1934 he sat for the Junior Cambridge examination and passed it. While at the Accra Academy, he found difficulty in meeting the cost of books, however, a member of the staff, Mr.\u00a0Halm Addo (one of the four founders of the school), used to help him with money for\u00a0books. In December, 1936 he was one of the candidates presented by the Accra Academy for the Cambridge Senior School leaving Certificate Examination. Among the candidates who passed the examination, only two obtained exemption from the London Matriculation Examination Board. One of these students was Ako Adjei.<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\nHe taught for a while in 1937 before joining the Junior Civil Service in June 1937. From June 1937 to December 1938 he was a Second Division Clerk in the Gold Coast Civil Service. He was assigned to assist Harold Cooper, a European Assistant Colonial Secretary, and [[J. E. S. de Graft-Hayford]] to organise and establish the [[Gold Coast Broadcasting Service]]. These were the beginnings of what is now the [[Ghana Broadcasting Corporation]].<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\nWhile studying at the Accra Academy Ako Adjei had taken an interest in journalism, he wrote for [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]]'s ''African Morning Post''. Azikiwe also took an interest  in him and arranged for him to study at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[USA]]. In November 1938 he resigned from the Civil Service and left for [[England]] in December that year.<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\n===United States of America===\nIn January 1939, he arrived at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], [[Pennsylvania]] to the welcome of K.A.B. Jones-Quartey, a student from the Gold Coast whom Ako Adjei had know due to his work with the ''Accra Morning Post''. Jones-Quartey had been accompanied to welcome him by another Gold Coast student who was introduced as Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah ([[Kwame Nkrumah]]). At Lincoln University he was housed at Houston Hall. He registered for courses in Political Science, Economics, Sociology, English, Latin and Philosophy.<ref name=\":chinebuah\"/>\n \nAko Adjei shared the same room at Houston Hall with Jones-Quartey and their room was opposite Nkrumah's room, which was larger in size due to Nkrumah being a postgraduate student. Ako Adjei formed a close relationship with [[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]] despite the age gap that apparently existed between them. Together with a group of students, they often had long heated discussions (known as bull sessions) about the emancipation of African countries from colonial domination. Among the African students who regularly took part in these discussions were Jones-Quartey, [[K. O.\u00a0Mbadiwe|Ozuomba Mbadiwe]], [[Nwafor Orizu]] and [[Ikechukwu Ikejiani]].<ref name=\":chinebuah\">{{cite book |last=Chinebuah |first=Aidoohene Blay |year=2017 |title=Ghana's Pride and Glory:Biography of Some Eminent Ghanaian Personalities and Sir Gordon Guggisberg |url= |publisher=Graphic Communications|page=218}}</ref>\n \nAfter one and half years at Lincoln, he won a [[Phelps-Stokes Fund]] scholarship to attend [[Hampton Institute]] in Virginia, and transferred there to complete his university degree. He won another scholarship to the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] and obtained a master's degree in June 1943. He gained employment as a lecturer at the African Studies Department at [[Fisk University]] through the assistance of Dr. [[Edwin W. Smith]], a [[missionary]]. Dr. Smith had come from Englan to establish the new department and invited Ako Adjei to be his assistant at its founding.<ref name=\":chinebuah\"/>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nAko Adjei moved to the [[United Kingdom]] to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a lawyer. His teaching job at the [[Fisk University]] had provided him finances to enroll at the [[Inner Temple]] in early May 1944. Even though he had saved enough to begin the course he needed more money to complete it. His father leased a small family house located at the [[Ghana Post|Post Office]] Lane in [[Accra]] to a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] merchant for \u00a310 a year for fifty (50) years and took thirty (30) years' rent in advance. His father died before the negotiations were completed so he and his brothers had to sign the papers before the sum of \u00a3300 was paid by the Lebanese merchant.<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\nIn Britain, Ako Adjei took an active interest in colonial politics. Following the end of the [[Second World War]], a number of British colonies in Asia had gained independence, this made colonial students more concerned about the conditions at home and caused them to demand for the abolition of colonialism in [[West Africa]].<ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\nAko Adjei played a prominent role in the [[West African Students Union]] (WASU) and became its president.<ref name=\"Ako Adjei4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaculture.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=65&archiveid=959&page=1&adate=17/08/2007|title=Dr. Ako Adjei-Founder member of UGCC|publisher=ghanaculture.gov.gh|accessdate=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721030836/http://www.ghanaculture.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=65&archiveid=959&page=1&adate=17%2F08%2F2007|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Ako-Adjei 1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newsghana.com.gh/six-lessons-from-ghanas-big-six/|title=Six Lessons From Ghana's Big Six |publisher=newsghana.com.gh|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> Nkrumah arrived in Britain in 1945, a few weeks after his arrival in [[London]], Ako Adjei run into him during one of his rounds as the president of WASU. Nkrumah was then facing accommodation problems and he consequently hosted him at his No.25 Lauvier Road, until he found accommodation for him (Nkrumah) at No. 60 Burghley Road, near Tufnel Park Tube Station. Nkrumah was resident there until he left London in 1947. Ako Adjei then introduced Nkrumah to WASU and [[Kojo Botsio]] who later became his right hand man. Recalling his WASU days, Ako Adjei recounted, \"When Nkrumah arrived in London I was then President of the WASU. I took Nkrumah to the WASU Secretariat where I introduced him to Kankam Boadu and [[Joe Appiah]], who were other members of the executive committee of WASU, and to Kojo Botsio who we had then engaged as warden of the student's Hostel, at No.l South Villas, [[Camden Town]], London N. W. I. I must say that Nkrumah's arrival and active participation in the work of WASU\u00a0invigorated\u00a0the Union. It was against this background that we organised the Fifth Pan-African Congress which was held in [[Manchester]] in 1945 with [[George Padmore]] and Nkrumah as Joint Secretaries and myself as one of the active organisers.\"<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAko Adjei enrolled at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] for his M.Sc. degree programme while studying law at the Inner Temple. His topic for the dissertation, ''The Dynamics of Social Change'' was approved, however, the course, coupled with his political activities precluded his research due to time constraints.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAko Adjei passed all his [[English Bar|Bar]] examinations\u00a0and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in January 1947.<ref name=\"OA\"/><ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\n==Return to the Gold Coast==\nAko Adjei returned to the [[Gold Coast (British Colony)|Gold Coast]] in May 1947, his initial intention was to set up a \"chain of newspapers\" to continue the agitation for self-rule, a course he had committed himself to while in [[London]]. He was however, unable to start the newspapers due to his financial circumstances then, he subsequently joined the [[Kofi Adumua\u00a0Bossman|Adumoa-Bossman]]\u00a0and Co. chambers to practise as a private legal practitioner.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/><ref name=\"OA\"/>\n\n===United Gold Coast Convention===\nAfter staying in [[Accra]] for a couple of days, he visited [[Joseph Boakye Danquah|J. B. Danquah]] who was then with others discussing the possibility of forming a national political movement and Ako Adjei joined in the discussions.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> Ako Adjei like most Gold Coast students in Britain at the time  was fed up with the British newspaper reportage that created the impression that the Gold Coast was the most loyal colony.<ref name=\"OA\"/> Danquah assured him that a lot of work was being done to establish a national political front.<ref name=\"OA\"/> \n\nWithin four days of his arrival home he was taken by J . B. Danquah to a meeting of the Planning Committee of the [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC).<ref name=\"OA\"/> He then became a member of the committee and on 4 August 1947 when the convention was inaugurated at [[Saltpond]], he became one of the leading members. On 22 August 1947, the  Accra branch of the Convention was inaugurated and he was elected secretary with [[Edward Akufo-Addo]] as president and [[Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey]] together with J. Quist-Therson as the vice-presidents. As membership of the Convention grew, the leading members decided it was best to convert the movement to a political party. As a result, there was the need for a full time secretary, J. B. Danquah suggested Ako Adjei, however, he declined the offer for reasons of running his ''African National Times'' newspaper and practising law alongside. He subsequently suggested [[Kwame Nkrumah]] who was then running the [[West African National Secretariat]] (WANS)\u00a0at 94 Grays' Inn, [[London]].<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAccording to Ako Adjei he recommended Kwame Nkrumah because he had grown to know his organisational capabilities and that he knew he will be interested in the job. This was because, before he left London for Accra Nkrumah had told him; \"Ako you're going ahead of me. When you get to\u00a0the Gold Coast and there is a job which you think I can do, let me know right away so that I would come and work for sometime; save some money and then return to London to complete my studies in law at Gray 's Inn.\" This was a promise he had made thus when he heard of the\u00a0full\u00a0time General-Secretary job he did not hesitate to recommend him. The Convention accepted his suggestion and he wrote to Nkrumah about it and later sent him \u00a3100 which was provided by [[George Alfred Grant]], the\u00a0founder, president and financier of the UGCC for his trip to the Gold Coast. Upon the arrival of Nkrumah, Ako Adjei introduced him to the leading members of the party: \"He arrived in December 1947 and I introduced him to G. A. Grant, J. B. Danquah, [[Robert Samuel Blay|R. S Blay]] and other members of the\u00a0UGCC.\"<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nWhen Nkrumah assumed office as General-Secretary of the UGCC he begun initiating moves to expand the Convention colony-wide and increase its membership. This move coincided with the [[Nii Kwabena\u00a0Bonnie\u00a0III]] (Osu Alata Mantse) led boycott campaign which ended in the 28th February crossroad shooting incident resulting in the [[1948 Accra Riots]].<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> Ako Adjei and other leading members of the UGCC (including Nkrumah) who were later famously referred to as the [[The Big Six (Ghana)|The Big Six]] were consequently arrested and blamed by the then British  government for the unrest in the colony and Ako Adjei was detained at [[Navrongo]].<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> The release of the Big Six saw a separation between Nkrumah and the other members of the UGCC and Nkrumah eventually broke away in 1949 to found the [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP). Ako Adjei however stayed with the UGCC and subsequently became critical of Nkrumah in his newspapers; the ''African National Times'' and the ''Daily Echo''. One staunch opponent of Nkrumah and regular contributor to the ''Daily Echo'' was [[Tawia Adamafio]], who later joined the CPP.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nDuring the [[1951 Gold Coast legislative election]], Ako Adjei stood on the ticket of the UGCC to represent the Accra Central Municipal Electoral District in the Gold Coast Legislative Assembly. He pulled 1,451 votes as against Nkrumah's (CPP) 20,780, T. Hutton Mills' (CPP) 19,812, and Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey's (UGCC) 1,630 votes.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> Following the poor showing of the UGCC in the elections, he joined others to urge for a merger of the opposition parties. He became the Secretary of the [[Ghana Congress Party]] (GCP) when it was formed in May 1952. After sometime with the GCP, Ako Adjei refused to attend meetings as constant criticisms were levelled against him for introducing Nkrumah to disorganise the UGGC.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Botwe-Asamoah |first=Kwame |date=17 June 2013 |title=Kwame Nkrumah's Politico-Cultural Thought and Politics:An African-Centered Paradigm for the Second Phase of the African Revolution |url=https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=OcTC2eDx5ZsC&pg=PA98&dq=ako+adjei+born&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgiL_1uPnoAhWQUcAKHWLECSgQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&q=ako+adjei+born&f=false |publisher=Routledge |page=98}}</ref>\n\n===Convention People's Party===\nIn March 1953 Ako Adjei succumbed to pressure from friends such as E. C. Quaye, Sonny Provencal and [[Paul Tagoe]], and agreed to join the [[Convention People's Party]]. In early March 1953 he was introduced in a huge rally at Arena, [[Accra]] where he delivered his first speech on the platform as a member of the CPP.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nDuring the [[1954 Gold Coast legislative election]] he stood on the ticket of the CPP to represent Accra East in the Gold Coast Legislative Assembly. He pulled 11,660 votes against Nai Tete's 768, Kwamla Armah-Kwarteng's 471, and [[Nii Kwabena Bonnie III]]'s  317 votes.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nFollowing his record at the polls during the 1954 election, Ako Adjei was made a member of the Cabinet on 28 July 1954 by Nkrumah, who was then Prime Minister and Head of Government Business. He was appointed Minister of Trade and Labour.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ministry of Trade and Labour |date=1955 |title=Gold Coast, Handbook on Trade and Commerce |url=https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=54tpO-YYJ4AC&dq=ako+adjei+trade&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=ako+adjei |page=3}}</ref> One of the reasons for his appointment was the fact that he belonged to a class under-represented in the CPP, he being an intellectual and professional in the middle class, the move was regarded as a strategy to pull\u00a0people of his status to the CPP. As Minister of Trade and Labour, he was responsible for many aspects of the country's\u00a0life, he over oversaw the Agricultural Produce Marketing Board, the Cocoa Marketing Board, the Industrial Development Corporation, Trade Unions and Cooperatives.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/> In 1956 he was re-elected in the [[1956 Gold Coast legislative election]] to represent the Accra East district electoral area in the Gold Coast Legislative Assembly.\n\n==Post Ghanaian independence==\n===Minister for Interior and Justice===\nFollowing Ghana's indepence on 6 March 1957, major appointments were made at cabinet level by the then Prime Minister Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]].

The meeting was to discuss further plans to eliminate customs barriers between Ghana and the Upper Volta. A move that was seen as a small step towards Pan-African unity. An unusually heavy downpour complicated the return trip from Tenkodogo on 1 August 1962, causing the usual order of the convoy to be in disarray over the poor road that connected the two countries. A bomb was reportedly thrown at the president in [[Kulungugu]], a town in the Upper Region of [[Ghana]] when he was forced to stop to receive a bouquet from a young boy.<ref name=ellison/>\n\nAko Adjei, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, together with [[Tawia Adamafio]], the Minister of Information, Hugh Horatio Cofie Crabbe, the CPP Executive Secretary, [[Joseph Yaw Manu]], a civil servant and alleged member of the UP and Robert Benjamin Otchere, former UP member of parliament, were accused of plotting to assassinate the president.<ref name=ellison/> \n\nAko Adjei, Tawiah Adamafio and Cofie Crabbe were trialled and acquitted by the Supreme Court on the basis that the evidence presented against them was rather circumstantial and fraudulent; and centered more on the dissensions in the CPP as the basis of their accusation.<ref name=ellison/>\nA member of the Ghana Parliament described their guilt as such:\n{{quote|\"On the journey... to the place of the incident, they (Adamafio, Crabbe, and Ako Adjei), isolated themselves from the Leader, to whom they had clung previously all along as if they were his lovers. They rode in different cars and were hundreds of yards away leaving the President behind.\"|F.E.

[[Kobina\u00a0Arku\u00a0Korsah]], Justice [[Edward Akufo-Addo]] and Justice [[Kofi Adumua Bossman]] were subsequently forced to resign. Nkrumah then empaneled new judges headed by Justice [[Julius Sarkodee-Addo]], who found the acquitted, guilty based largely on the evidence of the fetish priest. Ako Adjei and the two others were consequently sentenced to death, however, the sentence was commuted by president to life imprisonment.<ref name=ellison/><ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAko Adjei reflecting on the event of 1 August 1962 had this to say:<blockquote>\"I was innocent and I know that my two friends, Tawia Adamafio and Cofie Crabbe were also innocent. What happened was that I accompanied Nkrumah in my capacity as Foreign Minister to a miniature summit between President Nkrumah and President Yameogo at Tenkudugu at the northern boundary between Togo, Ghana and Upper Volta\u00a0on July 31, 1962. On our return\u00a0journey, I was in the President's party which made an unscheduled stop at a small school at Kulungugu. Within minutes after the President alighted and received a bouquet from a young school boy, a hand grenade was thrown at him. The innocent boy received a direct hit and was killed instantly. Fortunately, the hand grenade missed the President although some pellets found their way to his back. We got the Osagyefo to [[Bawku]] where he was later sent to [[Tamale]]. Back in Accra everything moved on\u00a0smoothly. And in the latter part of July 1962 I received a note from Dr.\u00a0Okechuku\u00a0Ekejeani, a former colleague at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] and a mutual friend of Nkrumah and myself. He was travelling from [[London]] and sent a cablegram on board his ship to the President and myself. When I showed my cable to Nkrumah, he told me to go for him and send him to my house and entertain him on his behalf. I was to bring him the following day to the Flagstaff House for another reception before he left for [[Lagos]] in the afternoon. We were entertaining him on that Wednesday, August 29, 1962 when I was arrested and taken away. For the next four\u00a0years only God knew what happened to me.\"</blockquote><ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAko Adjei together with his three colleagues were among many political prisoners that were released by the [[National Liberation Council]] after the overthrow of president Nkrumah and the [[Nkrumah government|First Republican Government]] on 24 February 1966.

After his release, he devoted himself to his family and his legal life.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nHe gave much attention to his wife and children. According to him, his wife and children were very supportive during the period when he was trialled, retrialled and subsequently imprisoned.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nHe also reorganised his professional life, succeeded in reorganising his chambers; Teianshi Chambers and resumed private practice as a legal practitioner.<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nFollowing the second military coup in Ghana, Ako-Adjei was made a member of the Commission by the [[Supreme Military Council (Ghana)|Supreme Military Council]] in 1978 to draft a constitution for the Third Republic of Ghana.\n\n==Personal life, death and burial==\nAko Adjei was married to Theodosia Ako Adjei (''n\u00e9e'' Kote-Amon) and together they had four daughters. He was Christian and a member of the [[Presbyterian Church of Ghana]]. As a Christian, he believed and emphasised as his philosophy of life that God controlled all\u00a0affairs and had a purpose for everybody on earth. \"What every individual must do therefore is to allow God to use him as a tool to serve Him.\"<ref name=\":Vieta\"/>\n\nAko Adjei was the last member of the famous [[The Big Six (Ghana)|Big Six]] to die.

He submitted his first work to a magazine in his first year of high school.<ref name=\"lecture\"/> All his submissions were rejected while other artists his age or younger were making successful debuts. He decided to go to the publishers' offices in Tokyo to find out why in person, taking a manga he stayed up all-night to finish.<ref name=\"lecture\"/> The [[Shueisha]] editor he met highly criticized the work, but said it had potential and to clean it up for the upcoming [[Tezuka Award]]s.<ref name=\"lecture\"/> The manga was ''Poker Under Arms''.\n\n===Debut and ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure''===\nAraki left [[Miyagi University of Education]] before graduating, and made his debut in 1980 with the [[wild west]] one-shot ''Poker Under Arms'', which was a \"Selected Work\" at that year's Tezuka Award.<ref name=\"lecture\"/><ref name=\"1000manga\">{{cite web |title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Jojo's Bizarre Adventure |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2010-12-23 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref> His first serialization was ''Cool Shock B.T.'' in 1983, about a young magician who solves mysteries.<ref name=\"1000manga\"/> But the first series to display his signature amount of [[Graphic violence|gore]] was 1984's ''[[Baoh]]''.<ref name=\"1000manga\"/> It tells the story of a man who is implanted with a parasite by an evil organization, giving him superhuman powers, and follows as he fights against them. It was adapted into an [[Original video animation|OVA]] in 1989, the manga was released in the US by [[Viz Media]] in 1990 (in ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' form in 1995), but the OVA didn't get a stateside release until 2002. It wasn't until ''The Gorgeous Irene'' in 1985, that he really developed his signature art style of buff, muscular characters (it would later become more flamboyant).<ref name=\"1000manga\"/>\n\nHis next series would become his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], 1987's ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]''. The series begins in 1880s [[England]] and follows [[Jonathan Joestar]] (JoJo) and his adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who eventually tries to kill their father in order to obtain his share of inheritance.<ref name=\"1000manga\"/> When confronted, Dio puts on an ancient mask that turns him into a [[vampire]]. JoJo then learns a breathing technique called ''hamon'', and travels to Dio's castle to kill him. Subsequent arcs of ''JoJo'' follow the descendants of the Joestar family, and many are set in different parts of the world. [[Stardust Crusaders|Part 3]], which would become the most popular part in the series, downplays the vampire story and hamon technique and instead introduces the power of [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure#Stand powers|Stands]], which continues in the series today.<ref name=\"1000manga\"/><ref name=\"MikeToole\">{{cite web |title=The Mike Toole Show - Jojo's Mojo |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2014-06-01/.75101 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref> Still being serialized over 30 years later, ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' has been adapted into numerous other forms of media and the manga had 100 million collected volumes in print by December 2016.

It was released on May 11, 2012, through the band's own [[record label]], Stunvolume. The album marks the return of the band after a seven-year hiatus that started with previous album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]''. Guitarist [[Duke Erikson]] said at the launch of the record that \"working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like getting on a bicycle...with three other people.\"<ref name=Guitarworld/> The band emphasized that they did not want to reinvent themselves, but embrace their sonic identity, reflecting their classic sound whilst updating it for 2012. Although [[Shirley Manson]]'s morose dispositions have a presence on the record, many of the songs share a more optimistic outlook on life, influenced by some of Manson's personal experiences during their hiatus.\n\nRecorded mostly at various recording studios in California, ''Not Your Kind of People'' was produced by Garbage, and was [[audio engineering|engineered]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by [[Billy Bush (producer)|Billy Bush]]. The album contains [[bass guitar]] parts recorded by [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] while [[Finns|Finnish]] actress [[Irina Bj\u00f6rklund]] performs the [[musical saw]] on one track. Both daughters of band-members [[Steve Marker]] and [[Butch Vig]] laid down vocals on the album's [[wikt:en:title track|title track]]. Photos for the album package were shot by [[Autumn de Wilde]] at the [[Canfield-Moreno Estate|Paramour Mansion]] in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles]].\n\n''Not Your Kind of People'' was preceded by the release of \"[[Blood for Poppies]]\" as the lead single internationally, while in the United Kingdom, \"[[Battle in Me]]\" was marketed as the album's lead single. The album also spawned three more singles, \"[[Automatic Systematic Habit]]\", \"[[Big Bright World]]\", and \"[[Control (Garbage song)|Control]]\". ''Not Your Kind of People'' received a generally positive reception from critics. It debuted at number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], at number 10 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], peaked at number three on ''Billboard'''s [[Independent Albums]] chart and topped the Alternative Albums chart.\n\n==Background==\nGarbage decided to take a hiatus in 2005, following the troubled production of their fourth studio album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]'' and cutting short [[Bleed Like Me tour|the album's promotional tour]].<ref name=\"NMEcancel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/20861| title=Garbage pull tour|work=NME|date=August 29, 2005|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510121/20050922/garbage.jhtml |title=Shirley Manson On Garbage Hiatus: 'I'm Burnt, I'm Done, I'm Toast' says singer|publisher=[[MTV News]]|author=Moss, Corey|accessdate=February 24, 2008}}</ref> Aside from a reunion in 2007 to compose new tracks for the compilation ''[[Absolute Garbage]]'', the band members found themselves involved in various projects, with [[Butch Vig]] producing [[Green Day]], [[Foo Fighters]], and [[Muse (band)|Muse]],<ref name=MusicRadar/> while singer [[Shirley Manson]]  recorded an unreleased solo album and made her professional acting debut as a series regular on ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2012/03/21/shirley-manson-on-garbages-comback-nobodys-making-music-like-us/|title=Shirley Manson On Garbage's Comeback: \"Nobody's Making Music Like Us\"|work=KROQ-FM|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Shirleymansonsept2008.jpg\n| width1 = 161\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = ButchVig2010.jpg\n| width2 = 170\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = When Shirley Manson and Butch Vig met during Garbage's hiatus in 2009, they decided that the band had to get back together and write again.\n}}\nIn 2009, Vig and Manson met at the funeral of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of [[Dangerbird Records]] founder [[Jeff Castelaz]], and had a conversation where, according to Vig, \"we felt like we had some unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives.\" Manson suggested calling guitarists [[Duke Erikson]] and [[Steve Marker]] to get together and write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in [[Los Angeles]], where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and \"started fucking around.\"<ref name=comeback/><ref name=rave/> \"We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions,\" Vig recalled. \"Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated.

So we made this on our own terms.\"<ref name=clear/> In that session, the group wrote the song \"[[Battle In Me]]\".<ref name=rave>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/wisconsin-band-garbage-coming-home-to-the-rave-201436841.html|title=Wisconsin band Garbage coming home to the Rave|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|first=Piet|last=Levy|date=April 4, 2013|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2010, the entire group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson suggested they book a studio and spend time writing.

[[Rock music|rock]] band [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. It was released on May 11, 2012, through the band's own [[record label]], Stunvolume. The album marks the return of the band after a seven-year hiatus that started with previous album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]''. Guitarist [[Duke Erikson]] said at the launch of the record that \"working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like getting on a bicycle...with three other people.\"<ref name=Guitarworld/> The band emphasized that they did not want to reinvent themselves, but embrace their sonic identity, reflecting their classic sound whilst updating it for 2012. Although [[Shirley Manson]]'s morose dispositions have a presence on the record, many of the songs share a more optimistic outlook on life, influenced by some of Manson's personal experiences during their hiatus.\n\nRecorded mostly at various recording studios in California, ''Not Your Kind of People'' was produced by Garbage, and was [[audio engineering|engineered]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by [[Billy Bush (producer)|Billy Bush]]. The album contains [[bass guitar]] parts recorded by [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] while [[Finns|Finnish]] actress [[Irina Bj\u00f6rklund]] performs the [[musical saw]] on one track. Both daughters of band-members [[Steve Marker]] and [[Butch Vig]] laid down vocals on the album's [[wikt:en:title track|title track]]. Photos for the album package were shot by [[Autumn de Wilde]] at the [[Canfield-Moreno Estate|Paramour Mansion]] in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles]].\n\n''Not Your Kind of People'' was preceded by the release of \"[[Blood for Poppies]]\" as the lead single internationally, while in the United Kingdom, \"[[Battle in Me]]\" was marketed as the album's lead single. The album also spawned three more singles, \"[[Automatic Systematic Habit]]\", \"[[Big Bright World]]\", and \"[[Control (Garbage song)|Control]]\". ''Not Your Kind of People'' received a generally positive reception from critics. It debuted at number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], at number 10 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], peaked at number three on ''Billboard'''s [[Independent Albums]] chart and topped the Alternative Albums chart.\n\n==Background==\nGarbage decided to take a hiatus in 2005, following the troubled production of their fourth studio album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]'' and cutting short [[Bleed Like Me tour|the album's promotional tour]].<ref name=\"NMEcancel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/20861| title=Garbage pull tour|work=NME|date=August 29, 2005|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510121/20050922/garbage.jhtml |title=Shirley Manson On Garbage Hiatus: 'I'm Burnt, I'm Done, I'm Toast' says singer|publisher=[[MTV News]]|author=Moss, Corey|accessdate=February 24, 2008}}</ref> Aside from a reunion in 2007 to compose new tracks for the compilation ''[[Absolute Garbage]]'', the band members found themselves involved in various projects, with [[Butch Vig]] producing [[Green Day]], [[Foo Fighters]], and [[Muse (band)|Muse]],<ref name=MusicRadar/> while singer [[Shirley Manson]]  recorded an unreleased solo album and made her professional acting debut as a series regular on ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2012/03/21/shirley-manson-on-garbages-comback-nobodys-making-music-like-us/|title=Shirley Manson On Garbage's Comeback: \"Nobody's Making Music Like Us\"|work=KROQ-FM|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Shirleymansonsept2008.jpg\n| width1 = 161\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = ButchVig2010.jpg\n| width2 = 170\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = When Shirley Manson and Butch Vig met during Garbage's hiatus in 2009, they decided that the band had to get back together and write again.\n}}\nIn 2009, Vig and Manson met at the funeral of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of [[Dangerbird Records]] founder [[Jeff Castelaz]], and had a conversation where, according to Vig, \"we felt like we had some unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives.\" Manson suggested calling guitarists [[Duke Erikson]] and [[Steve Marker]] to get together and write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in [[Los Angeles]], where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and \"started fucking around.\"<ref name=comeback/><ref name=rave/> \"We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions,\" Vig recalled. \"Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling us what to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms.\"<ref name=clear/> In that session, the group wrote the song \"[[Battle In Me]]\".<ref name=rave>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/wisconsin-band-garbage-coming-home-to-the-rave-201436841.html|title=Wisconsin band Garbage coming home to the Rave|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|first=Piet|last=Levy|date=April 4, 2013|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2010, the entire group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson suggested they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband [[Billy Bush (producer)|Billy Bush]], the band, as Bush described, \"hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music\u201d.<ref name=psw>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/engineer_billy_bush_deploys_shure_ksm313_ksm353_in_recording_new_garbage_al/|title=Engineer Billy Bush Deploys Shure KSM313 & KSM353 In Recording New Garbage Album|date=April 6, 2012|publisher=Pro Sound Web|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref> Three or four song ideas came together during this time. \"But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode\", Erikson recalled. \"It took a bit of time for us to realize that we were going to make an album.\"<ref name=MusicRadar>{{cite web|title=Garbage on their Upcoming Album|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/interview-garbage-on-their-upcoming-new-album-513609|website=[[MusicRadar]]|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref> Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album.<ref name=erikson/> The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record.<ref name=comeback>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/garbage-make-their-big-comeback-20120604#ixzz2W8mCgROd|title=Garbage Make Their Big Comeback|work=Rolling Stone|last=Norris|first=Chris|date=June 4, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness \"to make loud music again\". \"I'm a loud person\", she proclaimed; \"I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a [[Hercules|Herculean]] effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying.

So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs over the course of a couple of months.<ref name=\"Fuse\"/> Marker commented that \"the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff.
