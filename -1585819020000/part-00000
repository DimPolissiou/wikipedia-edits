The mechanized [[assembly line]] was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion, with individual workers performing specific steps during the process. This led to significant increases in efficiency, lowering the cost of the end process. Later [[automation]] was increasingly used to replace human operators. This process has accelerated with the development of the [[computer]] and the [[robot]].\n\n== Deindustrialisation ==\n{{main|Deindustrialisation}}\n[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|thumb|upright=2.05|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]\n\nHistorically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors, including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage. An example of the former is the decline in [[carriage]] manufacturing when the [[automobile]] was mass-produced.\n\nA recent trend has been the migration of prosperous, industrialized nations towards a [[post-industrial society]]. This is manifested by an increase in the [[service sector]] at the expense of manufacturing, and the development of an information-based economy, the so-called [[informational revolution]]. In a post-industrial society, manufacturers relocate to more profitable locations through a process of [[off-shoring]].\n\nMeasurements of manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect are not historically stable. Traditionally, success has been measured in the number of jobs created. The reduced number of employees in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to result from a decline in the competitiveness of the sector, or the introduction of the [[lean manufacturing]] process.\n\nRelated to this change is the upgrading of the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of the product being manufactured. While it is possible to produce a low-technology product with low-skill labour, the ability to manufacture high-technology products well is dependent on a highly skilled staff.\n\n== Society ==\n{{main|Industrial society}}\nAn [[industrial society]] is a society driven by the use of [[technology]] to enable [[mass production]], supporting a [[Population growth|large population]] with a high capacity for [[division of labour]]. Today, industry is an important part of most societies and nations. A government must have some kind of [[industrial policy]], regulating industrial placement, [[pollution|industrial pollution]], [[financing]] and [[industrial labour]].\n\n== Industrial labour ==\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel components (KINEX BEARINGS, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n{{main|Industrial labour}}\n{{further|industrial sociology|industrial and organizational psychology|industrial district|industrial park}}\nIn an industrial society, industry employs a major part of the population. This occurs typically in the manufacturing sector. A labour union is an organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas such as wages, hours, and other working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This [[labour movement|movement]] first rose among industrial workers.\n\n== War ==\n{{main|Industrial warfare}}\n[[File:Airacobra P39 Assembly LOC 02902u.jpg|thumb|The assembly plant of the [[Bell Aircraft Corporation]] ([[Wheatfield, New York]], United States, 1944) producing [[P-39 Airacobra]] fighters]]\nThe Industrial Revolution changed warfare, with [[mass-produced]] weaponry and supplies, machine-powered transportation, [[mobilization]], the [[total war]] concept and [[weapons of mass destruction]].

The mechanized [[assembly line]] was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion, with individual workers performing specific steps during the process. This led to significant increases in efficiency, lowering the cost of the end process. Later [[automation]] was increasingly used to replace human operators. This process has accelerated with the development of the [[computer]] and the [[robot]].\n\n== Deindustrialisation ==\n{{main|Deindustrialisation}}\n[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|thumb|upright=2.05|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]\n\nHistorically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors, including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage. An example of the former is the decline in [[carriage]] manufacturing when the [[automobile]] was mass-produced.\n\nA recent trend has been the migration of prosperous, industrialized nations towards a [[post-industrial society]]. This is manifested by an increase in the [[service sector]] at the expense of manufacturing, and the development of an information-based economy, the so-called [[informational revolution]]. In a post-industrial society, manufacturers relocate to more profitable locations through a process of [[off-shoring]].\n\nMeasurements of manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect are not historically stable. Traditionally, success has been measured in the number of jobs created. The reduced number of employees in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to result from a decline in the competitiveness of the sector, or the introduction of the [[lean manufacturing]] process.\n\nRelated to this change is the upgrading of the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of the product being manufactured. While it is possible to produce a low-technology product with low-skill labour, the ability to manufacture high-technology products well is dependent on a highly skilled staff.\n\n== Society ==\n{{main|Industrial society}}\nAn [[industrial society]] is a society driven by the use of [[technology]] to enable [[mass production]], supporting a [[Population growth|large population]] with a high capacity for [[division of labour]]. Today, industry is an important part of most societies and nations. A government must have some kind of [[industrial policy]], regulating industrial placement, [[pollution|industrial pollution]], [[financing]] and [[industrial labour]].\n\n== Industrial labour ==\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel components (KINEX BEARINGS, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n{{main|Industrial labour}}\n{{further|industrial sociology|industrial and organizational psychology|industrial district|industrial park}}\nIn an industrial society, industry employs a major part of the population. This occurs typically in the manufacturing sector. A labour union is an organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas such as wages, hours, and other working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This [[labour movement|movement]] first rose among industrial workers.\n\n== War ==\n{{main|Industrial warfare}}\n[[File:Airacobra P39 Assembly LOC 02902u.jpg|thumb|The assembly plant of the [[Bell Aircraft Corporation]] ([[Wheatfield, New York]], United States, 1944) producing [[P-39 Airacobra]] fighters]]\nThe Industrial Revolution changed warfare, with [[mass-produced]] weaponry and supplies, machine-powered transportation, [[mobilization]], the [[total war]] concept and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Early instances of [[industrial warfare]] were the [[Crimean War]] and the [[American Civil War]], but its full potential showed during the [[world wars]].

It is one of the westernmost cities of China, near the border with [[Afghanistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[India]]. With a population of over 500,000, Kashgar has served as a trading post and strategically important city on the [[Silk Road]] between China, the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]] for over 2,000 years.\n\nAt the convergence point of widely varying cultures and empires, Kashgar has been under the rule of the Chinese, Turkic, Mongol and Tibetan empires. The city has also been the site of a number of battles between various groups of people on the steppes.\n\nNow administered as a county-level unit, Kashgar is the administrative centre of [[Kashgar Prefecture]], which has an area of {{convert|162000|km\u00b2}} and a population of approximately 4 million as of 2010.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkAVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA65|pages=65\u201366 |title=Eurasian Corridors of Interconnection: From the South China to the Caspian Sea|editors= Susan M.

The city was made into a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in 2010, the only city in western China with this distinction.

By the time covered by the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (roughly 25 to 170 CE), it had grown to 21,000 households and had 3,000 men able to bear arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' provides a wealth of detail on developments in the region:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{bquote|In the period of Emperor Wu [140-87 BC], the Western Regions1 were under the control of the Interior [China]. They numbered thirty-six kingdoms. The Imperial Government established a Colonel [in charge of] Envoys there to direct and protect these countries. Emperor Xuan [73-49 BC] changed this title [in 59 BC] to Protector-General.\n\nEmperor Yuan [40-33 BC] installed two Wuji Colonels to take charge of the agricultural garrisons on the frontiers of the king of Nearer Jushi [Turpan].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the time of Emperor Ai [6 BCE - 1 CE] and Emperor Ping [1 - 5 CE], the principalities of the Western Regions split up and formed fifty-five kingdoms. Wang Mang, after he usurped the Throne [in 9 CE], demoted and changed their kings and marquises. Following this, the Western Regions became resentful, and rebelled. They, therefore, broke off all relations with the Interior [China] and, all together, submitted to the Xiongnu again.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Xiongnu collected oppressively heavy taxes and the kingdoms were not able to support their demands. In the middle of the Jianwu period [AD 25-56], they each [Shanshan and Yarkand in 38, and 18 kingdoms in 45], sent envoys to ask if they could submit to the Interior [China], and to express their desire for a Protector-General. Emperor Guangwu, decided that because the Empire was not yet settled [after a long period of civil war], he had no time for outside affairs, and [therefore] finally refused his consent [in 45 CE].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the meantime, the Xiongnu became weaker. The king of Suoju [Yarkand], named Xian, wiped out several kingdoms. After Xian\u2019s death [c. 62 CE], they began to attack and fight each other. Xiao Yuan [Tura], Jingjue [Cadota], Ronglu [Niya], and Qiemo [Cherchen] were annexed by Shanshan [the Lop Nur region]. Qule [south of Keriya] and Pishan [modern Pishan or Guma] were conquered and fully occupied by Yutian [Khotan]. Yuli [Fukang], Danhuan, Guhu [Dawan Cheng], and Wutanzili were destroyed by Jushi [Turpan and Jimasa].

The king of the Yuezhi became very fond of him. Later, Anguo died without leaving a son. His mother directed the government of the kingdom. She agreed with the people of the country to put Yifu (lit. \u201cposthumous child\u201d), who was the son of a full younger brother of Chenpan on the throne as king of Shule (Kashgar). Chenpan heard of this and appealed to the [[Yuezhi]] ([[Kushan]]) king, saying:\n\n: \"Anguo had no son. His relative (Yifu) is weak. If one wants to put on the throne a member of (Anguo\u2019s) mother\u2019s family, I am Yifu\u2019s paternal uncle, it is I who should be king.\"\n\nThe Yuezhi (Kushans) then sent soldiers to escort him back to Shule (Kashgar). The people had previously respected and been fond of Chenpan. Besides, they dreaded the Yuezhi (Kushans). They immediately took the seal and ribbon from Yifu and went to Chenpan, and made him king. Yifu was given the title of Marquis of the town of Pangao [90 li, or 37 km, from Shule].\n\nThen Suoju (Yarkand) continued to resist Yutian (Khotan), and put themselves under Shule (Kashgar). Thus Shule (Kashgar), became powerful and a rival to Qiuci (Kucha) and Yutian (Khotan).\"<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}\n}}\n\nHowever, it was not very long before the Chinese began to reassert their authority in the region:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yongjian year (127), during Emperor Shun\u2019s reign, Chenpan sent an envoy to respectfully present offerings. The Emperor bestowed on Chenpan the title of Great Commandant-in-Chief for the Han. Chenxun, who was the son of his elder brother, was appointed Temporary Major of the Kingdom.\n\nIn the fifth year (130), Chenpan sent his son to serve the Emperor and, along with envoys from Dayuan (Ferghana) and Suoju (Yarkand), brought tribute and offerings.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}}}\n\nFrom an earlier part of the same text comes the following addition:\n\n{{bquote|In the first Yangjia year (132), Xu You sent the king of Shule (Kashgar), Chenpan, who with 20,000 men, attacked and defeated Yutian (Khotan).

He replaced the king [of Jumi] by installing Chengguo from the family of [the previous king] Xing, and then he returned.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|15}}}}\n\nThen the first passage continues:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yangjia year (133), Chenpan again made offerings (including) a lion and zebu cattle.\n\nThen, during Emperor Ling\u2019s reign, in the first Jianning year [168], the king of Shule (Kashgar) and Commandant-in-Chief for the Han (i.e. presumably Chenpan), was killed while hunting by the youngest of his paternal uncles, Hede. Hede named himself king.\n\nIn the third year (170), Meng Tuo, the Inspector of Liangzhou, sent the Provincial Officer Ren She, commanding five hundred soldiers from Dunhuang, with the Wuji Major Cao Kuan, and Chief Clerk of the Western Regions, Zhang Yan, brought troops from Yanqi ([[Karashahr]]), Qiuci (Kucha), and the Nearer and Further States of Jushi (Turpan and Jimasa), altogether numbering more than 30,000, to punish Shule (Kashgar). They attacked the town of Zhenzhong [Arach \u2212 near Maralbashi] but, having stayed for more than forty days without being able to subdue it, they withdrew. Following this, the kings of Shule (Kashgar) killed one another repeatedly while the Imperial Government was unable to prevent it.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43, 45}}}}\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to the Sui dynasty ===\nThese centuries are marked by a general silence in sources on Kashgar and the Tarim Basin.\n\nThe ''[[Weil\u00fce]]'', composed in the second third of the 3rd century, mentions a number of states as dependencies of Kashgar: the kingdom of Zhenzhong (Arach?), the kingdom of Suoju (Yarkand), the kingdom of Jieshi, the kingdom of Qusha, the kingdom of Xiye (Khargalik), the kingdom of Yinai (Tashkurghan), the kingdom of Manli (modern Karasul), the kingdom of Yire (Mazar \u2212 also known as T\u00e1gh N\u00e1k and Tokanak), the kingdom of Yuling, the kingdom of Juandu (\u2018Tax Control\u2019 \u2212 near modern Irkeshtam), the kingdom of Xiuxiu (\u2018Excellent Rest Stop\u2019 \u2212 near Karakavak), and the kingdom of Qin.\n\nHowever, much of the information on the Western Regions contained in the ''Weil\u00fce'' seems to have ended roughly about (170), near the end of Han power. So, we cannot be sure that this is a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms.\n\nChapter 30 of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' says that after the beginning of the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] (220) the states of the Western Regions did not arrive as before, except for the larger ones such as [[Kucha]], [[Khotan]], [[Kangju]], [[Wusun]], Kashgar, [[Yuezhi]], [[Shanshan]] and [[Turpan]], who are said to have come to present tribute every year, as in Han times.\n\n[[File:Silk Road 1992.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Camels traversing the old [[silk road]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 270, four states from the Western Regions were said to have presented tribute: [[Karashahr]], [[Turpan]], [[Shanshan]], and [[Kucha]]. Some wooden documents from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] seem to indicate that contacts were also maintained with Kashgar and Khotan around this time.\n\nIn 422, according to the ''Songshu'', ch. 98, the king of Shanshan, Bilong, came to the court and \"the thirty-six states in the Western Regions\" all swore their allegiance and presented tribute. It must be assumed that these 36 states included Kashgar.\n\nThe \"Songji\" of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]] records that in the 5th month of 435, nine states: Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all came to the Wei court.\n\nIn 439, according to the ''Weishu'', ch. 4A, Shanshan, Kashgar and Karashahr sent envoys to present tribute.\n\nAccording to the ''Weishu'', ch. 102, Chapter on the Western Regions, the kingdoms of Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all began sending envoys to present tribute in the Taiyuan reign period (435-440).\n\nIn 453 Kashgar sent envoys to present tribute (''Weishu'', ch. 5), and again in 455.\n\nAn embassy sent during the reign of Wencheng Di (452-466) from the king of Kashgar presented a supposed sacred relic of the Buddha; a dress which was incombustible.\n\nIn 507 Kashgar, is said to have sent envoys in both the 9th and 10th months (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nIn 512, Kashgar sent envoys in the 1st and 5th months. (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nEarly in the 6th century Kashgar is included among the many territories controlled by the Yeda or [[Hephthalite]] Huns, but their empire collapsed at the onslaught of the Western Turks between 563 and 567 who then probably gained control over Kashgar and most of the states in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n===Tang dynasty===\n{{Main|Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|Tang campaign against the oasis states|l2=oasis states|Conquest of the Western Turks}}\n\nThe founding of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 saw the beginning of a prolonged struggle between China and the Western Turks for control of the Tarim Basin. In 635, the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tang Annals]]'' reported an emissary from the king of Kashgar to the Tang capital. In 639 there was a second emissary bringing products of Kashgar as a token of submission to the Tang state.\n\nBuddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]] passed through Kashgar (which he referred to as ''Ka-sha'') in 644 on his return journey from [[India]] to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to decay in India, was active in Kashgar. Xuanzang recorded that they flattened their babies heads, tattooed their bodies and had green eyes. He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen stuffs and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was different from that of other countries. The inhabitants were sincere Buddhist adherents and there were some hundreds of monasteries with more than 10,000 followers, all members of the [[Sarvastivadin]] School.\n\nAt around the same era, [[Nestorian Christians]] were establishing bishoprics at [[Herat]], [[Merv]] and [[Samarkand]], whence they subsequently proceeded to Kashgar, and finally to [[China proper]] itself.\n\nIn 646, the Turkic Kagan asked for the hand of a Tang Chinese princess, and in return the Emperor promised Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, Karashahr and Sarikol as a marriage gift, but this did not happen as planned.\n\nIn a series of campaigns between 652 and 658, with the help of the Uyghurs, the Chinese finally [[Conquest of the Western Turks|defeated the Western Turk tribes]] and took control of all their domains, including the Tarim Basin kingdoms. [[Karakhoja]] was [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexed in 640]], [[Karashahr]] during campaigns [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|in 644]] and 648, and [[Tang campaign against Kucha|Kucha fell]] in 648.\n\nIn 662 a rebellion broke out in the Western Regions and a Chinese army sent to control it was defeated by the [[Tibet]]ans south of Kashgar.\n\nAfter another defeat of the Tang Chinese forces in 670, the Tibetans gained control of the whole region and completely subjugated Kashgar in 676-8 and retained possession of it until 692, when the Tang dynasty regained control of all their former territories, and retained it for the next fifty years.\n\nIn 722 Kashgar sent 4,000 troops to assist the Chinese to force the \"Tibetans out of \"Little Bolu\" or [[Gilgit, Pakistan|Gilgit]].\n\nIn 728, the king of Kashgar was awarded a brevet by the Chinese emperor.\n\nIn 739, the ''Tangshu'' relates that the governor of the Chinese garrison in Kashgar, with the help of Ferghana, was interfering in the affairs of the [[Turgesh]] tribes as far as [[Taraz|Talas]].\n\n[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d08.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Mosque entrance in old Kashgar]]\n\nIn 751 the Chinese were defeated by an Arab army in the [[Battle of Talas]]. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] led to the decline of Tang influence in Central Asia due to the fact that the Tang dynasty was forced to withdraw its troops from the region to fight An Lushan. The Tibetans cut all communication between China and the West in 766.\n\nSoon after the Chinese pilgrim monk Wukong passed through Kashgar in 753. He again reached Kashgar on his return trip from India in 786 and mentions a Chinese deputy governor as well as the local king.\n\n===Battles with Arab Caliphate===\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nIn 711, the Arabs invaded Kashgar.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PT798&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places  |editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger |page=598 |publisher=Routledge|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-884964-04-6 }}</ref> It is alleged that [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] in 712-715 had conquered Xinjiang.<ref name=\"Dillon2014\">{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=Xinjiang and the Expansion of Chinese Communist Power: Kashgar in the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2MtBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-64721-8|pages=7\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Broomhall1910\">{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan & Scott, Limited|pages=17\u2013}}</ref> Although the Muslim religion from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless made its weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and east, and thus acquired a steadily growing influence.

The dynasty of the Chagatai Khans collapsed in 1572 with the division of the country among rival factions; soon after, two powerful [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] factions, the White and Black Mountaineers ([[Ak Tagh]]liq or Afaqi, and [[Kara Taghliq]] or Ishaqi), arose whose differences and war-making gestures, with the intermittent episode of the [[Oirats]] of [[Dzungaria]], make up much of recorded history in Kashgar until 1759. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] conquered Kashgar and set up the Khoja as their puppet rulers.\n\n=== Qing conquest ===\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] defeated the Dzungar Khanate during the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] and took control of Kashgar in 1759. The conquerors consolidated their authority by settling other ethnics emigrants in the vicinity of a [[Manchu]] garrison.\n\nRumours flew around Central Asia that the Qing planned to launch expeditions towards [[Transoxiana]] and Samarkand, the chiefs of which sought assistance from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] king [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]]. The alleged expedition never happened so Ahmad Shah withdrew his forces from Kokand. He also dispatched an ambassador to [[Beijing]] to discuss the situation of the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Afaqi Khojas]], but the representative was not well received, and Ahmed Shah was too busy fighting off the [[Sikhs]] to attempt to enforce his demands through arms.\n\nThe Qing continued to hold Kashgar with occasional interruptions during the [[Afaqi Khoja revolts]]. One of the most serious of these occurred in 1827, when the city was taken by [[Jahanghir Khoja]]; [[Chang-lung]], however, the Qing general of Ili, regained possession of Kashgar and the other rebellious cities in 1828. \n[[File:Kalmak archer.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Kalmyk Archer, Kashgar Army in the 1870s]]\n\nThe [[Kokand Khanate]] raided Kashgar several times. A revolt in 1829 under [[Mahommed Ali Khan]] and Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir resulted in the concession of several important trade privileges to the Muslims of the district of [[Altishahr]] (the \"six cities\"), as it was then called.\n\nThe area enjoyed relative calm until 1846 under the rule of [[Zahir-ud-din]], the local Uyghur governor, but in that year a new [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] revolt under [[Kath Tora]] led to his accession as the authoritarian ruler of the city. However, his reign was brief{{mdash}}at the end of seventy-five days, on the approach of the Chinese, he fled back to [[Khanate of Kokand|Khokand]] amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The last of the Khoja revolts (1857) was of about equal duration, and took place under [[Wali Khan (khoja)|Wali-Khan]], who murdered the well-known traveler [[Adolf Schlagintweit]].\n\n=== 1862 Chinese Hui revolt ===\nThe great [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]] involved insurrection among various Muslim ethnic groups. It broke out in 1862 in [[Gansu]] then spread rapidly to [[Dzungaria]] and through the line of towns in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n[[Dungan people|Dungan]] troops based in [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] rose and in August 1864 massacred some seven thousand Chinese and their Manchu commander. The inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against their masters, invoked the aid of [[Sadik Beg]], a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] chief, who was reinforced by [[Buzurg Khan]], the heir of [[Jahanghir Khoja]], and his general [[Yakub Beg]]. The latter men were dispatched at Sadik's request by the [[Alimqul|ruler of Khokand]] to raise what troops they could to aid his Muslim friends in Kashgar.\n\n[[File:Night interview with King.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Night interview with Yakub Beg, King of Kashgaria, 1868]]\n\nSadik Beg soon repented of having asked for a Khoja, and eventually marched against Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan delivered himself up to indolence and debauchery, but Yakub Beg, with singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of [[Yangishahr|Yangi Shahr]], [[Yangihissar|Yangi-Hissar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and other towns, and eventually became sole master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfit for the post of ruler.\n\nWith the overthrow of Chinese rule in 1865 by Yakub Beg (1820\u20131877), the manufacturing industries of Kashgar are supposed to have declined.\n\nYaqub Beg entered into relations and signed treaties with the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], but when he tried to get their support against China, he failed.\n\nKashgar and the other cities of the Tarim Basin remained under Yakub Beg's rule until May 1877, when he died at [[Korla]]. Thereafter Kashgaria was reconquered by the forces of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] general [[Zuo Zongtang]] during the [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang]].\n\n===Qing rule===\n\nThere were eras in Xinjiang's history where intermarriage was common, and \"laxity\" set upon Uyghur women led them to marry Chinese men in the period after Yakub Beg's rule ended. It is also believed by Uyghurs that some Uyghurs have Han Chinese ancestry from historical intermarriage, such as those living in [[Turpan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Joanne N.

Because they were viewed as \"outcast\", Islamic cemeteries banned the Uyghur wives of Chinese men from being buried within them. Uyghur women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as [[Hindus]], [[Armenians]], [[Jews]], [[Russians]], and [[Badakhshan]]is ([[Pamiri people|Pamiris]]) intermarried with local Uyghur women.<ref name=\"Bell\u00e9r-Hann2008\">{{cite book|author=Ildik\u00f3 Bell\u00e9r-Hann|title=Community Matters in Xinjiang, 1880-1949: Towards a Historical Anthropology of the Uyghur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4lMj8skvoC&pg=PA83|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-16675-0}}</ref>{{rp|84}} The local society accepted the Uyghur women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law.\n\nAn anti-Russian uproar broke out when Russian customs officials, 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Uyghur prostitutes to a party in January 1902 in Kashgar. There was a general anti-Russian sentiment, but the inflamed local Uyghur populace started a brawl with the Russians on the pretense of protecting their women. Even though morality was not strict in Kashgar, the local population confronted with the Russians before they were dispersed by guards, and the Chinese then sought to end tensions by preventing the Russians from building up a pretext to invade.<ref name=\"NightingaleSkrine2013\">{{cite book|author1=Pamela Nightingale|author2=C.P.

Previously Ma Zhancang arranged to have the Uighur leader [[Timur Beg]] killed and beheaded on August 9, 1933, displaying his head outside of [[Id Kah Mosque]].\n\n[[Han Chinese]] troops commanded by Brigadier Yang were absorbed into [[Ma Zhancang]]'s army.

It is one of the westernmost cities of China, near the border with [[Afghanistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[India]]. With a population of over 500,000, Kashgar has served as a trading post and strategically important city on the [[Silk Road]] between China, the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]] for over 2,000 years.\n\nAt the convergence point of widely varying cultures and empires, Kashgar has been under the rule of the Chinese, Turkic, Mongol and Tibetan empires. The city has also been the site of a number of battles between various groups of people on the steppes.\n\nNow administered as a county-level unit, Kashgar is the administrative centre of [[Kashgar Prefecture]], which has an area of {{convert|162000|km\u00b2}} and a population of approximately 4 million as of 2010.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkAVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA65|pages=65\u201366 |title=Eurasian Corridors of Interconnection: From the South China to the Caspian Sea|editors= Susan M.

The city was made into a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in 2010, the only city in western China with this distinction.

By the time covered by the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (roughly 25 to 170 CE), it had grown to 21,000 households and had 3,000 men able to bear arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' provides a wealth of detail on developments in the region:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{bquote|In the period of Emperor Wu [140-87 BC], the Western Regions1 were under the control of the Interior [China]. They numbered thirty-six kingdoms. The Imperial Government established a Colonel [in charge of] Envoys there to direct and protect these countries. Emperor Xuan [73-49 BC] changed this title [in 59 BC] to Protector-General.\n\nEmperor Yuan [40-33 BC] installed two Wuji Colonels to take charge of the agricultural garrisons on the frontiers of the king of Nearer Jushi [Turpan].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the time of Emperor Ai [6 BCE - 1 CE] and Emperor Ping [1 - 5 CE], the principalities of the Western Regions split up and formed fifty-five kingdoms. Wang Mang, after he usurped the Throne [in 9 CE], demoted and changed their kings and marquises. Following this, the Western Regions became resentful, and rebelled. They, therefore, broke off all relations with the Interior [China] and, all together, submitted to the Xiongnu again.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Xiongnu collected oppressively heavy taxes and the kingdoms were not able to support their demands. In the middle of the Jianwu period [AD 25-56], they each [Shanshan and Yarkand in 38, and 18 kingdoms in 45], sent envoys to ask if they could submit to the Interior [China], and to express their desire for a Protector-General. Emperor Guangwu, decided that because the Empire was not yet settled [after a long period of civil war], he had no time for outside affairs, and [therefore] finally refused his consent [in 45 CE].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the meantime, the Xiongnu became weaker. The king of Suoju [Yarkand], named Xian, wiped out several kingdoms. After Xian\u2019s death [c. 62 CE], they began to attack and fight each other. Xiao Yuan [Tura], Jingjue [Cadota], Ronglu [Niya], and Qiemo [Cherchen] were annexed by Shanshan [the Lop Nur region]. Qule [south of Keriya] and Pishan [modern Pishan or Guma] were conquered and fully occupied by Yutian [Khotan]. Yuli [Fukang], Danhuan, Guhu [Dawan Cheng], and Wutanzili were destroyed by Jushi [Turpan and Jimasa]. Later these kingdoms were re-established.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the Yongping period [58 - 75 CE], the Northern Xiongnu forced several countries to help them plunder the commanderies and districts of Hexi.

Then he appointed the Qiuci (Kucha) Marquis of the Left, Douti, King of Shule (Kashgar).\n\nIn winter 73 CE, the Han sent the Major [[Ban Chao]] who captured and bound Douti. He appointed Zhong, the son of the elder brother of Cheng, to be king of Shule (Kashgar). Zhong later rebelled. (Ban) Chao attacked and beheaded him.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}}}\n\n=== The Kushans ===\n[[File:Kashgar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Kashgar's Sunday market.]]\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' also gives the only extant historical record of [[Yuezhi]] or [[Kushan]] involvement in the Kashgar oasis:\n\n{{bquote|During the Yuanchu period (114-120) in the reign of Emperor, the king of Shule (Kashgar), exiled his maternal uncle Chenpan to the Yuezhi (Kushans) for some offence. The king of the Yuezhi became very fond of him. Later, Anguo died without leaving a son. His mother directed the government of the kingdom. She agreed with the people of the country to put Yifu (lit. \u201cposthumous child\u201d), who was the son of a full younger brother of Chenpan on the throne as king of Shule (Kashgar). Chenpan heard of this and appealed to the [[Yuezhi]] ([[Kushan]]) king, saying:\n\n: \"Anguo had no son. His relative (Yifu) is weak. If one wants to put on the throne a member of (Anguo\u2019s) mother\u2019s family, I am Yifu\u2019s paternal uncle, it is I who should be king.\"\n\nThe Yuezhi (Kushans) then sent soldiers to escort him back to Shule (Kashgar). The people had previously respected and been fond of Chenpan. Besides, they dreaded the Yuezhi (Kushans). They immediately took the seal and ribbon from Yifu and went to Chenpan, and made him king. Yifu was given the title of Marquis of the town of Pangao [90 li, or 37 km, from Shule].\n\nThen Suoju (Yarkand) continued to resist Yutian (Khotan), and put themselves under Shule (Kashgar). Thus Shule (Kashgar), became powerful and a rival to Qiuci (Kucha) and Yutian (Khotan).\"<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}\n}}\n\nHowever, it was not very long before the Chinese began to reassert their authority in the region:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yongjian year (127), during Emperor Shun\u2019s reign, Chenpan sent an envoy to respectfully present offerings. The Emperor bestowed on Chenpan the title of Great Commandant-in-Chief for the Han. Chenxun, who was the son of his elder brother, was appointed Temporary Major of the Kingdom.\n\nIn the fifth year (130), Chenpan sent his son to serve the Emperor and, along with envoys from Dayuan (Ferghana) and Suoju (Yarkand), brought tribute and offerings.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}}}\n\nFrom an earlier part of the same text comes the following addition:\n\n{{bquote|In the first Yangjia year (132), Xu You sent the king of Shule (Kashgar), Chenpan, who with 20,000 men, attacked and defeated Yutian (Khotan).

He replaced the king [of Jumi] by installing Chengguo from the family of [the previous king] Xing, and then he returned.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|15}}}}\n\nThen the first passage continues:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yangjia year (133), Chenpan again made offerings (including) a lion and zebu cattle.\n\nThen, during Emperor Ling\u2019s reign, in the first Jianning year [168], the king of Shule (Kashgar) and Commandant-in-Chief for the Han (i.e. presumably Chenpan), was killed while hunting by the youngest of his paternal uncles, Hede. Hede named himself king.\n\nIn the third year (170), Meng Tuo, the Inspector of Liangzhou, sent the Provincial Officer Ren She, commanding five hundred soldiers from Dunhuang, with the Wuji Major Cao Kuan, and Chief Clerk of the Western Regions, Zhang Yan, brought troops from Yanqi ([[Karashahr]]), Qiuci (Kucha), and the Nearer and Further States of Jushi (Turpan and Jimasa), altogether numbering more than 30,000, to punish Shule (Kashgar). They attacked the town of Zhenzhong [Arach \u2212 near Maralbashi] but, having stayed for more than forty days without being able to subdue it, they withdrew. Following this, the kings of Shule (Kashgar) killed one another repeatedly while the Imperial Government was unable to prevent it.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43, 45}}}}\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to the Sui dynasty ===\nThese centuries are marked by a general silence in sources on Kashgar and the Tarim Basin.\n\nThe ''[[Weil\u00fce]]'', composed in the second third of the 3rd century, mentions a number of states as dependencies of Kashgar: the kingdom of Zhenzhong (Arach?), the kingdom of Suoju (Yarkand), the kingdom of Jieshi, the kingdom of Qusha, the kingdom of Xiye (Khargalik), the kingdom of Yinai (Tashkurghan), the kingdom of Manli (modern Karasul), the kingdom of Yire (Mazar \u2212 also known as T\u00e1gh N\u00e1k and Tokanak), the kingdom of Yuling, the kingdom of Juandu (\u2018Tax Control\u2019 \u2212 near modern Irkeshtam), the kingdom of Xiuxiu (\u2018Excellent Rest Stop\u2019 \u2212 near Karakavak), and the kingdom of Qin.\n\nHowever, much of the information on the Western Regions contained in the ''Weil\u00fce'' seems to have ended roughly about (170), near the end of Han power. So, we cannot be sure that this is a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms.\n\nChapter 30 of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' says that after the beginning of the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] (220) the states of the Western Regions did not arrive as before, except for the larger ones such as [[Kucha]], [[Khotan]], [[Kangju]], [[Wusun]], Kashgar, [[Yuezhi]], [[Shanshan]] and [[Turpan]], who are said to have come to present tribute every year, as in Han times.\n\n[[File:Silk Road 1992.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Camels traversing the old [[silk road]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 270, four states from the Western Regions were said to have presented tribute: [[Karashahr]], [[Turpan]], [[Shanshan]], and [[Kucha]]. Some wooden documents from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] seem to indicate that contacts were also maintained with Kashgar and Khotan around this time.\n\nIn 422, according to the ''Songshu'', ch. 98, the king of Shanshan, Bilong, came to the court and \"the thirty-six states in the Western Regions\" all swore their allegiance and presented tribute. It must be assumed that these 36 states included Kashgar.\n\nThe \"Songji\" of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]] records that in the 5th month of 435, nine states: Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all came to the Wei court.\n\nIn 439, according to the ''Weishu'', ch. 4A, Shanshan, Kashgar and Karashahr sent envoys to present tribute.\n\nAccording to the ''Weishu'', ch. 102, Chapter on the Western Regions, the kingdoms of Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all began sending envoys to present tribute in the Taiyuan reign period (435-440).\n\nIn 453 Kashgar sent envoys to present tribute (''Weishu'', ch. 5), and again in 455.\n\nAn embassy sent during the reign of Wencheng Di (452-466) from the king of Kashgar presented a supposed sacred relic of the Buddha; a dress which was incombustible.\n\nIn 507 Kashgar, is said to have sent envoys in both the 9th and 10th months (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nIn 512, Kashgar sent envoys in the 1st and 5th months. (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nEarly in the 6th century Kashgar is included among the many territories controlled by the Yeda or [[Hephthalite]] Huns, but their empire collapsed at the onslaught of the Western Turks between 563 and 567 who then probably gained control over Kashgar and most of the states in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n===Tang dynasty===\n{{Main|Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|Tang campaign against the oasis states|l2=oasis states|Conquest of the Western Turks}}\n\nThe founding of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 saw the beginning of a prolonged struggle between China and the Western Turks for control of the Tarim Basin. In 635, the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tang Annals]]'' reported an emissary from the king of Kashgar to the Tang capital. In 639 there was a second emissary bringing products of Kashgar as a token of submission to the Tang state.\n\nBuddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]] passed through Kashgar (which he referred to as ''Ka-sha'') in 644 on his return journey from [[India]] to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to decay in India, was active in Kashgar. Xuanzang recorded that they flattened their babies heads, tattooed their bodies and had green eyes. He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen stuffs and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was different from that of other countries. The inhabitants were sincere Buddhist adherents and there were some hundreds of monasteries with more than 10,000 followers, all members of the [[Sarvastivadin]] School.\n\nAt around the same era, [[Nestorian Christians]] were establishing bishoprics at [[Herat]], [[Merv]] and [[Samarkand]], whence they subsequently proceeded to Kashgar, and finally to [[China proper]] itself.\n\nIn 646, the Turkic Kagan asked for the hand of a Tang Chinese princess, and in return the Emperor promised Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, Karashahr and Sarikol as a marriage gift, but this did not happen as planned.\n\nIn a series of campaigns between 652 and 658, with the help of the Uyghurs, the Chinese finally [[Conquest of the Western Turks|defeated the Western Turk tribes]] and took control of all their domains, including the Tarim Basin kingdoms. [[Karakhoja]] was [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexed in 640]], [[Karashahr]] during campaigns [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|in 644]] and 648, and [[Tang campaign against Kucha|Kucha fell]] in 648.\n\nIn 662 a rebellion broke out in the Western Regions and a Chinese army sent to control it was defeated by the [[Tibet]]ans south of Kashgar.\n\nAfter another defeat of the Tang Chinese forces in 670, the Tibetans gained control of the whole region and completely subjugated Kashgar in 676-8 and retained possession of it until 692, when the Tang dynasty regained control of all their former territories, and retained it for the next fifty years.\n\nIn 722 Kashgar sent 4,000 troops to assist the Chinese to force the \"Tibetans out of \"Little Bolu\" or [[Gilgit, Pakistan|Gilgit]].\n\nIn 728, the king of Kashgar was awarded a brevet by the Chinese emperor.\n\nIn 739, the ''Tangshu'' relates that the governor of the Chinese garrison in Kashgar, with the help of Ferghana, was interfering in the affairs of the [[Turgesh]] tribes as far as [[Taraz|Talas]].\n\n[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d08.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Mosque entrance in old Kashgar]]\n\nIn 751 the Chinese were defeated by an Arab army in the [[Battle of Talas]]. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] led to the decline of Tang influence in Central Asia due to the fact that the Tang dynasty was forced to withdraw its troops from the region to fight An Lushan. The Tibetans cut all communication between China and the West in 766.\n\nSoon after the Chinese pilgrim monk Wukong passed through Kashgar in 753. He again reached Kashgar on his return trip from India in 786 and mentions a Chinese deputy governor as well as the local king.\n\n===Battles with Arab Caliphate===\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nIn 711, the Arabs invaded Kashgar.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PT798&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places  |editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger |page=598 |publisher=Routledge|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-884964-04-6 }}</ref> It is alleged that [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] in 712-715 had conquered Xinjiang.<ref name=\"Dillon2014\">{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=Xinjiang and the Expansion of Chinese Communist Power: Kashgar in the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2MtBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-64721-8|pages=7\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Broomhall1910\">{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan & Scott, Limited|pages=17\u2013}}</ref> Although the Muslim religion from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless made its weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and east, and thus acquired a steadily growing influence.

After his death, Kashgar came under the rule of the [[Chagatai Khans]]. [[Marco Polo]] visited the city, which he calls ''Cascar'', about 1273-4 and recorded the presence of numerous [[Nestorian Christians]], who had their own churches. Later In the 14th century, a Chagataid khan [[Tughluq Timur]] converted to Islam, and Islamic tradition began to reassert its ascendancy.\n\n[[File:Kashgar road scene, 1870s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Kashgar road scene, 1870s]]\n\nIn 1389\u22121390 [[Tamerlane]] ravaged Kashgar, [[Andijan]] and the intervening country. Kashgar endured a troubled time, and in 1514, on the invasion of the Khan [[Sultan Said Khan|Sultan Said]], was destroyed by [[Mirza Ababakar]], who with the aid of ten thousand men built a new fort with massive defences higher up on the banks of the [[Tuman river]]. The dynasty of the Chagatai Khans collapsed in 1572 with the division of the country among rival factions; soon after, two powerful [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] factions, the White and Black Mountaineers ([[Ak Tagh]]liq or Afaqi, and [[Kara Taghliq]] or Ishaqi), arose whose differences and war-making gestures, with the intermittent episode of the [[Oirats]] of [[Dzungaria]], make up much of recorded history in Kashgar until 1759. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] conquered Kashgar and set up the Khoja as their puppet rulers.\n\n=== Qing conquest ===\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] defeated the Dzungar Khanate during the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] and took control of Kashgar in 1759. The conquerors consolidated their authority by settling other ethnics emigrants in the vicinity of a [[Manchu]] garrison.\n\nRumours flew around Central Asia that the Qing planned to launch expeditions towards [[Transoxiana]] and Samarkand, the chiefs of which sought assistance from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] king [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]]. The alleged expedition never happened so Ahmad Shah withdrew his forces from Kokand. He also dispatched an ambassador to [[Beijing]] to discuss the situation of the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Afaqi Khojas]], but the representative was not well received, and Ahmed Shah was too busy fighting off the [[Sikhs]] to attempt to enforce his demands through arms.\n\nThe Qing continued to hold Kashgar with occasional interruptions during the [[Afaqi Khoja revolts]]. One of the most serious of these occurred in 1827, when the city was taken by [[Jahanghir Khoja]]; [[Chang-lung]], however, the Qing general of Ili, regained possession of Kashgar and the other rebellious cities in 1828. \n[[File:Kalmak archer.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Kalmyk Archer, Kashgar Army in the 1870s]]\n\nThe [[Kokand Khanate]] raided Kashgar several times. A revolt in 1829 under [[Mahommed Ali Khan]] and Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir resulted in the concession of several important trade privileges to the Muslims of the district of [[Altishahr]] (the \"six cities\"), as it was then called.\n\nThe area enjoyed relative calm until 1846 under the rule of [[Zahir-ud-din]], the local Uyghur governor, but in that year a new [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] revolt under [[Kath Tora]] led to his accession as the authoritarian ruler of the city. However, his reign was brief{{mdash}}at the end of seventy-five days, on the approach of the Chinese, he fled back to [[Khanate of Kokand|Khokand]] amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The last of the Khoja revolts (1857) was of about equal duration, and took place under [[Wali Khan (khoja)|Wali-Khan]], who murdered the well-known traveler [[Adolf Schlagintweit]].\n\n=== 1862 Chinese Hui revolt ===\nThe great [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]] involved insurrection among various Muslim ethnic groups. It broke out in 1862 in [[Gansu]] then spread rapidly to [[Dzungaria]] and through the line of towns in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n[[Dungan people|Dungan]] troops based in [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] rose and in August 1864 massacred some seven thousand Chinese and their Manchu commander. The inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against their masters, invoked the aid of [[Sadik Beg]], a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] chief, who was reinforced by [[Buzurg Khan]], the heir of [[Jahanghir Khoja]], and his general [[Yakub Beg]]. The latter men were dispatched at Sadik's request by the [[Alimqul|ruler of Khokand]] to raise what troops they could to aid his Muslim friends in Kashgar.\n\n[[File:Night interview with King.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Night interview with Yakub Beg, King of Kashgaria, 1868]]\n\nSadik Beg soon repented of having asked for a Khoja, and eventually marched against Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan delivered himself up to indolence and debauchery, but Yakub Beg, with singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of [[Yangishahr|Yangi Shahr]], [[Yangihissar|Yangi-Hissar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and other towns, and eventually became sole master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfit for the post of ruler.\n\nWith the overthrow of Chinese rule in 1865 by Yakub Beg (1820\u20131877), the manufacturing industries of Kashgar are supposed to have declined.\n\nYaqub Beg entered into relations and signed treaties with the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], but when he tried to get their support against China, he failed.\n\nKashgar and the other cities of the Tarim Basin remained under Yakub Beg's rule until May 1877, when he died at [[Korla]]. Thereafter Kashgaria was reconquered by the forces of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] general [[Zuo Zongtang]] during the [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang]].\n\n===Qing rule===\n\nThere were eras in Xinjiang's history where intermarriage was common, and \"laxity\" set upon Uyghur women led them to marry Chinese men in the period after Yakub Beg's rule ended. It is also believed by Uyghurs that some Uyghurs have Han Chinese ancestry from historical intermarriage, such as those living in [[Turpan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Joanne N.

Because they were viewed as \"outcast\", Islamic cemeteries banned the Uyghur wives of Chinese men from being buried within them. Uyghur women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as [[Hindus]], [[Armenians]], [[Jews]], [[Russians]], and [[Badakhshan]]is ([[Pamiri people|Pamiris]]) intermarried with local Uyghur women.<ref name=\"Bell\u00e9r-Hann2008\">{{cite book|author=Ildik\u00f3 Bell\u00e9r-Hann|title=Community Matters in Xinjiang, 1880-1949: Towards a Historical Anthropology of the Uyghur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4lMj8skvoC&pg=PA83|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-16675-0}}</ref>{{rp|84}} The local society accepted the Uyghur women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law.\n\nAn anti-Russian uproar broke out when Russian customs officials, 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Uyghur prostitutes to a party in January 1902 in Kashgar.

They live in a small, modestly furnished apartment in [[Helsinki]]. As they come home from work late one night, Lauri surprises Ilona with a television which he purchased on [[hire purchase]]. They talk about whether they can meet their financial obligations, but agree that the TV payments are manageable.\n\nNext day, as Lauri gets to work, he learns that the company will be laying off workers due to the non-profitability of certain tram routes and he is randomly chosen as one of those. The day after Lauri has finished his last shift, Ilona is informed by the owner of ''Dubrovnik'' that the restaurant is being sold to a chain and that all employees will be let go since the new company will be bringing in its own staff.\n\nBoth start looking for work but with discouraging results. Lauri is offered a job as a bus driver but is unable to pass the medical exam and subsequently loses his professional driver's licence. Ilona gets a job at a rundown bar/restaurant which does not even have a name and is owned by a tax-evading crook. After six weeks, the restaurant gets shut down by the government and Ilona is not paid by the dishonest owner.\n\nDuring their search for employment, Lauri and Ilona have bouts of heavy-drinking, all the while running into former colleagues who have similar difficulties. At one point, the two even sell their car and take the proceedings to a casino in hopes of doubling the money but end up losing it all. Most of their furniture, as well as the new TV that Lauri bought, is repossessed.\n\nOne day, Ilona accidentally runs into Mrs Sj\u00f6holm ([[Elina Salo]]), her former boss. Sj\u00f6holm suggests that Ilona open up a restaurant. Since Ilona does not have the means for such a venture, Sj\u00f6holm agrees to provide the capital as a loan. Ilona, humbled by her recent experiences, is initially reluctant to accept for fear of the restaurant failing and her not being able to repay Mrs Sj\u00f6holm, but eventually agrees.\n\nIlona names the restaurant ''Work'' and hires some of the staff from ''Dubrovnik'', including the troubled chef, Lajunen ([[Markku Peltola]]), plus Lauri. Filled with anxiety during a slow lunch hour on opening day, Ilona's worries disappear as she watches the restaurant fill to capacity later the same afternoon. After receiving a call from a Helsinki union asking for a reservation for thirty people, Lauri and Ilona stand on the front steps of the restaurant appearing emotionless, looking at the skies as more people enter.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Kati Outinen]] - Ilona Koponen\n*[[Kari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen]] - Lauri Koponen\n*[[Elina Salo]] - Rouva Sj\u00f6holm\n*[[Sakari Kuosmanen]] - Melartin\n*[[Markku Peltola]] - Lajunen\n*[[Matti Onnismaa]] - Forsstr\u00f6m\n*[[Shelley Fisher]] - Pianist\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nAlthough the film was not as widely distributed as an average [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood feature]] and, as a result, was not a commercial success to the same extent, it was well received by film critics worldwide while also winning several major film awards.

They live in a small, modestly furnished apartment in [[Helsinki]]. As they come home from work late one night, Lauri surprises Ilona with a television which he purchased on [[hire purchase]]. They talk about whether they can meet their financial obligations, but agree that the TV payments are manageable.\n\nNext day, as Lauri gets to work, he learns that the company will be laying off workers due to the non-profitability of certain tram routes and he is randomly chosen as one of those. The day after Lauri has finished his last shift, Ilona is informed by the owner of ''Dubrovnik'' that the restaurant is being sold to a chain and that all employees will be let go since the new company will be bringing in its own staff.\n\nBoth start looking for work but with discouraging results. Lauri is offered a job as a bus driver but is unable to pass the medical exam and subsequently loses his professional driver's licence. Ilona gets a job at a rundown bar/restaurant which does not even have a name and is owned by a tax-evading crook. After six weeks, the restaurant gets shut down by the government and Ilona is not paid by the dishonest owner.\n\nDuring their search for employment, Lauri and Ilona enter bouts of heavy-drinking, all the while running into former colleagues who have similar difficulties. At one point, the two even sell their car and take the proceedings to a casino in hopes of doubling the money but end up losing it all. Most of their furniture, as well as the new TV that Lauri bought, is repossessed.\n\nOne day, Ilona accidentally runs into Mrs Sj\u00f6holm ([[Elina Salo]]), her former boss. Sj\u00f6holm suggests that Ilona open up a restaurant. Since Ilona does not have the means for such a venture, Sj\u00f6holm agrees to provide the capital as a loan. Ilona, humbled by her recent experiences, is initially reluctant to accept for fear of the restaurant failing and her not being able to repay Mrs Sj\u00f6holm, but eventually agrees.\n\nIlona names the restaurant ''Work'' and hires some of the staff from ''Dubrovnik'', including the troubled chef, Lajunen ([[Markku Peltola]]), plus Lauri. Filled with anxiety during a slow lunch hour on opening day, Ilona's worries disappear as she watches the restaurant fill to capacity later the same afternoon. After receiving a call from a Helsinki union asking for a reservation for thirty people, Lauri and Ilona stand on the front steps of the restaurant appearing emotionless, looking at the skies as more people enter.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Kati Outinen]] - Ilona Koponen\n*[[Kari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen]] - Lauri Koponen\n*[[Elina Salo]] - Rouva Sj\u00f6holm\n*[[Sakari Kuosmanen]] - Melartin\n*[[Markku Peltola]] - Lajunen\n*[[Matti Onnismaa]] - Forsstr\u00f6m\n*[[Shelley Fisher]] - Pianist\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nAlthough the film was not as widely distributed as an average [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood feature]] and, as a result, was not a commercial success to the same extent, it was well received by film critics worldwide while also winning several major film awards.

wrestler]] currently signed to [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide]] (AAA), under the [[ring name]] '''Cinta de Oro''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"Golden Ribbon\"). He is best known for his time with [[WWE]] under the ring name '''Sin Cara''' (Spanish for \"Faceless\"), where he was the second and longest-tenured wrestler to use the persona.<ref name=\"WWE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/sin-cara |title=Sin Cara |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |work=[[WWE]]}}</ref><ref name=\"FCW\" />\n\nPrior to his signing with WWE, Arias wrestled under the ring name '''M\u00edstico''' or '''Mystico''' (Spanish for \"Mystic\") under which he worked for [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[professional wrestling promotion]] AAA and various [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]] in the [[United States]] and Mexico. During this time, he had problems with [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|CMLL]] wrestler [[Car\u00edstico|Luis Urive]], who also worked under the ring name of M\u00edstico. Following a dispute, Arias changed his ring name to '''M\u00edstico de Juarez''' and later to '''Incognito''', under which he wrestled in promotions like [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Chikara]], [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]].\n\nArias signed with WWE in 2009 and debuted on the main roster in 2011 as Sin Cara, temporarily replacing the original performer of the character Luis Urive. Arias subsequently lost a Mask vs. Mask match against Urive and began wrestling unmasked under the ring name '''Hunico'''. In 2013, after the release of Urive, Arias reprised his role as Sin Cara. In contrast to Urive, Arias' portrayal of Sin Cara was [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] due to Arias having grown up in the [[United States]], and thus knowing how to speak both Spanish or English, and doing so depending on the intended audience, whereas Urive legitimately did not know English. In 2014, Arias won the [[NXT Tag Team Championship]] alongside [[Kalisto (wrestler)|Kalisto]] as a part of [[The Lucha Dragons]].

He studied at the French College in Plovdiv, where he received the nickname ''Michel''.  As a student in 1893 he started his revolutionary activities as the leader of a [[Macedonian Secret Revolutionary Committee]] (MSRC).<ref>Black flame: the revolutionary class politics of anarchism and syndicalism, Lucien van der Walt, Michael Schmidt, AK Press, 2009, {{ISBN|1-904859-16-X}}, p. 317.</ref> Later Gerdzhikov studied in Switzerland ([[Lausanne]] and [[Geneva]]), where he made close connections with the revolutionary immigration and established the so-called ''Geneva group'', an extension of MSRC.\n\nGerdzhikov was under strong [[anarchist]] influence and rejected the nationalism of the ethnic minorities in the [[Ottoman Empire]], favouring alliances with ordinary Muslim people against the [[Sultanate]] and the idea about a [[Balkan Federation]]. In 1899 he came back to the Balkans and worked as a teacher in [[Bitola]]. Gerdzhikov became a member of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and a close friend of [[Gotse Delchev]]. He was the mastermind and leader of the peasant [[Preobrazhenie Uprising]] in July 1903, a revolt against the Ottoman authorities in [[Thrace]]. Gerdzhikov's forces, about 2,000 strong and poorly armed, managed to establish a \u201c[[Strandzha commune]]\u201d. In 1919 the Federation of Anarchist Communists of Bulgaria (FAKB) was founded at a congress opened by   Gerdzhikov. In 1925 he was among the founders of [[IMRO (United)]] in Vienna.\n\nGerdzhikov had invested high hopes in the new Socialist system after 1944, but was soon disappointed by the newly established regime. He died in 1947 in [[Sofia]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Mihail Gerdzhikov by Georgi Danchov, 1881.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Portrait of the young Mihail Gerdzhikov from the photo gallery of [[Georgi Danchov]]]]\n\nGerdzhikov was born in 1877 in [[Plovdiv]] as the first child in the family of Ivan Pavlov Gerdzhikov and Magdalen Ilyich. He spent his childhood in Plovdiv, where he discovered the ideas of [[anarchism]]. He was strongly influenced by Dr. Rusel Sudzilovski, a personal friend of [[Hristo Botev]], who resided in his home for some time. As a student influenced by left-wing ideas, he created an anarchist group in the Plovdiv High School in 1895, for which he was expelled. At the end of the same year, he connected with Macedonian high school students in the city and, together with his other classmates, followed the revolutionary movement of the Pre-Liberation era, with a strongly anarchist focus.\n\n[[File: Mihail Gerdzhikov cheta IMARO.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Mikhail Gerdzhikov's troops during the Ilinden-Transfiguration Uprising]]\n[[File: Mihail, Stefan and Nikolay Gerdzhikov by Andrey Andreev, 1904.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Brothers Michael, Stefan and Nikolay Gerdzhikov, photographer [[Andrey Andreev (photographer) | Andrey Andreev]], Plovdiv]]\n[[File: Mihail Gerdzhikov cheta IMARO2.jpg|thumb|250px|Mikhail Gerdzhikov's Cheta]]\n\nGerdzhikov then went straight to [[Lausanne]] and [[Geneva]], where he participated in the so-called ''Geneva Group''.

When it was discovered by the Ottoman authorities, Gerdzhikov joined [[Hristo Chernopeev]]'s company. Shortly thereafter, he formed a detachment in the [[Gevgelija]] region.\n\nIn April 1901 he was a delegate of the Borisov Society to the ''Eighth Macedonian-Edirne Congress''. <ref> Bilyarski, Tsocho.

Since the summer of 1902 he has been managing and organizing the organization in Edirne, assisted by the sub-divisions of [[Ivan Varnaliev]] and [[Hristo Silyanov]].\n\nAt the ''Petrova Niva Congress'', he was elected a member of the district's leading military unit and was one of the leaders in the preparation and conduct of the [[Preobrazhenie Uprising]]. \n\nOn 19 February 1903, Gerdzhikov led a 25-man squad to make an assassination attempt at the Constantinople-Edirne railway line outside the revolutionary Thracian territory at [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksinekli, Silivri]] Station\nHe participated in the uprising itself, leading a group of 80 people from [[Kitka Peak]] to [[Strandzha]] an establishing the so-called [[Strandzha commune]]. Within a short time, Turkish rule throughout the Strandzha region was abolished except for in [[Malko Turnovo]]. Turkish posts along the border were destroyed, and village garrisons were expelled and the entire organizational territory in the area was liberated.\n\nAfter the defeat of the uprising he dealt with the accommodation of the rebels who withdrew to Bulgaria. He published articles in the Bulgarian and foreign press, appealing to the international community for intervention in the resolution of the [[Eastern question]] in the Balkans. Together with [[Varban Kilifarski]] he also published various newspapers of their own. <ref> Karchev, Peter.

He studied at the French College in Plovdiv, where he received the nickname ''Michel''.  As a student in 1893 he started his revolutionary activities as the leader of a [[Macedonian Secret Revolutionary Committee]] (MSRC).<ref>Black flame: the revolutionary class politics of anarchism and syndicalism, Lucien van der Walt, Michael Schmidt, AK Press, 2009, {{ISBN|1-904859-16-X}}, p. 317.</ref> Later Gerdzhikov studied in Switzerland ([[Lausanne]] and [[Geneva]]), where he made close connections with the revolutionary immigration and established the so-called ''Geneva group'', an extension of MSRC.\n\nGerdzhikov was under strong [[anarchist]] influence and rejected the nationalism of the ethnic minorities in the [[Ottoman Empire]], favouring alliances with ordinary Muslim people against the [[Sultanate]] and the idea about a [[Balkan Federation]]. In 1899 he came back to the Balkans and worked as a teacher in [[Bitola]]. Gerdzhikov became a member of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and a close friend of [[Gotse Delchev]]. He was the mastermind and leader of the peasant [[Preobrazhenie Uprising]] in July 1903, a revolt against the Ottoman authorities in [[Thrace]]. Gerdzhikov's forces, about 2,000 strong and poorly armed, managed to establish a \u201c[[Strandzha commune]]\u201d. In 1919 the Federation of Anarchist Communists of Bulgaria (FAKB) was founded at a congress opened by   Gerdzhikov. In 1925 he was among the founders of [[IMRO (United)]] in Vienna.\n\nGerdzhikov had invested high hopes in the new Socialist system after 1944, but was soon disappointed by the newly established regime. He died in 1947 in [[Sofia]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Mihail Gerdzhikov by Georgi Danchov, 1881.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Portrait of the young Mihail Gerdzhikov from the photo gallery of [[Georgi Danchov]]]]\n\nGerdzhikov was born in 1877 in [[Plovdiv]] as the first child in the family of Ivan Pavlov Gerdzhikov and Magdalen Ilyich. He spent his childhood in Plovdiv, where he discovered the ideas of [[anarchism]]. He was strongly influenced by Dr. Rusel Sudzilovski, a personal friend of [[Hristo Botev]], who resided in his home for some time. As a student influenced by left-wing ideas, he created an anarchist group in the Plovdiv High School in 1895, for which he was expelled. At the end of the same year, he connected with Macedonian high school students in the city and, together with his other classmates, followed the revolutionary movement of the Pre-Liberation era, with a strongly anarchist focus.\n\n[[File: Mihail Gerdzhikov cheta IMARO.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Mikhail Gerdzhikov's troops during the Ilinden-Transfiguration Uprising]]\n[[File: Mihail, Stefan and Nikolay Gerdzhikov by Andrey Andreev, 1904.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Brothers Michael, Stefan and Nikolay Gerdzhikov, photographer [[Andrey Andreev (photographer) | Andrey Andreev]], Plovdiv]]\n[[File: Mihail Gerdzhikov cheta IMARO2.jpg|thumb|250px|Mikhail Gerdzhikov's Cheta]]\n\nGerdzhikov then went straight to [[Lausanne]] and [[Geneva]], where he participated in the so-called ''Geneva Group''.

Since the summer of 1902 he has been managing and organizing the organization in Edirne, assisted by the sub-divisions of [[Ivan Varnaliev]] and [[Hristo Silyanov]].\n\nAt the ''Petrova Niva Congress'', he was elected a member of the district's leading military unit and was one of the leaders in the preparation and conduct of the [[Preobrazhenie Uprising]]. \n\nOn 19 February 1903, Gerdzhikov led a 25-man squad to make an assassination attempt at the Constantinople-Edirne railway line outside the revolutionary Thracian territory at [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksinekli, Silivri]] Station\nHe participated in the uprising itself, leading a group of 80 people from [[Kitka Peak]] to [[Strandzha]] an establishing the so-called [[Strandzha commune]]. Within a short time, Turkish rule throughout the Strandzha region was abolished except for in [[Malko Turnovo]]. Turkish posts along the border were destroyed, and village garrisons were expelled and the entire organizational territory in the area was liberated.\n\nAfter the defeat of the uprising he dealt with the accommodation of the rebels who withdrew to Bulgaria. He published articles in the Bulgarian and foreign press, appealing to the international community for intervention in the resolution of the [[Eastern question]] in the Balkans. Together with [[Varban Kilifarski]] he also published various newspapers of their own. <ref> Karchev, Peter.

As well as the Dennis Bridge, this project included a {{convert|10|km|mi|0|adj=on}} deviation of the Pacific Highway and a {{convert|3|km|mi|0|adj=on|spell=on}} connecting road from the old to the new highway route, Hastings River Drive.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', Vol. 27, p. 80.</ref>\n\nThe bridge was named after [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] engineer Spencer Dennis, and is one of a series of steel truss bridges of standardised design erected by the then-Department of Main Roads in the 1950s and 1960s, predominantly across the wide coastal rivers of New South Wales.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Denis Bridge Port Macquarie.png|thumb|Approaches to the Dennis Bridge in 2018]]\nThe Dennis Bridge has a total length of {{convert|468|m|ft|0}}, and consists of six {{convert|37|m|ft|0|adj=on}} truss spans and one {{convert|25.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} truss span, as well as ten steel plate girder approach spans.
