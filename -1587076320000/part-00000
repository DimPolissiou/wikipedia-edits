For example, treasure hunters try to find sunken [[shipwreck]]s and retrieve artifacts with market value. This industry is generally fueled by the market for antiquities. The practice of treasure-hunting can be controversial, as locations such as sunken wrecks or cultural sites may be protected by national or international law concerned with property ownership, [[marine salvage]], sovereign or state vessels, commercial diving regulations, protection of cultural heritage and trade controls.\n\nTreasure hunting can also refer to [[geocaching]] {{ndash}} a sport in which participants :)use [[GPS]] units to find hidden caches of trinkets, or various other [[treasure hunt (game)|treasure-hunting games]].\n\n==Actors==\nSince the late 1990s, reacting against increasingly energetic efforts by the international community to stop the destruction of the world submerged cultural heritage, treasure hunting companies started hiring [[archaeologist]]s and marketing directors, making public statements about their good intentions. Even where good quality archaeological research is carried out by archaeologists working with treasure hunters, concerns remain that treasure hunting, by definition, ignores the principle that in-situ preservation of cultural heritage should always be considered first, and that the sale of recovered artifacts breaks up the assemblage of cultural heritage material, resulting in a loss of opportunity to study the whole picture.   The counter argument is that professional salvors have the resources to fund archaeological research of sites that would otherwise be unrecorded, and be subject to destruction by looting or natural forces.\n\n[[Image:Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|upright|Treasure hunter [[Heinrich Schliemann]]]]\nThe early stages of the development of [[archaeology]] included a significant aspect of treasure hunting; [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s excavations at [[Troy]], and later at [[Mycenae]], both turned up significant finds of [[gold]]en artifacts. Early work in [[Egyptology]] also included a similar motive. Modern amateur treasure hunters use relatively inexpensive metal detectors to locate finds at terrestrial sites.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bruce|first1=Sarah|title=On first time out with his metal detector, amateur treasure hunter finds \u00a31m hoard of ancient golden jewellery|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1225271/David-Booths-1m-gold-Stirlingshire-Amateur-treasure-hunter-finds-hoard-ancient-jewellery|accessdate=13 July 2016|publisher=Daily Mail|date=5 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Underwater archaeologist]] and sometime treasure hunter [[Peter Throckmorton]], in a paper he wrote in 1969 as part of a ''Historical Archaeology Forum'' on [[E.

For example, treasure hunters try to find sunken [[shipwreck]]s and retrieve artifacts with market value. This industry is generally fueled by the market for antiquities. The practice of treasure-hunting can be controversial, as locations such as sunken wrecks or cultural sites may be protected by national or international law concerned with property ownership, [[marine salvage]], sovereign or state vessels, commercial diving regulations, protection of cultural heritage and trade controls.\n\nTreasure hunting can also refer to [[geocaching]] {{ndash}} a sport in which participants use [[GPS]] units to find hidden caches of toys or trinkets, or various other [[treasure hunt (game)|treasure-hunting games]].\n\n==Actors==\nSince the late 1990s, reacting against increasingly energetic efforts by the international community to stop the destruction of the world submerged cultural heritage, treasure hunting companies started hiring [[archaeologist]]s and marketing directors, making public statements about their good intentions. Even where good quality archaeological research is carried out by archaeologists working with treasure hunters, concerns remain that treasure hunting, by definition, ignores the principle that in-situ preservation of cultural heritage should always be considered first, and that the sale of recovered artifacts breaks up the assemblage of cultural heritage material, resulting in a loss of opportunity to study the whole picture.   The counter argument is that professional salvors have the resources to fund archaeological research of sites that would otherwise be unrecorded, and be subject to destruction by looting or natural forces.\n\n[[Image:Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|upright|Treasure hunter [[Heinrich Schliemann]]]]\nThe early stages of the development of [[archaeology]] included a significant aspect of treasure hunting; [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s excavations at [[Troy]], and later at [[Mycenae]], both turned up significant finds of [[gold]]en artifacts. Early work in [[Egyptology]] also included a similar motive. Modern amateur treasure hunters use relatively inexpensive metal detectors to locate finds at terrestrial sites.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bruce|first1=Sarah|title=On first time out with his metal detector, amateur treasure hunter finds \u00a31m hoard of ancient golden jewellery|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1225271/David-Booths-1m-gold-Stirlingshire-Amateur-treasure-hunter-finds-hoard-ancient-jewellery|accessdate=13 July 2016|publisher=Daily Mail|date=5 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Underwater archaeologist]] and sometime treasure hunter [[Peter Throckmorton]], in a paper he wrote in 1969 as part of a ''Historical Archaeology Forum'' on [[E.

The work includes [[social commentary]] (especially about [[LGBTQ]] and women's perspectives, and mental illness), evocative speech punctuated by comedy and emotive narration of Gadsby's life, learnings and what her story offers to the world. In June 2018, [[Netflix]] released a [[video]] of Gadsby's performance of the work at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. Gadsby's live performances and the video have received critical acclaim for casting light on the realities behind several success stories that are only told from singular perspectives, and reflecting on inequality and oppression. In September 2019, Gadsby won [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special|Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special]] for ''Nanette'' at the annual [[71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Awards]].\n\n==Development==\nGadsby created the stand-up show she named ''Nanette'' partly as a response to the uncivil public debate which took place in Australia before the [[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017|law was changed to allow same-sex marriage]], and soon after her diagnosis of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[autism]].<ref name=ANU>{{cite web|publisher=Australian National University|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/alumni/our-alumni/spotlight/hannah-gadsby-ba-%E2%80%9803|title=Hannah Gadsby BA '03|date=29 March 2019|accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe show was originally named after a woman Gadsby had met,<ref name=ANU/> whom she thought could be turned into an hour's worth of material. During the writing process, she realized this wasn't the case, but the name had already been chosen. She ended up ignoring this inconsistency and wrote an hour of material unrelated to Nanette.<ref>{{cite AV media |work=[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Hannah Gadsby Got Into Comedy Because of a Broken Wrist|date=15 June 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdvTDlGLjCQ|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref> The initial shows were more combative with the audience, and made Gadsby feel victimised, so to get the audience more on their side they added more jokes and relieved more tension throughout the show's run.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Content==\nGadsby uses the piece to deconstruct the nature of comedy and asks the \"straight white male\" to undergo the same tension that marginalized people go through every day. She does this by explaining her experience as a [[lesbian]] and gender non-conforming woman. She explains that some are brought up to hate herselves, while others are brought up with the licence to hate others. Her realisation is that the self-deprecating humour common to standup comedy is doubly painful for marginalised people, because it is joining the chorus of people who insult and belittle them already. This lead her to conclude that they can no longer do standup comedy, and structures the piece around claiming she is giving up comedy. She has since stated that she\u2019s not doing so after all due to the surprising response to their show.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |title=Hannah Gadsby Chats About Her Netflix Special, 'Hannah Gadsby: Nanette'|date=19 June 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwcIon2flLU|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Performances==\nGadsby has performed ''Nanette'' throughout Australia, at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], and in the United States.

The work includes [[social commentary]] (especially about [[LGBTQ]] and women's perspectives, and mental illness), evocative speech punctuated by comedy and emotive narration of Gadsby's life, learnings and what her story offers to the world. In June 2018, [[Netflix]] released a [[video]] of Gadsby's performance of the work at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. Gadsby's live performances and the video have received critical acclaim for casting light on the realities behind several success stories that are only told from singular perspectives, and reflecting on inequality and oppression. In September 2019, Gadsby won [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special|Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special]] for ''Nanette'' at the annual [[71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Awards]].\n\n==Development==\nGadsby created the stand-up show she named ''Nanette'' partly as a response to the uncivil public debate which took place in Australia before the [[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017|law was changed to allow same-sex marriage]], and soon after her diagnosis of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[autism]].<ref name=ANU>{{cite web|publisher=Australian National University|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/alumni/our-alumni/spotlight/hannah-gadsby-ba-%E2%80%9803|title=Hannah Gadsby BA '03|date=29 March 2019|accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe show was originally named after a woman Gadsby had met,<ref name=ANU/> whom she thought could be turned into an hour's worth of material.

She does this by explaining her experience as a [[lesbian]] and gender non-conforming woman. She explains that some are brought up to hate herselves, while others are brought up with the licence to hate others. Her realisation is that the self-deprecating humour common to standup comedy is doubly painful for marginalised people, because it is joining the chorus of people who insult and belittle them already. This lead her to conclude that they can no longer do standup comedy, and structures the piece around claiming she is giving up comedy. She has since stated that she\u2019s not doing so after all due to the surprising response to their show.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |title=Hannah Gadsby Chats About Her Netflix Special, 'Hannah Gadsby: Nanette'|date=19 June 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwcIon2flLU|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Performances==\nGadsby has performed ''Nanette'' throughout Australia, at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], and in the United States.

The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i. e., the amount of [[fluid]] (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\n[[Three dimensional]] mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using [[arithmetic]] [[formula]]s<!--- both \"formulae\" and \"formulas\" are correct plurals of \"formula\" --->. Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with [[integral calculus]] if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. One-dimensional figures (such as [[line (mathematics)|lines]]) and [[two-dimensional]] shapes (such as [[square (geometry)|squares]]) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.\n\nThe volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by [[Displacement (fluid)|fluid displacement]]. Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas. The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of just one of the substances. However, sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and in such cases the combined volume is not [[additive map|additive]].<ref>One litre of sugar (about 970 grams) can dissolve in 0.6 litres of hot water, producing a total volume of less than one litre. {{cite web |url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch18/soluble.php |title=Solubility |accessdate=2010-05-01 |quote=Up to 1800 grams of sucrose can dissolve in a liter of water.}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[differential geometry]]'', volume is expressed by means of the [[volume form]], and is an important global [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].\nIn ''[[thermodynamics]]'', volume is a [[gas volume|fundamental parameter]], and is a [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variable]] to [[pressure]].\n\n==Units==\n{{main|unit of volume}}\n[[File:Volume measurements from The New Student's Reference Work.svg|thumb|220px|Volume measurements from the 1914 [[s:The New Student's Reference Work|The New Student's Reference Work]].\n\n{| style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"navbox\"\n|+ Approximate conversion to metric (mL)'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/appxc.cfm#4e |title=General Tables of Units of Measurement |author= |date= |work= |publisher=NIST Weights and Measures Division |accessdate=2011-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210164956/http://ts.nist.gov/weightsandmeasures/publications/appxc.cfm |archivedate=2011-12-10 |df= }}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |\n! rowspan=2 | {{abbr|Imp.|Imperial}}\n! colspan=2 | U.S.\n|-\n!

For example, a [[cubic centimetre]] (cm<sup>3</sup>) is the volume of a cube whose sides are one [[centimetre]] (1&nbsp;cm) in length.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre (m<sup>3</sup>).  The [[metric system]] also includes the [[litre]] (L) as a unit of volume, where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube.  Thus\n:1 litre = (10 cm)<sup>3</sup> = 1000 cubic centimetres = 0.001 cubic metres,\n\nso\n:1 cubic metre = 1000 litres.\nSmall amounts of liquid are often measured in [[millilitre]]s, where\n:1 millilitre = 0.001 litres = 1 cubic centimetre.\nIn the same way, large amounts can be measured in megalitres, where\n:1 million litres = 1000 cubic metres = 1 megalitre.\n\nVarious other traditional units of volume are also in use, including the [[cubic inch]], the [[cubic foot]], the [[cubic yard]], the [[cubic mile]], the [[teaspoon]], the [[tablespoon]], the [[fluid ounce]], the [[fluid dram]], the [[gill (volume)|gill]], the [[pint]], the [[quart]], the [[gallon]], the [[minim (unit)|minim]], the [[barrel (unit)|barrel]], the [[cord (unit)|cord]], the [[peck]], the [[bushel]], the [[hogshead]], the [[acre-foot]] and the [[board foot]].\n{{see also2|[[List of unusual units of measurement#Volume|unusual]]|[[List of obsolete units of measurement#Volume (dry and liquid)|obsolete units of volume]]}}\n\n== Related terms ==\n''Capacity'' is defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as \"the measure applied to the content of a vessel, and to liquids, grain, or the like, which take the shape of that which holds them\".<ref>{{OED|capacity}}</ref> (The word ''capacity'' has other unrelated meanings, as in e.g. [[capacity management]].) Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume, though closely related; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior. Units of capacity are the [[SI]] litre and its derived units, and Imperial units such as [[Gill (unit)|gill]], [[pint]], [[gallon]], and others. Units of volume are the cubes of [[units of length]].

A manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable. An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]]. Integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form.\n\nAn [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} \\, dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n ,</math>\n\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold, and <math>g</math> is the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold in terms of the same basis.\n\n== Volume in thermodynamics ==\n{{Main| Volume (thermodynamics)}}\n\nIn [[thermodynamics]], the '''volume''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is an important [[extensive parameter]] for describing its [[thermodynamic state]]. The '''specific volume''', an [[intensive property]], is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a [[function of state]] and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]].

The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i. e., the amount of [[fluid]] (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\n[[Three dimensional]] mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using [[arithmetic]] [[formula]]s<!--- both \"formulae\" and \"formulas\" are correct plurals of \"formula\" --->. Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with [[integral calculus]] if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. One-dimensional figures (such as [[line (mathematics)|lines]]) and [[two-dimensional]] shapes (such as [[square (geometry)|squares]]) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.\n\nThe volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by [[Displacement (fluid)|fluid displacement]].

The calculation for the volume of a cone of height ''h'', whose base is centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius ''r'', is as follows.\n\nThe radius of each circular disk is ''r'' if ''x'' = 0 and 0 if ''x'' = ''h'', and varying linearly in between\u2014that is,\n: <math>r \\frac{h - x}{h}.</math>\n\nThe surface area of the circular disk is then\n: <math> \\pi \\left(r\\frac{h - x}{h}\\right)^2 = \\pi r^2\\frac{(h - x)^2}{h^2}. </math>\n\nThe volume of the cone can then be calculated as\n: <math> \\int_0^h \\pi r^2\\frac{(h - x)^2}{h^2} dx, </math>\n\nand after extraction of the constants\n: <math>\\frac{\\pi r^2}{h^2} \\int_0^h (h - x)^2 dx</math>\n\nIntegrating gives us\n: <math>\\frac{\\pi r^2}{h^2}\\left(\\frac{h^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h.</math>\n\n==== Polyhedron ====\n{{main|Volume of a polyhedron}}\n\n== Volume in differential geometry ==\n{{main|Volume form}}\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a [[differential form]] of top degree (i.e., whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold) that is nowhere equal to zero.  A manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable. An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]]. Integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form.\n\nAn [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} \\, dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n ,</math>\n\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold, and <math>g</math> is the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold in terms of the same basis.\n\n== Volume in thermodynamics ==\n{{Main| Volume (thermodynamics)}}\n\nIn [[thermodynamics]], the '''volume''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is an important [[extensive parameter]] for describing its [[thermodynamic state]]. The '''specific volume''', an [[intensive property]], is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a [[function of state]] and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. For example, volume is related to the [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] of an [[ideal gas]] by the [[ideal gas law]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{cmn|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]]\n* [[Conversion of units#Volume|Conversion of units]]\n* [[Dimensional weight]]\n* [[Dimensioning]]\n* [[Length]]\n* [[Measure (mathematics)|Measure]]\n* [[Perimeter]]\n* [[Volume (thermodynamics)]]\n* [[Volumography]]\n* [[Weight]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Ccat}}\n* {{wikibooks-inline|Geometry|Chapter 8|Perimeters, Areas, Volumes}}\n* {{wikibooks-inline|Calculus|Volume}}\n\n[[Category:Volume|*]]\n", "name_user": "2a01:cb19:38e:5d00:9803:ce6b:f350:5307", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}

He became widely known as the \"Hero of Bennington\" for his exemplary service at the [[Battle of Bennington]] in 1777.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:John stark.jpg|left|thumb|200px|John Stark.]]\nJohn Stark was born in [[Londonderry, New Hampshire]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastnh.com/framers/stark.html|title=John Stark|work=seacoastnh.com|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> (at a site that is now in [[Derry, New Hampshire|Derry]]) in 1728.

Stark married [[Molly Stark|Elizabeth \"Molly\" Page]], with whom he had 11 children including his eldest son [[Caleb Stark]].\n\nOn April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the [[Baker River (New Hampshire)|Baker River]], a tributary of the [[Pemigewasset River]], he was captured by [[Abenaki]] warriors and brought back to [[Canada, New France|Canada]] but not before warning his brother [[William Stark (loyalist)|William]] to paddle away in his [[canoe]], though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to [[Running the gauntlet|run a gauntlet]] of warriors armed with sticks. Stark grabbed the stick from the first warrior's hands and proceeded to attack him, taking the rest of the warriors by surprise. The chief was so impressed by this heroic act that Stark was adopted into the tribe, where he spent the winter.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/memoirandoffici00stargoog Caleb Stark, John Stark, ''Memoir and Official Correspondence of Gen.

Robert Rogers, with an Account of His Services in America During the \"Seven Years' War.\"'' G.P. Lyon, 1860]</ref>\n\nThe following spring a government agent sent from the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] to work on the exchange of prisoners paid his ransom of $103 [[Spanish dollar]]s and $60 for Amos Eastman. Stark and Eastman then returned to New Hampshire safely.\n\n==French and Indian War==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}\nStark served as a [[second lieutenant]] under [[Major]] [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] during the [[French and Indian War]].  His brother [[William Stark (loyalist)|William Stark]] served beside him in Rogers' Rangers. As a member of the daring [[Rogers' Rangers]], Stark gained valuable combat experience and a detailed knowledge of the northern [[frontier]] of the American colonies.  While serving with the rangers in 1757, Stark went on a scouting mission toward [[Fort Ticonderoga|Fort Carillon]] in which the rangers [[Battle on Snowshoes (1757)|were ambushed]].\n\nGeneral [[Jeffery Amherst]], in 1759 ordered Rogers' Rangers to journey from [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George]] to the Abenaki village of [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]], deep in Quebec. The Rangers went north and attacked the Indian town. Stark, Rogers' second-in-command of all ranger companies, refused to accompany the attacking force out of respect for his Indian foster-parents residing there. He returned to New Hampshire to his wife, whom he had married the previous year.\n\nAt the end of the war, Stark retired as a [[captain (land)|captain]] and returned to Derryfield, New Hampshire.\n\n==American Revolution==\n[[File:GreenMtBoys.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Replica of the [[Green Mountain Boys]] flag in John Stark's collection.]]\n\n===Bunker Hill===\nThe [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775, signaled the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and Stark returned to military service.  On April 23, 1775, Stark accepted a [[Colonel (United States)|Colonelcy]] in the [[New Hampshire Militia]] and was given command of the [[1st New Hampshire Regiment]] and [[James Reed (soldier)|James Reed]] of the [[3rd New Hampshire Regiment]], also outside of Boston.  As soon as Stark could muster his men, he ferried and marched them south to [[Boston]] to support the blockaded rebels there. He made his headquarters in the confiscated [[Isaac Royall House]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]].\n\nOn June 16, the rebels, fearing a preemptive [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] attack on their positions in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], decided to take and hold Breed's Hill, a high point on the Charlestown peninsula near Boston.  On the night of the 16th, American troops moved into position on the heights and began digging entrenchments.\n\nAs dawn approached, lookouts on [[HMS Lively (1754)|HMS ''Lively'']], a 20-gun [[sloop of war]] noticed the activity and the sloop opened fire on the rebels and the works in progress.  This in turn drew the attention of the British admiral, who demanded to know what the ''Lively'' was shooting at.  Subsequent to that, the entire British squadron opened fire.  As dawn broke on June 17 the British could clearly see hastily constructed fortifications on Breed's Hill, and British Gen. [[Thomas Gage]] knew that he would have to drive the rebels out before fortifications were complete.  He ordered Major General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] to prepare to land his troops.  Thus began the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].  American Col. [[William Prescott]] held the hill throughout the intense initial bombardment with only a few hundred American militia.  Prescott knew that he was sorely outgunned and outnumbered.  He sent a desperate request for reinforcements.\n\nStark and Reed with the New Hampshire minutemen arrived at the scene soon after Prescott's request.  The ''Lively'' had begun a rain of accurate artillery fire directed at Charlestown Neck, the narrow strip of land connecting [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] to the rebel positions.  On the Charlestown side, several companies from other regiments were milling around in disarray, afraid to march into range of the artillery fire.  Stark ordered the men to stand aside and calmly marched his men to Prescott's positions without taking any casualties.\n\nWhen the New Hampshire militia arrived, the grateful Colonel Prescott allowed Stark to deploy his men where he saw fit.  Stark surveyed the ground and immediately saw that the British would probably try to flank the rebels by landing on the beach of the [[Mystic River]], below and to the left of Bunker Hill.  Stark led his men to the low ground between Mystic Beach and the hill and ordered them to \"fortify\" a two-rail fence by stuffing straw and grass between the rails.  Stark also noticed an additional gap in the defense line and ordered Lieutenant [[Nathaniel Hutchins]] from his brother William's company and others to follow him down a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} bank to the edge of the Mystic River. They piled rocks across the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} beach to form a crude defense line. After this fortification was hastily constructed, Stark deployed his men three-deep behind the wall.  A large contingent of British with the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] in the lead advanced towards the fortifications.  The Minutemen crouched and waited until the advancing British were almost on top of them, and then stood up and fired as one.  They unleashed a fierce and unexpected volley directly into the faces of the fusiliers, killing 90 in the blink of an eye and breaking their advance.  The fusiliers retreated in panic.  A charge of British infantry was next, climbing over their dead comrades to test Stark's line.  This charge too was decimated by a withering fusillade by the Minutemen.  A third charge was repulsed in a similar fashion, again with heavy losses to the British.  The British officers wisely withdrew their men from that landing point and decided to land elsewhere, with the support of artillery.\n\nLater in the battle, as the rebels were forced from the hill, Stark directed the New Hampshire regiment's fire to provide cover for Colonel Prescott's retreating troops. The day's New Hampshire dead were later buried in the [[Salem Street Burying Ground]], [[Medford, Massachusetts]].\n\nWhile the British did eventually take the hill that day, their losses were formidable, especially among the officers.  After the arrival of General [[George Washington]]  two weeks after the battle, the siege reached a stalemate until March the next year, when cannon seized at the [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] were positioned on [[Dorchester Heights]] in a deft night manoeuvre.  This placement threatened the British fleet in Boston Harbor and forced General Howe to withdraw all his forces from the Boston garrison and sail for [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nAmong the notable men who served under Stark was Captain [[Henry Dearborn]], who later became Secretary of War under President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Dearborn arrived with 60 militia men from New Hampshire.<ref>Dearborn, Henry; Peckham, Howard (ed.). ''Revolutionary War Journals of Henry Dearborn, 1775\u20131783''. 2009. p. 5</ref>\n\n===Trenton and Princeton===\n[[File:Starksgravesite.JPG|thumb|Statue at Stark Park in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] ]]\nAs Washington prepared to go to New York in anticipation of a British attack there, he knew that he desperately needed experienced men like John Stark to command regiments in the [[Continental Army]]. George Washington immediately offered Stark a command in the Continental Army. Stark and his New Hampshire regiment agreed to attach themselves to the Continental Army. The men of the [[New Hampshire Line]] were sent as reinforcements to the Continental Army during the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Invasion of Canada]] in the spring of 1776. After the retreat of the Continental Army from Canada, Stark and his men traveled to New Jersey to join Washington's main army.  They were with Washington in the battles of [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] and [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] in late 1776 and early 1777.\n\nAfter Trenton, Washington asked Stark to return to New Hampshire to recruit more men for the Continental Army. Stark agreed, but upon returning home, learned that while he had been fighting in New Jersey, a fellow New Hampshire Colonel named [[Enoch Poor]] had been promoted to Brigadier General in the Continental Army. In Stark's opinion, Poor had refused to march his militia regiment to Bunker Hill to join the battle, instead choosing to keep his regiment at home. Stark, an experienced woodsman and fighting commander, had been passed over for someone with no combat experience and apparently no will to fight. On March 23, 1777, Stark resigned his commission in disgust, although he pledged his future aid to New Hampshire if it should be needed.\n\n===Bennington and beyond===\n[[File:John Stark Bennington Vermont Statue.JPG|thumb|left|General Stark's statue at the [[Bennington Battle Monument]]]]\nFour months later, his home state offered Stark a commission as [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of the [[New Hampshire Militia]].  He accepted on the strict condition that he would not be answerable to Continental Army authority.  Soon after receiving his commission, Stark assembled 1,492 militiamen in civilian clothes with personal firearms. He traveled to [[Manchester, Vermont]]. At this place, he was ordered by Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] (of the Continental Army) to reinforce [[Philip Schuyler]]'s Continental army on the [[Hudson River]].  Stark refused to obey Lincoln, who was another general whom he believed was unfairly promoted over his head. Lincoln was diplomatic enough to allow him to operate independently against the rear of General [[John Burgoyne]]'s British army.<ref>Boatner, 69</ref>\n\nBurgoyne sent an expedition under Lieutenant Colonel [[Friedrich Baum]] to capture American supplies at [[Bennington, Vermont]]. Baum commanded 374 [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick]] infantry and dismounted dragoons, 300 Indians, loyalists, and Canadians, and two 3-pound cannons manned by 30 Hessians.<ref>Boatner, 68</ref> Stark heard about the raid and marched his force to Bennington. Meanwhile, Baum received intelligence that Bennington was held by 1,800 men. On August 14, Baum asked Burgoyne for reinforcements but assured his army commander that his opponents would not give him much trouble.<ref>Boatner, 70</ref> The Brunswick officer then fortified his position and waited for Lieutenant Colonel [[Heinrich von Breymann]]'s 642 soldiers and two 6-pound cannons to reach him. Colonel [[Seth Warner]] also set out with his 350 men to reinforce Stark.<ref>Boatner, 72</ref>\n\nAfter waiting out a day of rain, at 3:00 PM on the 16th Stark sent 200 militia to the right, 300 men to the left, 200 troops against a position held by Tories, and 100 men on a feint against Baum's main redoubt. In the face of these attacks, the Indians, loyalists, and Canadians fled, leaving Baum stranded in his main position. As his envelopment took effect, Stark led his remaining 1,200 troops against Baum, saying, \"We'll beat them before night or Molly Stark's a widow.\" After an ammunition wagon exploded, Baum's men tried to hack their way out of the trap with their dragoon sabers. Baum was fatally hit and his men gave up around 5:00 PM.<ref>Boatner, 73</ref> With Stark's men somewhat scattered by their victory, Breymann's column appeared on the scene. At this moment Colonel [[Seth Warner]]'s 350 [[Green Mountain Boys]] arrived to confront Breymann's men. Between Stark and Warner, the Germans were stopped and then forced to withdraw. The New Hampshire and Vermont soldiers severely mauled Breymann's command but the German officer managed to get away with about two-thirds of his force.<ref>Boatner, 74</ref> Historian Mark M. Boatner wrote,\n\n<blockquote>As a commander of New England militia Stark had one rare and priceless quality: he knew the ''limitations'' of his men. They were innocent of military training, undisciplined, and unenthusiastic about getting shot. With these men he killed over 200 of Europe's vaunted regulars with a loss of 14 Americans killed.<ref>Boatner, 75\u201376</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother version has Stark rallying his troops with the cry, \"There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow!\"\n\nStark's action contributed to the surrender of Burgoyne's northern army after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] by raising American morale, by keeping the British from getting supplies, and by subtracting several hundred men from the enemy order of battle. Stark reported 14 killed and 42 wounded. Of Baum's 374 professional soldiers, only nine men escaped. For this feat Stark won his coveted promotion to [[brigadier general]] in the [[Continental Army]] on October 4, 1777.<ref>Boatner, 76. Boatner also listed 700 captured.</ref>\n\nSaratoga is seen as the turning point in the Revolutionary War, as it was the first major defeat of a British general and it convinced the [[France|French]] that the Americans were worthy of military aid. After the [[Battle of Freeman's Farm]] Gen. Stark's brigade moved into a position at [[Stark's Knob]] cutting off Burgoyne's retreat to [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Champlain]].\n\nJohn Stark sat as a judge in the [[court martial]] that in September 1780 found British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] guilty of spying and in helping in the conspiracy of [[Benedict Arnold]] to surrender [[West Point]] to the British.\n\nHe was the commander of the [[Northern theatre of the American Revolutionary War|Northern Department]] three times between 1778 and 1781 along with commanding a brigade at the [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Battle of Springfield]] in June of 1780.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Starkgravesite.JPG|left|thumb|Gravesite in [[Stark Park]], [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]]]\n\nAfter serving with distinction throughout the rest of the war, Stark retired to his farm in Derryfield, renamed Manchester in 1810, where he died on May 8, 1822 at the age of 93.  \n\nIt has been said{{by whom|date=May 2014}} that of all the Revolutionary War generals, Stark was the only true [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]] because he truly retired from public life at the end of the war.  In 1809, a group of Bennington veterans gathered to commemorate the battle.  General Stark, then aged 81, was not well enough to travel, but he sent a letter to his comrades, which closed \"Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.\"  The motto ''[[Live Free or Die]]'' became the New Hampshire state motto in 1945. Stark and the Battle of Bennington were later commemorated with the {{Convert|306|ft|m|sing=on}} tall [[Bennington Battle Monument]] and a statue of Stark in [[Bennington, Vermont]].\n\n==Historic sites==\nThere is a [[New Hampshire historical marker]] ([[List of New Hampshire historical markers (26\u201350)#48|number 48]]) near John Stark's birthplace on the east side of [[New Hampshire Route 28]] (Rockingham Road) in [[Derry, New Hampshire]], just south of the intersection of Lawrence Road.<ref name=ByNumber>{{cite web |url=https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/markers/documents/markers_bynumber.pdf |title=List of Markers by Marker Number |website=nh.gov |publisher=New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref> There is a second stone marker at the actual homestead location.\n\n[[Gen.

The property, which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is open by appointment only.  Manchester's [[Stark Park]], also a listed property, is home to his grave and is named in his honor. There is a bronze statue of General Stark in front of the [[New Hampshire Statehouse]] in Concord; it was dedicated in 1890. New Castle's [[Fort Stark]] was re-named for the General in 1900. It was one of seven forts built in the area to protect the nearby city of Portsmouth.

He became widely known as the \"Hero of Bennington\" for his exemplary service at the [[Battle of Bennington]] in 1777.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:John stark.jpg|left|thumb|200px|John Stark.]]\nJohn Stark was born in [[Londonderry, New Hampshire]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastnh.com/framers/stark.html|title=John Stark|work=seacoastnh.com|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> (at a site that is now in [[Derry, New Hampshire|Derry]]) in 1728. His father was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], to parents who were from [[Wiltshire]], [[England]];<ref>Landmarks of the American Revolution: a guide to locating and knowing what happened at the sites of independence by Mark Mayo Boatner - Hawthorn Books, 1975 page 158-159</ref> Stark's father met his future wife when he moved to [[Derry|Londonderry]] in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>Ferling p. 36</ref> When Stark was eight years old, his family moved to Derryfield (now [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]), where he lived for the rest of his life. Stark married [[Molly Stark|Elizabeth \"Molly\" Page]], with whom he had 11 children including his eldest son [[Caleb Stark]].\n\nOn April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the [[Baker River (New Hampshire)|Baker River]], a tributary of the [[Pemigewasset River]], he was captured by [[Abenaki]] warriors and brought back to [[Canada, New France|Canada]] but not before warning his brother [[William Stark (loyalist)|William]] to paddle away in his [[canoe]], though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to [[Running the gauntlet|run a gauntlet]] of warriors armed with sticks. Stark grabbed the stick from the first warrior's hands and proceeded to attack him, taking the rest of the warriors by surprise. The chief was so impressed by this heroic act that Stark was adopted into the tribe, where he spent the winter.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/memoirandoffici00stargoog Caleb Stark, John Stark, ''Memoir and Official Correspondence of Gen.

Robert Rogers, with an Account of His Services in America During the \"Seven Years' War.\"'' G.P. Lyon, 1860]</ref>\n\nThe following spring a government agent sent from the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] to work on the exchange of prisoners paid his ransom of $103 [[Spanish dollar]]s and $60 for Amos Eastman. Stark and Eastman then returned to New Hampshire safely.\n\n==French and Indian War==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}\nStark served as a [[second lieutenant]] under [[Major]] [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] during the [[French and Indian War]].  His brother [[William Stark (loyalist)|William Stark]] served beside him in Rogers' Rangers. As a member of the daring [[Rogers' Rangers]], Stark gained valuable combat experience and a detailed knowledge of the northern [[frontier]] of the American colonies.  While serving with the rangers in 1757, Stark went on a scouting mission toward [[Fort Ticonderoga|Fort Carillon]] in which the rangers [[Battle on Snowshoes (1757)|were ambushed]].\n\nGeneral [[Jeffery Amherst]], in 1759 ordered Rogers' Rangers to journey from [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George]] to the Abenaki village of [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]], deep in Quebec. The Rangers went north and attacked the Indian town. Stark, Rogers' second-in-command of all ranger companies, refused to accompany the attacking force out of respect for his Indian foster-parents residing there. He returned to New Hampshire to his wife, whom he had married the previous year.\n\nAt the end of the war, Stark retired as a [[captain (land)|captain]] and returned to Derryfield, New Hampshire.\n\n==American Revolution==\n[[File:GreenMtBoys.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Replica of the [[Green Mountain Boys]] flag in John Stark's collection.]]\n\n===Bunker Hill===\nThe [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775, signaled the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and Stark returned to military service.  On April 23, 1775, Stark accepted a [[Colonel (United States)|Colonelcy]] in the [[New Hampshire Militia]] and was given command of the [[1st New Hampshire Regiment]] and [[James Reed (soldier)|James Reed]] of the [[3rd New Hampshire Regiment]], also outside of Boston.  As soon as Stark could muster his men, he ferried and marched them south to [[Boston]] to support the blockaded rebels there. He made his headquarters in the confiscated [[Isaac Royall House]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]].\n\nOn June 16, the rebels, fearing a preemptive [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] attack on their positions in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], decided to take and hold Breed's Hill, a high point on the Charlestown peninsula near Boston.  On the night of the 16th, American troops moved into position on the heights and began digging entrenchments.\n\nAs dawn approached, lookouts on [[HMS Lively (1754)|HMS ''Lively'']], a 20-gun [[sloop of war]] noticed the activity and the sloop opened fire on the rebels and the works in progress.  This in turn drew the attention of the British admiral, who demanded to know what the ''Lively'' was shooting at.  Subsequent to that, the entire British squadron opened fire.  As dawn broke on June 17 the British could clearly see hastily constructed fortifications on Breed's Hill, and British Gen. [[Thomas Gage]] knew that he would have to drive the rebels out before fortifications were complete.  He ordered Major General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] to prepare to land his troops.  Thus began the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].  American Col. [[William Prescott]] held the hill throughout the intense initial bombardment with only a few hundred American militia.  Prescott knew that he was sorely outgunned and outnumbered.  He sent a desperate request for reinforcements.\n\nStark and Reed with the New Hampshire minutemen arrived at the scene soon after Prescott's request.  The ''Lively'' had begun a rain of accurate artillery fire directed at Charlestown Neck, the narrow strip of land connecting [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] to the rebel positions.  On the Charlestown side, several companies from other regiments were milling around in disarray, afraid to march into range of the artillery fire.  Stark ordered the men to stand aside and calmly marched his men to Prescott's positions without taking any casualties.\n\nWhen the New Hampshire militia arrived, the grateful Colonel Prescott allowed Stark to deploy his men where he saw fit.  Stark surveyed the ground and immediately saw that the British would probably try to flank the rebels by landing on the beach of the [[Mystic River]], below and to the left of Bunker Hill.  Stark led his men to the low ground between Mystic Beach and the hill and ordered them to \"fortify\" a two-rail fence by stuffing straw and grass between the rails.  Stark also noticed an additional gap in the defense line and ordered Lieutenant [[Nathaniel Hutchins]] from his brother William's company and others to follow him down a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} bank to the edge of the Mystic River. They piled rocks across the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} beach to form a crude defense line. After this fortification was hastily constructed, Stark deployed his men three-deep behind the wall.  A large contingent of British with the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] in the lead advanced towards the fortifications.  The Minutemen crouched and waited until the advancing British were almost on top of them, and then stood up and fired as one.  They unleashed a fierce and unexpected volley directly into the faces of the fusiliers, killing 90 in the blink of an eye and breaking their advance.  The fusiliers retreated in panic.  A charge of British infantry was next, climbing over their dead comrades to test Stark's line.  This charge too was decimated by a withering fusillade by the Minutemen.  A third charge was repulsed in a similar fashion, again with heavy losses to the British.  The British officers wisely withdrew their men from that landing point and decided to land elsewhere, with the support of artillery.\n\nLater in the battle, as the rebels were forced from the hill, Stark directed the New Hampshire regiment's fire to provide cover for Colonel Prescott's retreating troops. The day's New Hampshire dead were later buried in the [[Salem Street Burying Ground]], [[Medford, Massachusetts]].\n\nWhile the British did eventually take the hill that day, their losses were formidable, especially among the officers.  After the arrival of General [[George Washington]]  two weeks after the battle, the siege reached a stalemate until March the next year, when cannon seized at the [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] were positioned on [[Dorchester Heights]] in a deft night manoeuvre.  This placement threatened the British fleet in Boston Harbor and forced General Howe to withdraw all his forces from the Boston garrison and sail for [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nAmong the notable men who served under Stark was Captain [[Henry Dearborn]], who later became Secretary of War under President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Dearborn arrived with 60 militia men from New Hampshire.<ref>Dearborn, Henry; Peckham, Howard (ed.). ''Revolutionary War Journals of Henry Dearborn, 1775\u20131783''. 2009. p. 5</ref>\n\n===Trenton and Princeton===\n[[File:Starksgravesite.JPG|thumb|Statue at Stark Park in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] ]]\nAs Washington prepared to go to New York in anticipation of a British attack there, he knew that he desperately needed experienced men like John Stark to command regiments in the [[Continental Army]]. George Washington immediately offered Stark a command in the Continental Army. Stark and his New Hampshire regiment agreed to attach themselves to the Continental Army. The men of the [[New Hampshire Line]] were sent as reinforcements to the Continental Army during the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Invasion of Canada]] in the spring of 1776. After the retreat of the Continental Army from Canada, Stark and his men traveled to New Jersey to join Washington's main army.  They were with Washington in the battles of [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] and [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] in late 1776 and early 1777.\n\nAfter Trenton, Washington asked Stark to return to New Hampshire to recruit more men for the Continental Army. Stark agreed, but upon returning home, learned that while he had been fighting in New Jersey, a fellow New Hampshire Colonel named [[Enoch Poor]] had been promoted to Brigadier General in the Continental Army. In Stark's opinion, Poor had refused to march his militia regiment to Bunker Hill to join the battle, instead choosing to keep his regiment at home. Stark, an experienced woodsman and fighting commander, had been passed over for someone with no combat experience and apparently no will to fight. On March 23, 1777, Stark resigned his commission in disgust, although he pledged his future aid to New Hampshire if it should be needed.\n\n===Bennington and beyond===\n[[File:John Stark Bennington Vermont Statue.JPG|thumb|left|General Stark's statue at the [[Bennington Battle Monument]]]]\nFour months later, his home state offered Stark a commission as [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of the [[New Hampshire Militia]].  He accepted on the strict condition that he would not be answerable to Continental Army authority.  Soon after receiving his commission, Stark assembled 1,492 militiamen in civilian clothes with personal firearms. He traveled to [[Manchester, Vermont]]. At this place, he was ordered by Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] (of the Continental Army) to reinforce [[Philip Schuyler]]'s Continental army on the [[Hudson River]].  Stark refused to obey Lincoln, who was another general whom he believed was unfairly promoted over his head. Lincoln was diplomatic enough to allow him to operate independently against the rear of General [[John Burgoyne]]'s British army.<ref>Boatner, 69</ref>\n\nBurgoyne sent an expedition under Lieutenant Colonel [[Friedrich Baum]] to capture American supplies at [[Bennington, Vermont]]. Baum commanded 374 [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick]] infantry and dismounted dragoons, 300 Indians, loyalists, and Canadians, and two 3-pound cannons manned by 30 Hessians.<ref>Boatner, 68</ref> Stark heard about the raid and marched his force to Bennington. Meanwhile, Baum received intelligence that Bennington was held by 1,800 men. On August 14, Baum asked Burgoyne for reinforcements but assured his army commander that his opponents would not give him much trouble.<ref>Boatner, 70</ref> The Brunswick officer then fortified his position and waited for Lieutenant Colonel [[Heinrich von Breymann]]'s 642 soldiers and two 6-pound cannons to reach him. Colonel [[Seth Warner]] also set out with his 350 men to reinforce Stark.<ref>Boatner, 72</ref>\n\nAfter waiting out a day of rain, at 3:00 PM on the 16th Stark sent 200 militia to the right, 300 men to the left, 200 troops against a position held by Tories, and 100 men on a feint against Baum's main redoubt. In the face of these attacks, the Indians, loyalists, and Canadians fled, leaving Baum stranded in his main position. As his envelopment took effect, Stark led his remaining 1,200 troops against Baum, saying, \"We'll beat them before night or Molly Stark's a widow.\" After an ammunition wagon exploded, Baum's men tried to hack their way out of the trap with their dragoon sabers. Baum was fatally hit and his men gave up around 5:00 PM.<ref>Boatner, 73</ref> With Stark's men somewhat scattered by their victory, Breymann's column appeared on the scene. At this moment Colonel [[Seth Warner]]'s 350 [[Green Mountain Boys]] arrived to confront Breymann's men. Between Stark and Warner, the Germans were stopped and then forced to withdraw. The New Hampshire and Vermont soldiers severely mauled Breymann's command but the German officer managed to get away with about two-thirds of his force.<ref>Boatner, 74</ref> Historian Mark M. Boatner wrote,\n\n<blockquote>As a commander of New England militia Stark had one rare and priceless quality: he knew the ''limitations'' of his men. They were innocent of military training, undisciplined, and unenthusiastic about getting shot. With these men he killed over 200 of Europe's vaunted regulars with a loss of 14 Americans killed.<ref>Boatner, 75\u201376</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother version has Stark rallying his troops with the cry, \"There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow!\"\n\nStark's action contributed to the surrender of Burgoyne's northern army after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] by raising American morale, by keeping the British from getting supplies, and by subtracting several hundred men from the enemy order of battle. Stark reported 14 killed and 42 wounded. Of Baum's 374 professional soldiers, only nine men escaped. For this feat Stark won his coveted promotion to [[brigadier general]] in the [[Continental Army]] on October 4, 1777.<ref>Boatner, 76. Boatner also listed 700 captured.</ref>\n\nSaratoga is seen as the turning point in the Revolutionary War, as it was the first major defeat of a British general and it convinced the [[France|French]] that the Americans were worthy of military aid. After the [[Battle of Freeman's Farm]] Gen. Stark's brigade moved into a position at [[Stark's Knob]] cutting off Burgoyne's retreat to [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Champlain]].\n\nJohn Stark sat as a judge in the [[court martial]] that in September 1780 found British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] guilty of spying and in helping in the conspiracy of [[Benedict Arnold]] to surrender [[West Point]] to the British.\n\nHe was the commander of the [[Northern theatre of the American Revolutionary War|Northern Department]] three times between 1778 and 1781 along with commanding a brigade at the [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Battle of Springfield]] in June of 1780.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Starkgravesite.JPG|left|thumb|Gravesite in [[Stark Park]], [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]]]\n\nAfter serving with distinction throughout the rest of the war, Stark retired to his farm in Derryfield, renamed Manchester in 1810, where he died on May 8, 1822 at the age of 93.  \n\nIt has been said{{by whom|date=May 2014}} that of all the Revolutionary War generals, Stark was the only true [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]] because he truly retired from public life at the end of the war.  In 1809, a group of Bennington veterans gathered to commemorate the battle.  General Stark, then aged 81, was not well enough to travel, but he sent a letter to his comrades, which closed \"Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.\"  The motto ''[[Live Free or Die]]'' became the New Hampshire state motto in 1945. Stark and the Battle of Bennington were later commemorated with the {{Convert|306|ft|m|sing=on}} tall [[Bennington Battle Monument]] and a statue of Stark in [[Bennington, Vermont]].\n\n==Historic sites==\nThere is a [[New Hampshire historical marker]] ([[List of New Hampshire historical markers (26\u201350)#48|number 48]]) near John Stark's birthplace on the east side of [[New Hampshire Route 28]] (Rockingham Road) in [[Derry, New Hampshire]], just south of the intersection of Lawrence Road.<ref name=ByNumber>{{cite web |url=https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/markers/documents/markers_bynumber.pdf |title=List of Markers by Marker Number |website=nh.gov |publisher=New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref> There is a second stone marker at the actual homestead location.\n\n[[Gen. John Stark House|Stark's childhood home]] is located at 2000 Elm Street in Manchester, New Hampshire.  The home was built in 1736 by John's father Archibald. The building is now owned by the Molly Stark Chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. The property, which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is open by appointment only.  Manchester's [[Stark Park]], also a listed property, is home to his grave and is named in his honor. There is a bronze statue of General Stark in front of the [[New Hampshire Statehouse]] in Concord; it was dedicated in 1890. New Castle's [[Fort Stark]] was re-named for the General in 1900. It was one of seven forts built in the area to protect the nearby city of Portsmouth. The historic site is placed on a peninsula known as Jerry\u2019s point (or Jaffrey\u2019s Point) on the southeast side of the island.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abandonedspaces.com/conflict/fort-stark.html|title=Fort Stark in New Castle in active use from 1746 until WWII - Abandoned Spaces|date=2018-03-27|work=Abandoned Spaces|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Isaac Royall House]], Stark's headquarters in [[Medford, Massachusetts]]\n* [[John Stark (Conrads)|''John Stark'' (Conrads)]]\n* [[Fort at Number 4]]\n\nMany places in the United States were named after John Stark and his wife Molly.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-television]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television series==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Last aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

The series premiered on March 18, 2013 and produced five seasons for a total of 50 episodes. The series was shot in [[Vancouver]] with a replica of the Psycho house from [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and a recreation of the original Bates Motel from the first movie.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O. Philippe]] running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Karyn Kusama]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Oz Perkins]], [[Leigh Whannell]], [[Walter Murch]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Richard Stanley (director)|Richard Stanley]] and [[Neil Marshall]].<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-television]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television series==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Last aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence.

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O.

The songs were written in the U.S., reflecting Marling's experience of living in Los Angeles. However, after recording a new album, she felt unsatisfied with the result, and made the decision to scrap most of the songs written in that period. During this time, she became involved in activities unrelated to music. When production later resumed, she completed the album with her band at Urchin Studios in London.

Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with [[Sign language#Non-manual elements|non-manual elements]]. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sign languages are not universal and they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with each other,<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Sign Language?|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|accessdate=10 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195125/https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|archivedate=13 February 2018}}</ref> although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.\n\nLinguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of [[natural language]], meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning. Sign language should not be confused with [[body language]], a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].\n\nWherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed as handy means of communication and they form the core of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as [[Child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]].\n\nIt is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists 137 sign languages.<ref>{{citation\n |contribution  = Deaf sign language\n |title         = Ethnologue: Languages of the World\n |year          = 2013\n |edition       = 17th\n |publisher     = SIL International\n |accessdate    = 2013-12-03\n |editor1-last  = Lewis\n |editor1-first = M.

One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: \"If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?\"<ref name=\"bauman2008\">{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=978-0-8166-4619-7}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] (1520\u20131584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[Juan Pablo Bonet]] published {{lang|es|Reducci\u00f3n de las letras y arte para ense\u00f1ar a hablar a los mudos}} (\u2018Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak\u2019) in Madrid.<ref>Pablo Bonet, J. de (1620) ''Reduction de las letras y Arte para ense\u00f1ar \u00e1 ablar los Mudos''.

''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of \"secret discoursing, by signes and gestures\".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: \"Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z.\" (1641:116-117)</ref> public speaking, or communication by deaf people.<ref>John Bulwer's \"Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.\", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.</ref> In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described \"Master Babington\", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, \"contryved on the joynts of his fingers\", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].<ref>Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.</ref>\n\nIn 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',<ref>Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.</ref> in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an \"arthrological\" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;<ref>See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.</ref> some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 }}</ref><ref>Montgomery, G. \"The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes\" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.</ref>\n\nThe [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.<ref>Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. \"Historical Aspects of Manual Communication\" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.<br />\nand Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)</ref>  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.\n\n[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.<ref>Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}</ref> He described such codes for both English and Latin.\n\nBy 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.<ref>Daniel Defoe (1720). \"The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell\"</ref> Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.\n\nFrenchman [[Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e|Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.<ref>Canlas (2006).</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College.

The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language.

While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.<ref>Johnston (1989).</ref> The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.<ref>Taub (2001).</ref> This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.\n\nSign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s, from the Greek word for \"hand\", in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s, from Greek for \"voice\", of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although crude distinctions are often also made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].<ref>Fabian Bross (2016).

More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions \"function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information\".<ref>Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research.

Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.{{Which|date=June 2019}}\n\nToday, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category \"sign languages\" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,<ref>p. 970-972.

Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as \"inventors\" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.\n\nAs a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.\n\nOn the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.<ref>Nakamura (1995).</ref>\n\nSimilarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.\n\n=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===\n[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|\"Hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\n[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of \"hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\nSign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.\n\nOne way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[Classifier constructions in sign languages|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.\n\nThe large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry<ref>Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.</ref> or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).\n\n=== Non-manual elements ===\nSign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.\n\nAt the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.<ref>Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |editor1=Josep Quer i Carbonell |editor2=Carlo Cecchetto |editor3=Rannveig Sverrisd \u00c3ttir |year=2017 |isbn=9781501511806 |oclc=1012688117}}</ref>\n\nWhile the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).<ref>Fabian Bross & Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}.

Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.<ref>Baker, Charlotte (1977).

New York: Academic Press</ref>\n\n=== Iconicity ===\n[[Iconicity]] is similarity or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to [[Arbitrariness#Linguistics|arbitrariness]]. The first studies on iconicity in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.<ref>Frishberg (1975)</ref><ref>Klima & Bellugi (1979)</ref> Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, when deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.<ref>Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. \"The Signs of Language.\" Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.</ref> Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.<ref>Brentari, Diane. \"Introduction.\" Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.</ref> Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.\n\nIn 1978, Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to suggest that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.<ref>Brown, R. (1978). ''Why Are Signed Languages Easier to Learn than Spoken Languages? Part Two. Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 32(3), 25.''{{doi|10.2307/3823113}}</ref>  In his study, Brown found that when a group of six hearing children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than another group of six children that were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties. In contrast to Brown, linguists [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]] and Richard Meier found that iconicity \"appears to have virtually no impact on the acquisition of American Sign Language\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The crosslinguistic study of language acquisition|last=Newport|first=Elissa|last2=Meier|first2=Richard|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1985|isbn=0898593670|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881 881\u2013938]|url=https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881}}</ref>\n\nA central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or \"English on the hands.\" One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.\n\nThe [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.<ref name=\"Taub 2001\">Taub (2001)</ref> In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation (\"[[construal]]\" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.<ref>Wilcox (2004)</ref>\n\nThe cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.<ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\">Wilcox (2000)</ref> In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for \"ask\" has parts of its form that are iconic (\"movement away from the mouth\" means \"something coming from the mouth\"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).<ref name=\"Meir 2010\">Meir (2010)</ref>\n\nMany signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is \"learning\". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as \"double mapped\".<ref name=\"Taub 2001\"/><ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\"/><ref name=\"Meir 2010\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Classification ===\n{{See also|List of sign languages}}\n[[File:Sign language families.svg|thumb|300px|Sign language families I|\n|'''The classification of Sign Language families'''\n{{Legend|#5d6a8f|[[French Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#1e2f5d|[[American Sign Language]] (ASL) cluster}}\n{{Legend|#93a1c7|[[Russian Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#a8d3db|[[Czech Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#9c6cd0|[[Danish Sign Language]] family}}\n{{Legend|#a596d8|[[Swedish Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#b08660|[[German Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#660066|[[Vietnamese sign languages]] & some Thai and Lao SLs}}\n{{Legend|#383834|[[Arab sign-language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#99ff00|[[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#ff9691|[[Chinese Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#bd4b31|[[Japanese Sign Language family]] (including Taiwanese Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#4b874b|[[BANZSL]] family (British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#1c5e31|[[South African Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#fff200|Isolated languages}}\n{{Legend|#e6e6e6|No data}}]]\nAlthough sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.\n\nSign languages may be classified by how they arise.\n\nIn non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.\n\nA [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |editor1-last= Marschark |editor1-first= Marc |editor2-last= Spencer |editor2-first= Patricia Elizabeth |title= Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0mmJAgAAQBAJ |volume= 2 |location= New York |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-539003-2 |oclc= 779907637 |access-date= 2016-11-05 }}</ref> The most famous of these is probably the extinct [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] of the US, but there are also numerous village languages scattered throughout Africa, Asia, and America.\n\n[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.\n\nBoth contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.\n\n[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&nbsp;\u2013 it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the \"gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa\", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.<ref>Frishberg (1987).

There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.\n** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].\n* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.\n* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.\n* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a \"cluster\" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.\n* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].\n* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].\n\nThe only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.<ref>Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.</ref> The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.{{refn |Wittmann's classification went into Ethnologue's database where it is still cited.<ref>{{cite web |editor1=Simons, Gary F. |editor2=Charles D.

He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Typology ===\n{{See also|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.\n\nSign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.\n\nSign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.\n\nBrentari<ref name=\"Brentari1998\">Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref><ref>Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35\u201336; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref> classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).\n\nAnother aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zeshan | first1 = Ulrike | last2 = Ernesto Escobedo Delgado | first2 = Cesar | last3 = Dikyuva | first3 = Hasan | last4 = Panda | first4 = Sibaji | last5 = de Vos | first5 = Connie | year = 2013 | title = Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology | url = | journal = Linguistic Typology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 357\u2013396 }}</ref> Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.\n\n=== Acquisition ===\n{{See also|Language acquisition}}\n\nChildren who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}</ref>\n\nThe Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the [[brain plasticity|plasticity]] of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|website=ACFOS|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don't have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262\u2013290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}</ref>\n\n=== Written forms ===\n{{anchor|Notation}}<!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here -->\nSign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form.

Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press</ref> is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.\n* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.\n* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].\n* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.\n* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.\n* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).\n*The Alphabetic Writing System for sign languages (''Sistema de escritura alfab\u00e9tica'', SEA, by its Spanish name and acronym), developed by linguist \u00c1ngel Herrero Blanco and two deaf researchers, Juan Jos\u00e9 Alfaro and Inmacualada Cascales, was published as a book in 2003<ref>{{Cite book|title=Escritura alfab\u00e9tica de la Lengua de Signos Espa\u00f1ola : once lecciones|last=Herrero Blanco, \u00c1ngel L.|date=2003|publisher=Publicaciones de la Universidad de Alicante|others=Alfaro, Juan Jos\u00e9,, Cascales, Inmaculada|isbn=9781282574960|location=San Vicente del Raspeig [Alicante]|oclc=643124997}}</ref> and made accessible in [[Spanish Sign Language]] on-line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/seccion/signos/psegundonivel.jsp?seccion=signos&conten=materiales&pagina=cat_materiales1&tit3=Lecciones+de+escritura+alfab%25E9tica+de+LSE|title=Biblioteca de signos - Materiales|website=www.cervantesvirtual.com|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> This system makes use of the letters of the Latin alphabet with a few diacritics to represent sign through the morphemic sequence S L C Q D F (bimanual sign, place, contact, handshape, direction and internal form). The resulting words are meant to be read by signing. The system is designed to be applicable to any sign language with minimal modification and to be usable through any medium without special equipment or software. Non-manual elements can be encoded to some extent, but the authors argue that the system does not need to represent all elements of a sign to be practical, the same way written oral language doesn't.

It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.\nIn the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSigns may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.\n\n=== Legal recognition ===\n{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}\nSome sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.\n\nThe interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.\n\nWith recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent deep learning based [[machine translation of sign languages|machine translation algorithms]] have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Huang |first=Jie |last2=Zhou |first2=Wengang |last3=Zhang |first3=Qilin |last4=Li |first4=Houqiang |last5=Li |first5=Weiping |title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation |conference=32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), Feb. 2-7, 2018, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA |date=2018-01-30 |url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-29 |arxiv=1801.10111 }}</ref> \n{{clear}}\n\n=== Remote interpreting ===\n<!-- Note: the following text was originally copied from [[Language interpretation#Video interpreting|Language interpretation]]\nbut has been adapted extensively to fit into the context of this article.\n -->\n[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|upright|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]\n{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}\n\nInterpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.\n\nHowever, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Interpretation on television ===\n[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]\n\nSign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.\n\n[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.<ref>{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | accessdate=2008-01-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.<ref name=\"RNID\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 }}</ref>  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed.

Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.\n\n=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===\n{{Main|Manually coded language}}\n\nWhen Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.\n\n=== \"Baby sign language\" with hearing children ===\n{{Main|Baby sign language}}\n\nSome hearing parents teach signs to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs are seen as a beneficial option for better communication.<ref>Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.</ref> Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.{{cn|date=February 2020}} This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants. When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThis is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.\n\n=== Home sign ===\n{{Main|Home sign}}\n\nInformal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes \"kitchen sign\").<ref>Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow & Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].</ref>\n\nHome sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.<ref>The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard.

Sign language should not be confused with [[body language]], a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].\n\nWherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed as handy means of communication and they form the core of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as [[Child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]].\n\nIt is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists 137 sign languages.<ref>{{citation\n |contribution  = Deaf sign language\n |title         = Ethnologue: Languages of the World\n |year          = 2013\n |edition       = 17th\n |publisher     = SIL International\n |accessdate    = 2013-12-03\n |editor1-last  = Lewis\n |editor1-first = M.

One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: \"If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?\"<ref name=\"bauman2008\">{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=978-0-8166-4619-7}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] (1520\u20131584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[Juan Pablo Bonet]] published {{lang|es|Reducci\u00f3n de las letras y arte para ense\u00f1ar a hablar a los mudos}} (\u2018Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak\u2019) in Madrid.<ref>Pablo Bonet, J. de (1620) ''Reduction de las letras y Arte para ense\u00f1ar \u00e1 ablar los Mudos''.

''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of \"secret discoursing, by signes and gestures\".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: \"Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z.\" (1641:116-117)</ref> public speaking, or communication by deaf people.<ref>John Bulwer's \"Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.\", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.</ref> In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described \"Master Babington\", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, \"contryved on the joynts of his fingers\", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].<ref>Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.</ref>\n\nIn 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',<ref>Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.</ref> in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an \"arthrological\" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;<ref>See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.</ref> some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 }}</ref><ref>Montgomery, G. \"The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes\" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.</ref>\n\nThe [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.<ref>Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. \"Historical Aspects of Manual Communication\" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.<br />\nand Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)</ref>  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.\n\n[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.<ref>Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}</ref> He described such codes for both English and Latin.\n\nBy 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.<ref>Daniel Defoe (1720). \"The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell\"</ref> Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.\n\nFrenchman [[Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e|Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.<ref>Canlas (2006).</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College.

The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language.

While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.<ref>Johnston (1989).</ref> The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.<ref>Taub (2001).</ref> This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.\n\nSign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s, from the Greek word for \"hand\", in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s, from Greek for \"voice\", of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although crude distinctions are often also made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].<ref>Fabian Bross (2016).

More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions \"function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information\".<ref>Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research.

Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.{{Which|date=June 2019}}\n\nToday, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category \"sign languages\" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,<ref>p. 970-972.

Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as \"inventors\" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.\n\nAs a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.\n\nOn the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.<ref>Nakamura (1995).</ref>\n\nSimilarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.\n\n=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===\n[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|\"Hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\n[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of \"hello\" in ASL (American sign language)]]\nSign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.\n\nOne way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[Classifier constructions in sign languages|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.\n\nThe large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry<ref>Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.</ref> or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).\n\n=== Non-manual elements ===\nSign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.\n\nAt the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.<ref>Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |editor1=Josep Quer i Carbonell |editor2=Carlo Cecchetto |editor3=Rannveig Sverrisd \u00c3ttir |year=2017 |isbn=9781501511806 |oclc=1012688117}}</ref>\n\nWhile the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).<ref>Fabian Bross & Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}.

Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.<ref>Baker, Charlotte (1977).

New York: Academic Press</ref>\n\n=== Iconicity ===\n[[Iconicity]] is similarity or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to [[Arbitrariness#Linguistics|arbitrariness]]. The first studies on iconicity in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.<ref>Frishberg (1975)</ref><ref>Klima & Bellugi (1979)</ref> Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, when deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.<ref>Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. \"The Signs of Language.\" Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.</ref> Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.<ref>Brentari, Diane. \"Introduction.\" Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.</ref> Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.\n\nIn 1978, Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to suggest that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.<ref>Brown, R. (1978). ''Why Are Signed Languages Easier to Learn than Spoken Languages? Part Two. Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 32(3), 25.''{{doi|10.2307/3823113}}</ref>  In his study, Brown found that when a group of six hearing children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than another group of six children that were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties. In contrast to Brown, linguists [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]] and Richard Meier found that iconicity \"appears to have virtually no impact on the acquisition of American Sign Language\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The crosslinguistic study of language acquisition|last=Newport|first=Elissa|last2=Meier|first2=Richard|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1985|isbn=0898593670|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881 881\u2013938]|url=https://archive.org/details/crosslinguistics0001unse/page/881}}</ref>\n\nA central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or \"English on the hands.\" One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.\n\nThe [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.<ref name=\"Taub 2001\">Taub (2001)</ref> In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation (\"[[construal]]\" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.<ref>Wilcox (2004)</ref>\n\nThe cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.<ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\">Wilcox (2000)</ref> In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for \"ask\" has parts of its form that are iconic (\"movement away from the mouth\" means \"something coming from the mouth\"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).<ref name=\"Meir 2010\">Meir (2010)</ref>\n\nMany signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is \"learning\". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as \"double mapped\".<ref name=\"Taub 2001\"/><ref name=\"Wilcox 2000\"/><ref name=\"Meir 2010\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Classification ===\n{{See also|List of sign languages}}\n[[File:Sign language families.svg|thumb|300px|Sign language families I|\n|'''The classification of Sign Language families'''\n{{Legend|#5d6a8f|[[French Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#1e2f5d|[[American Sign Language]] (ASL) cluster}}\n{{Legend|#93a1c7|[[Russian Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#a8d3db|[[Czech Sign Language]] cluster}}\n{{Legend|#9c6cd0|[[Danish Sign Language]] family}}\n{{Legend|#a596d8|[[Swedish Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#b08660|[[German Sign Language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#660066|[[Vietnamese sign languages]] & some Thai and Lao SLs}}\n{{Legend|#383834|[[Arab sign-language family]]}}\n{{Legend|#99ff00|[[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#ff9691|[[Chinese Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#bd4b31|[[Japanese Sign Language family]] (including Taiwanese Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#4b874b|[[BANZSL]] family (British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language)}}\n{{Legend|#1c5e31|[[South African Sign Language]]}}\n{{Legend|#fff200|Isolated languages}}\n{{Legend|#e6e6e6|No data}}]]\nAlthough sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.\n\nSign languages may be classified by how they arise.\n\nIn non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.\n\nA [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |editor1-last= Marschark |editor1-first= Marc |editor2-last= Spencer |editor2-first= Patricia Elizabeth |title= Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0mmJAgAAQBAJ |volume= 2 |location= New York |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-539003-2 |oclc= 779907637 |access-date= 2016-11-05 }}</ref> The most famous of these is probably the extinct [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] of the US, but there are also numerous village languages scattered throughout Africa, Asia, and America.\n\n[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.\n\nBoth contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.\n\n[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&nbsp;\u2013 it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the \"gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa\", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.<ref>Frishberg (1987).

There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.\n** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].\n* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.\n* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.\n* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a \"cluster\" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.\n* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].\n* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].\n\nThe only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.<ref>Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.</ref> The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.{{refn |Wittmann's classification went into Ethnologue's database where it is still cited.<ref>{{cite web |editor1=Simons, Gary F. |editor2=Charles D.

He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Typology ===\n{{See also|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.\n\nSign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.\n\nSign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.\n\nBrentari<ref name=\"Brentari1998\">Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref><ref>Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35\u201336; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349</ref> classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).\n\nAnother aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zeshan | first1 = Ulrike | last2 = Ernesto Escobedo Delgado | first2 = Cesar | last3 = Dikyuva | first3 = Hasan | last4 = Panda | first4 = Sibaji | last5 = de Vos | first5 = Connie | year = 2013 | title = Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology | url = | journal = Linguistic Typology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 357\u2013396 }}</ref> Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.\n\n=== Acquisition ===\n{{See also|Language acquisition}}\n\nChildren who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}</ref>\n\nThe Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the [[brain plasticity|plasticity]] of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|website=ACFOS|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don't have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262\u2013290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}</ref>\n\n=== Written forms ===\n{{anchor|Notation}}<!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here -->\nSign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form.

Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press</ref> is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.\n* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.\n* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].\n* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.\n* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.\n* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).\n*The Alphabetic Writing System for sign languages (''Sistema de escritura alfab\u00e9tica'', SEA, by its Spanish name and acronym), developed by linguist \u00c1ngel Herrero Blanco and two deaf researchers, Juan Jos\u00e9 Alfaro and Inmacualada Cascales, was published as a book in 2003<ref>{{Cite book|title=Escritura alfab\u00e9tica de la Lengua de Signos Espa\u00f1ola : once lecciones|last=Herrero Blanco, \u00c1ngel L.|date=2003|publisher=Publicaciones de la Universidad de Alicante|others=Alfaro, Juan Jos\u00e9,, Cascales, Inmaculada|isbn=9781282574960|location=San Vicente del Raspeig [Alicante]|oclc=643124997}}</ref> and made accessible in [[Spanish Sign Language]] on-line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/seccion/signos/psegundonivel.jsp?seccion=signos&conten=materiales&pagina=cat_materiales1&tit3=Lecciones+de+escritura+alfab%25E9tica+de+LSE|title=Biblioteca de signos - Materiales|website=www.cervantesvirtual.com|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> This system makes use of the letters of the Latin alphabet with a few diacritics to represent sign through the morphemic sequence S L C Q D F (bimanual sign, place, contact, handshape, direction and internal form). The resulting words are meant to be read by signing. The system is designed to be applicable to any sign language with minimal modification and to be usable through any medium without special equipment or software. Non-manual elements can be encoded to some extent, but the authors argue that the system does not need to represent all elements of a sign to be practical, the same way written oral language doesn't.

It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.\nIn the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSigns may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.\n\n=== Legal recognition ===\n{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}\nSome sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.\n\nThe interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.\n\nWith recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent deep learning based [[machine translation of sign languages|machine translation algorithms]] have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Huang |first=Jie |last2=Zhou |first2=Wengang |last3=Zhang |first3=Qilin |last4=Li |first4=Houqiang |last5=Li |first5=Weiping |title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation |conference=32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), Feb. 2-7, 2018, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA |date=2018-01-30 |url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-29 |arxiv=1801.10111 }}</ref> \n{{clear}}\n\n=== Remote interpreting ===\n<!-- Note: the following text was originally copied from [[Language interpretation#Video interpreting|Language interpretation]]\nbut has been adapted extensively to fit into the context of this article.\n -->\n[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|upright|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]\n{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}\n\nInterpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.\n\nHowever, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Interpretation on television ===\n[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]\n\nSign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.\n\n[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.<ref>{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | accessdate=2008-01-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.<ref name=\"RNID\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 }}</ref>  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed.

Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.\n\n=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===\n{{Main|Manually coded language}}\n\nWhen Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.\n\n=== \"Baby sign language\" with hearing children ===\n{{Main|Baby sign language}}\n\nSome hearing parents teach signs to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs are seen as a beneficial option for better communication.<ref>Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.</ref> Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.{{cn|date=February 2020}} This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants. When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThis is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.\n\n=== Home sign ===\n{{Main|Home sign}}\n\nInformal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes \"kitchen sign\").<ref>Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow & Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].</ref>\n\nHome sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.<ref>The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard.
