Their homeland, the [[Lacandon Jungle]], lies along the Mexican side of the [[Usumacinta River]] and its tributaries. The Lacandon are one of the most isolated and culturally conservative of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexico's native peoples]]. Almost extinct in 1943, today their population has grown significantly, yet remains small, at approximately 650 speakers of the [[Lacandon language]].\n\n==Culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Map-Montes-Azules.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern part of the Mexican state of Chiapas, where the Lacandon region is located. The green area is the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]], which roughly coincides with the area designated to the ''Lacandon Community'' in 1971]] -->\nThe Lacandon escaped [[Conquistador|Spanish control]] throughout the colonial era by living in small, remote farming communities in the jungles of what is now Chiapas and the [[Guatemala]]n department of [[Pet\u00e9n (department)|El Pet\u00e9n]], avoiding contact with whites and [[Ladino people|Ladinos]]. Lacandon customs remain close to those of their [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n ancestors. As recently as the late 19th century some bound the heads of infants, resulting in the distinctively shaped foreheads seen in Classic [[Maya art]]. And well into the 20th century, they continued using bows and arrows and making arrowheads from flint they quarried in the rainforest. Today they sell versions of these to tourists.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century the Lacandon had little contact with the outside world. They worshiped their own [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[gods]] and [[goddesses]] in small huts set aside for religious worship at the edge of their villages. These sacred structures contain a shelf of clay [[incense]] burners, each decorated with the face of a Lacandon deity. The Lacandon also made [[pilgrimage]]s to [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya cities]] to pray and to remove stone pebbles from the ruins for ritual purposes. They believe that the Maya sites are places where their gods once dwelled before moving to new domains they constructed in the sky and below the earth. The Maya site of [[Bonampak]], famous for its preserved temple murals, became known to the outside world when Lacand\u00f3ns led American photographer Giles Healy there in 1946.\n\nA few Lacandon continue their traditional religious practices today, especially in the north around Lakes Naja and Metzabok. In the south, a [[yellow fever]] epidemic in the 1940s took many lives and caused a high degree of social disruption. The southern group abandoned their pantheon of gods in the 1950s and were later Christianized through the efforts of the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (SIL).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Southern Lacandon helped SIL missionaries translate the [[New Testament]] and parts of the [[Old Testament]] into their language. But in the north the spiritual leader Chan K'in, who lived to an advanced age and died in 1996, helped keep the ancient traditions alive. Chan K'in urged his people to maintain a respectful distance from the outside world, taking some things of value, but not allowing outside influences to overwhelm the Lacandon way of life.\n\n==Language==\nThe Lacandon speak a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] closely related to [[Yucatec Maya]]. In their own language they call themselves ''Hach Winik'' (\"Real People\", {{IPA-all|\u029cat\u0283\u02b0 \u028binik\u02b0|pron}}) and they call their language ''[[Lacandon language|Hach T'ana]]'' (\"Real Language\"). The Lacand\u00f3n have long been traders with other Maya in the area and have adopted some words of [[Ch'ol language|Ch'ol]] and [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]] into their lexicon. They have also created their own unique styles of speaking Spanish in some cases.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Details of the language of the northern group of Lacandon can be found at the Lacandon Cultural Heritage website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/lacandon/Language.htm|title=Language|website=Web.uvic.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Threats to cultural survival==\nLacandon interaction with the outside world has accelerated over the past 30 years. In the 1970s, the Mexican government began paying them for rights to log timber in their forests, bringing them into closer contact with the national economy. At the same time, the government built roads into the area, establishing new villages of [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] and [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] Indians who were far more exposed to the outside world than the Lacandon. The roads helped expand farming and logging, and severe deforestation occurred. Then, in the early 1990s, the Lacandon witnessed acts of violence during the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion in Chiapas. The Zapatistas issued a series of statements of their principles, each called a [[Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle|\"Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle]]\".\n\n[[Casa Na Bolom]] in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] is devoted to helping the Lacandon cope with the changes imposed on them in recent decades. A scientific and cultural institute, it was founded in 1951 by archaeologist [[Frans Blom]] and his wife, photographer [[Gertrude Blom|Gertrude \"Trudi\" Duby Blom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/trudiblom|title=Flickr|website=Flickr.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> [[Casa Na Bolom]] (\"House of the Jaguar\") does advocacy work for the Lacand\u00f3n, sponsors research on their history and culture, returns to them copies of photographs and other cultural documentation done by scholars over the years, and addresses environmental threats to the Lacandon Jungle, such as deforestation. Among its many projects, Casa Na Bolom has collaborated with a group of Swedish [[ethnomusicology]] students who recorded traditional Lacand\u00f3n songs. A publication of those recordings in CD form is now planned.\n\nSeveral linguists and anthropologists have done extensive studies of Lacandon language and culture, including Phillip Baer, a missionary linguist with [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] who lived among the Lacandon for more than 50 years, Roberto Bruce an American linguist who devoted his life to studying Lacandon language and culture, and [[Christian R\u00e4tsch]] who spent three years living with the Lacandon while studying their [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] and [[incantations]].\n\n==History==\n{{essay|section|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe first definite contact with the Lacandons occurred in the last decades of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |author=Eroza Solana, Enrique  |year=2006 |title=Lacandones |series=Pueblos ind\u00edgenas del M\u00e9xico contempor\u00e1neo |isbn=970-753-049-9 |oclc=71844580 |publisher=Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Desarollo de los Pueblos Ind\u00edgenas |location=Mexico City, Mexico |language=es |url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=21&Itemid=200020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230170910/http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=21&Itemid=200020 |archivedate=2014-12-30}}</ref> When scholars first investigated in the early 20th century, they thought that the Lacandon were the direct descendants of ancient [[Classic Maya]] people who fled into the rainforest at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Maya|Spanish Conquest]] and remained linguistically and culturally pristine ever since. They made that assumption because the Lacandons' physical appearance and dress is so similar to the way the ancient Maya portrayed themselves in their murals and relief carvings. Scholars were also impressed by the fact that \u201cthe Lacandon resided near the remote ruins of ancient Mayan cities, had the knowledge to survive in the tropical jungle, and were neither [[Christianity|Christian]] nor modernized\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> They thought that these native people were pure Maya untouched by the outside world. But in recent years researchers have revealed a more complex history for the Lacandon.\n\nScholars have now shown that the Lacandon are the result of a coming together of various lowland Mayan refugee groups during the period of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish colonial rule]]. Their \u201clanguage, clothing, and customs derive from several different Colonial Era Mayan ethnic groups\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> It appears that the Lacandon possess multiple origins and that their culture arose as different lowland Mayan groups escaped Spanish rule and fled into the forest. There was a blending of cultural elements as some traits of varied origin were retained while others were lost. The Lacandon seem to have arisen as a distinct ethnic group as late as the 18th century, meaning that they \u201ccannot be the direct descendants of the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] since their culture did not exist before it was generated through inter-indigenous interaction\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> \n\nThe Lacandon seem to have originated in the [[Campeche]] and [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] regions of what is now Mexico and Guatemala and moved into the Lacandon rainforest at the end of the 18th century, a thousand years after the Classic [[Maya civilization]] collapsed. Unlike other indigenous peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], though, they were not strongly affected by outside forces until the 19th century. While other Indians were living under the control of the [[Spain|Spanish]], the Lacandon lived independently deep in the tropical forest. Their independence allowed them to manage their contact with the outside world in a controlled way. Preserving their ethnic identity was not as effortless, though. The Lacandon deliberately remained in small, isolated groups in order to resist change. They used their inaccessibility and dispersed settlement pattern to protect their traditions.\n\nOutsiders avoided the Lacandon region for centuries due to frightening legends about the dense tropical forest. The Spanish\u2014and later the Mexicans, after they gained their independence\u2014sometimes made efforts to settle the region, but failed due to the lack of financial and political support. For generations the only connections the Lacandon had to the outside world came through trade. The Lacandon \u201coften initiated [trade and] sought metal tools, salt, cloth, and other European goods\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Outsiders, for their part, also desired goods from the forest, such as timber, animal skins, and fruits. Although trade was slow and infrequent, it did take place and it allowed for an intermingling of culture and material goods.\n\nIn the 19th century, outsiders looked toward the forest for valuable timber and new lands for farming. As the 19th century progressed, farmers and ranchers invaded the area, and the Lacandon withdrew farther into the forest, losing more and more land on the periphery of their territory. The Lacandon survived outright conquest, though, by adopting a flexible strategy that led them to accept, resist, or retreat from the imposing foreign culture depending on the circumstances.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nBy the late 20th century, though, the Lacandon were in frequent contact with outsiders within the area that had been their heartland. This resulted in territorial shifts, disease, and new powerful cultural influences. As logging began on a massive scale, the Lacandon came into contact often with forest workers, which resulted in wage work for some and an overall transformation of their culture, a process that continues to the present time. As development in the area took place, the [[Catholic Church]] established mission churches which converted many Lacandon. The Lacandon were drawn into the revolt of indigenous peoples that took place in the area in the 1980s and 1990s. They endured the pressure of cultural change as never before in their history. Their strategy of many generations to withdraw into the forest to preserve their traditional way of life now failed them.\n\nIn 1971 a Mexican presidential order turned 614,000 hectares over to the [[Lacandon Community]], thereby recognizing the land rights of this relatively small group of indigenous forest dwellers over the more numerous settlers, who had been encouraged to colonize the Lacandon Forest under previous government policies. But this did not put an end to the Lacandons' troubles. Ironically, this effort to save Lacandon culture resulted in enduring tensions between the Lacandon and their neighbors.\n\n==Religion==\nThroughout their history the ritual practices and beliefs of the Lacandon have shifted and evolved. Change has seemed more explicit as contact with the outside world has increased. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the differences between Lacandon religious practices prior to increased contact (19th century) and those afterwards. As a culturally conservative group of Native Mesoamericans, the Lacandon have maintained characteristics unique to themselves, including certain religious customs, despite the encroachment and influence of the outside world since the early 16th century. It is also important to recognize that while the Lacandon are culturally conservative, they were never isolationist as they had continued contact and trade with other Native Mesoamericans throughout their history. However, the Lacandon have been very secretive about their religious rituals throughout ethnographic history, which has led to many mysteries about the meanings and origins of certain rituals and beliefs. Another problem to consider is that the Lacandon are not an entirely homogeneous group, which has created difficulties for ethnographers in understanding the religious practices of the Lacandon both past and present. Significant differences may be found in ritual behavior related to geographic differences of Lacandon villages. Lacandon villages are small and dispersed throughout the jungle in [[Chiapas]]. A further geographic divide is evident between the Lacandon in lowland Chiapas near the Maya ruins of [[Bonampak]] and [[Yaxchil\u00e1n]] and the highland Lacand\u00f3n who reside closer to Lakes Naja and Metzabok within the jungle (see map at<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://dobes.mpi.nl/project_data/lacandon/geography_map.gif|format=GIF|title=Map of Lacandon|website=Dobes.mpi.nl|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>). Lacandon who reside in the southern part of the Chiapas jungle have been more exposed to outsiders, are more aggressive than their highland counterparts, have slightly different dress, and adopted the Christian faith more quickly.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\n===Religious practitioners===\nWhen contacts between Europeans and the Lacandon began being recorded it was believed that they were unchanged ancient Maya descended from those who fled initial Spanish contact and that they were complete with the ritual beliefs and physical appearance of their ancestors. The Lacandon refer to themselves as Hach Winik, or \u201creal people\u201d and report that they are descendants of the Maya. While the Lacandon share a history with the Maya, many of their religious practices are not found among the ancient Maya or other Maya groups. The Lacandon may identify a particular man in a village who has shown extensive ritual knowledge or ability as a healer or religious leader who then performs religious ceremonies. However, basic offerings and incense burning is performed by all male heads of household and generally theirs is an egalitarian society as far as leadership.<ref name=\"pal\" /> \n\nCeremonies usually have only male participants and are for a myriad of reasons including; feeding a particular god, a fertility rite, to help with agriculture, and frequently in response to illness. As contact from outsiders increased so did the occurrence of disease among the Lacand\u00f3n, and with that more rituals focused on healing. The prominence of particular Gods also increased with the influx of outsiders including a God the Lacandon recognize specifically for foreigners among other things.<ref name=\"Mc1\">McGee, Jon (2002) \"Watching Lacandon Maya Lives,\" Boston: Allyn and Bacon.</ref>\n\n===Gods===\nLacandon deities include K\u2019akoch, the god responsible for the creation of earth, sun, and other gods (who came from the flower of the bak nikte' ''[[Plumeria rubra]]''); K\u2019akoch does not interact with humans. Sukunkyum is held to be the first god to come from the bak nikte' and is reportedly in charge of the underworld and judging people's souls; Sukunkyum tends to the sun (when it disappears into the west) and the moon (during the day). [[Hachakyum|Hach\u00e4kyum]] is the younger brother of Sukunkyum; he is the most important deity because he created the jungle, animals, and man and woman (with the help of his wife).<ref name=\"Mc1\"/>\n\nIn the generation below Hachakyum, there are various mediating gods, such as his son Tuub (T'up) and his son-in-law Ah Kin ('Priest') Chob. Mens\u00e4b\u00e4k is the god of rain and is therefore very important to the Lacand\u00f3n. Mens\u00e4b\u00e4k can be traced back to the pre-Hispanic Maya god Yum Chac, who is also a god associated with rainfall. There are also gods associated with thunder and lightning (Hahanak'uh), earthquakes (Kisin), and war and disease (Ak K'ak'). Inexplicably, the Lacandon seem to have no maize deity, a deity which is present among all other Mayan groups.<ref name=\"Mc1\"/>\n\nMore recently, \u00c4kyantho', the god of foreigners, has become more prominent. This god, \u00c4kyantho', is described as a light-skinned god that wears a hat and carries a pistol. \u00c4kyantho' is responsible for trade, medicine, diseases, some animals (horses for example), and metal tools. He has a son named Hesuklistos (Jesus Christ) who is supposed to be the god of the foreigners. This is expressive of the Lacand\u00f3n cultural conservancy and adaptability, in that they fit new gods into their world view. They recognize that Hesuklistos is a god but do not feel he is worthy of worship as he is a minor god.<ref name=\"Mc1\"/>\n\n===Ceremonial buildings, sacred places, and objects of ritual practice===\nMost Lacandon villages have a God House where ceremonies take place. Some are located near the religious leaders abode or close to the home of a well-respected or elderly male. Some villages hide the God House away from the village in the jungle so that outsiders are unable to find them. Often these sites are also guarded and even shielded with vegetation so that the rituals performed inside cannot be seen. The God House is built very low to the ground so that it is hard to see into and it is oriented to North, South, East, and West with the entrance on the east side where it faces toward Maya ruins and the sunrise. Inside the God House are the necessities used for various ceremonies. These include drums suspended in the ceiling so they don\u2019t touch the ground until they are needed for ritual song and dance; a fire starter traditionally consisting of a fire drill (two sticks) and more recently a lighter, matches or flint; benches to sit around; ceramic bowls for preparing and eating ritual meals or offerings; a conch shell \u201ctrumpet\u201d to announce the beginning of a ceremony for both villagers and the gods; a large hollowed trough to make the alcohol [[Balch\u00e9]] for ritual consumption; and most importantly the God House contains rubber characters, incense nodules (made of [[copal]]), and ceramic God pots used to burn the offerings for the rituals. Sacred places included caves (where the sun went to the underworld each night), Maya ruins where the Gods had once resided, next to rivers, rock outcroppings or particular places in the jungle (there would not be any cutting of vegetation in these areas). These places are often remote, secret, and not to be viewed by outsiders.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nGod pots are small ceramic bowls that have the head and face of the deity they represent attached to the rim of the pot, often with the head tilted back so that incense or offerings may be placed directly on it. These pots are fired in the open and coated with a mixture of clay, lime, and water and then painted with red or black dyes. The pots have specific masculine or feminine designs including whether the head had straight (male) or braided (female) hair and whether the pot was striped (male) or checked (female). In addition, pots used for rituals are considered to be alive and to have a soul. To bring life to a God pot the Lacand\u00f3n would use small pebbles they found at Maya ruins that they considered sacred. They would also use cacao beans for the purpose of giving the pot a \u201cheart\u201d. Each God pot was made for a particular deity or ritual and if they remained in good condition they sometimes were given from father to son. When a god pot became full with incense, burnt offerings, or was broken, there would be a renewal ceremony to replace it. The old pot would be taken to a sacred place and left and then new ceramic incense burners and figurines were made (usually to be discarded later) as they created a new pot to take the place of the old.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\n===Offerings, rituals, and beliefs===\nOfferings burnt in the God pots included incense, food, and rubber figurines. The food was often thought to sustain the Gods and keep order in the universe. The figurines were made of sap from the [[Castilla elastica]] tree, which was seen as blood from the tree and is thought to represent the blood sacrifices in some of the Lacandon ceremonies. These figurines were usually in the form of humans with specific body parts clearly represented but at times were also in the form of animals. Part of the belief of the Lacand\u00f3n entailed the Gods being able to partake in the offerings in the God pot by the figurine being burned in the God pot and becoming a messenger for the particular God invoked. The smoke of the offering was seen as the essence, or soul (pixan) which is consumable by the gods.<ref name=\"Did\">Boremanse, Didier (1993). The Faith of the Real People: The Lacandon of the Chiapas Rain Forest. New York, NY. The Crossroad Publishing Company.</ref> Ultimately, there is not a great understanding of the exact meaning of the anthropomorphic rubber figures though the symbolism appears to be representative of human sacrifice.<ref name=\"pal\" /> It is known that the rubber figures would be splattered with red [[annatto]] dye before being burnt and that at sometime before the 19th century it was common for the Lacand\u00f3n to participate in bloodletting where they would cut their earlobe or septum and smear the figurine with blood before burning it. The belief was that the God could be sustained from the smoke of the burning blood. Other beliefs, which signify a potential history of human sacrifice, include some Gods preferring human flesh and sacrificing other Gods and also that at the end of the world the Gods would sacrifice humans and would paint their houses with the blood of the humans. The behavior of the Gods being similar to that of humans may point toward cannibalism and human sacrifice among the Lacand\u00f3n historically though these practices were non-existent or unknown by the 20th century.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nOther practices may have included ancestor worship as god pots and incense burners have been found at burial sites. Reports of cremation burials (Baer and Baer, 1952) exist as well as ritual links to astronomy and dream interpretation. Not much is known about these practices.<ref name=\"pal\" /> A specific belief regarding the god Akyantho\u2019 is that he had first given the Lacand\u00f3n tools, medicine, animals, liquor, and other trade associated items but then took them away and gave them to foreigners because they were taking better care of these items. As a punishment for their irresponsibility, the Lacand\u00f3n had to interact with the foreigners in order to obtain what they needed.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In addition, the Lacand\u00f3n believed that their Gods had once dwelled in the ruins along with their ancestors. Many rituals were performed at these sites as evidenced by the numerous god pots found throughout. Breaking any of the rocks or damaging the buildings of the ruins was seen as disrespecting the Gods.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> Often these places were guarded but the increasing interruption of ceremonies along with the damaging of the sites and the god pots there forced the Lacand\u00f3n back into the jungles to perform their rituals privately.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Didier Boremanse, in the book ''South and Meso-American Native Spirituality'', gives some detailed accounts of specific rituals that he witnessed (pp.&nbsp;324\u2013351).<ref name=\"Did\" />\n\n==External influences==\nWhile the Lacand\u00f3n have recently seen an influx of outside influence with the coming of roads, logging, tourism, and other modernizations, it is important to recognize that they have had contact with outsiders throughout their history. It should also be noted that the Lacand\u00f3n were often the initiators of contact with foreigners (including other Mayan groups). Outside contact was usually facilitated by trade and religious conversion.<ref name=\"pal\" /> If we examine photographs and drawings of the Lacand\u00f3n dating from the late 19th century, we can see that their clothing and personal adornments have changed considerably. These valuable historical images show that cultural change has been taking place among the Lacand\u00f3n for a long time.\n\nThe Lacand\u00f3n have sometimes gone into nearby towns to participate in Catholic mass or other rituals performed by priests. The ritual of baptism was of particular interest, possibly because they perceived a cleansing and therapeutic value for that ritual.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Initially, attempts by [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|capuchin]] priests and other missionaries to Christianize the Lacand\u00f3n were unsuccessful. The priests repeatedly tried to emphasize the importance of monogamy in their religion, which may have led to the initial general non-acceptance of the religion. Polygyny was seen by the male Lacand\u00f3n as a way to ensure labor and economic power, retain ritual knowledge in food preparation, and maintain fertility among wives at different times.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> The Christian religion provided somewhat of a break for Lacand\u00f3n women because there was no need for the exhaustive process and knowledge base of preparing ritual foods for ceremonies. Because of this, and their exclusion from the traditional ceremonies other than cooking, many Lacand\u00f3n women asked their husbands to convert to Christianity.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the geographic differences among the Lacand\u00f3n may have influenced the rate at which Christian conversion occurred. It is noted that the lowland Lacand\u00f3n have all but abandoned the historical religion while those in the highlands still practice some traditional rituals. The need for privacy for the rites to be performed and outsider interruption likely has something to do with this as well.<ref name=\"pal\" /> The use of music and dance has also decreased in ritual behavior inexplicably since ethnographers began studying the Lacand\u00f3n. Today, it is possible to buy god pots made by the Lacand\u00f3n specifically for tourists. These pots are not painted and have not been given \u201csouls\u201d and therefore are not alive and can be sold.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> Jon McGee (2002) notes that increased participation in a monetary economy because of tourists has decreased the need for subsistence agriculture and with it the religious rites associated with agriculture.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> Other changes include the simplification of god pot designs, the non-existence of once very important pilgrimages to particular sites (because they have been desecrated), disappearance of bloodletting, and rarity of polygyny. Besides the influence of outsiders, these changes can also be attributed to deaths of the elders and knowledgeable persons who practiced the rituals through old age and often disease. Information was not passed on to younger generations, which opened a place for Christian missionaries to convert more Lacand\u00f3n. For this reason Protestantism is the dominant religion of the lowland Lacand\u00f3n today. John McGee (2002) has noted that within four years of the introduction of television, traditional ritual practices among the highland Lacand\u00f3n has been reduced to just two families and one individual. Many others no longer participate in any religion at this point.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\n==Economy==\nThe historic Lacand\u00f3n were neither strictly hunter-gatherers nor swidden agriculturalists, but rather, they were both as they saw fit. Likewise, they were at one time either mobile or sedentary.<ref name=\"pal\" /> The Lacand\u00f3n would make clearings in the forest to raise crops and some livestock, but they would also hunt and fish, and gather roots and plants in the jungle. As such, they had no need for a structured economy, as they relied on their own homesteads as their source of sustenance. The more contact that the Lacand\u00f3n had with other people, the more their economy morphed.\n\nThe historic Lacand\u00f3n would at times trade with outsiders, but there is little to no documentation regarding this contact. What trade was documented showed that it was the most contact the Lacand\u00f3n had with the outside world at the time. They traded animals, honey, bee\u2019s wax, tobacco, cotton, and cacao for much-needed metal tools. As time progressed into the 19th and 20h centuries, the goods the Lacand\u00f3n were given during trade became more advanced, such as firearms, kerosene, coffee, sugar, and clothing among other things.<ref name=\"pal\" /> There is evidence that showed that some Lacand\u00f3n kept regular trade with ranches in Chiapas, and through contact learned languages such as Spanish, [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]], and [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]] Maya. This allowed the Lacand\u00f3n to more easily understand [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal Maya]] culture and Christianity.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nTo the Lacand\u00f3n, trade with foreigners was the most vital, and once only way for them to come into contact with the outside world, and for them to obtain things that they themselves cannot produce. Throughout time one can see the advancement of technology reaching the Lacand\u00f3n. The increased trade in the 19th century also influenced change in the Lacand\u00f3n subsistence. They started raising chickens, cultivating oranges, plantains, sugar cane, and instead of hunting with bows and arrows, were hunting with rifles.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nSome Lacand\u00f3n would gain employment from [[wikt:Ladino|Ladinos]] in logging camps, and others would receive payment from logging camps for rights to log in their jungle. By the end of the 19th century and beginning of the twentieth, tourists would come to the Lacand\u00f3n villages and purchase material items like gourd bowls, bows, and arrowheads.\n\nAs other indigenous people were given land in the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle, the common practice of subsistence farming was replaced by semi commercial agriculture of the new people that were given land in the area. This was further influenced by the national government\u2019s encouragement of the development of commercial farming, and not the typical [[slash and burn]] practices that were historically common in the area.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In addition to that, rapid deforestation of the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle due to cattle grazing led the Lacand\u00f3n to move from their dispersed settlements to more centralized communities, thus shifting their economic practices.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In the early 1970s, oil developments in [[Tabasco]] put money into Chiapas, and allowed for the Mexican government to set up a Rain forest reserve, preventing areas of the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle from being used by logging companies. However, after gaining control of the local extension of the Florida-based logging company Weiss Fricker Mahogany Company, the Mexican government organization Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA), which controlled the revenue generated by logging in the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle. A state-controlled company, the Compa\u00f1ia Forestal de la Lacandon S.A., was created to contract Lacand\u00f3n communities for logging rights of their land. Unfortunately, NAFINSA controlled most of the royalties made by the company, 70%, as opposed to the 30% that the Lacand\u00f3n communities received.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\nFollowing the oil price crash in the early 1980s, the value of the peso dropped dramatically, which made international tourism even more attractive. Though this affected the economy of the Lacand\u00f3n adversely, it presented an opportunity for them to gain. Lacand\u00f3n men would dedicate a good amount of their free time towards manufacturing arts and crafts, and then selling their goods to tourists in the larger towns in Chiapas, like [[Palenque]].<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In 1980, a road was built to connect Palenque with the Lacand\u00f3n community of Nah\u00e1. This allowed tourist traffic to flow into Lacand\u00f3n communities, and the Lacand\u00f3n merchant selling material goods no longer had to travel for days, but rather set up his shop along the road, and could carry more items with the advent of vehicular travel in the area.\n\nOne of the biggest items sold to tourists are hunting kits - bows and arrows. Men making these bows and arrows transitioned from acquiring the materials from the jungle themselves, to just buying the materials and focused strictly on the production of the bows and arrows. These are usually sold at the Maya ruins at Palenque and range in sizes - from full adult sizes to child-sized toys kits.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\nThe historical Lacand\u00f3n needed to rely on only themselves. But as they came into contact with other people, and Mexico became a more unified state, their economy shifted towards a more dependent one, thriving on increased trade with other local people and eventually were introduced with international trade.\n\n==Geography and land use==\nThe Lacand\u00f3n became associated as being isolated from other groups, a fact which was facilitated largely by the geographical setting in which they lived. The geography led many to be discouraged from venturing into the Lacand\u00f3n lands, and the result was that the Lacand\u00f3n people were never completely \u201cconquered\u201d as was the case with other indigenous groups in [[Mesoamerica]]. The rugged terrain and thick forests which characterize the Lacand\u00f3n lands in the eastern sector of the present-day Mexican state of [[Chiapas]] (see map at<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />) acted somewhat as a barrier to social interaction outside of the small and dispersed groups in which the Lacand\u00f3n lived from pre-Conquest times up to the 20th century.<ref name=\"pal\">Palka, Joel W. Unconquered Lacandon Maya. Gainesville, Fl: University Press of Florida, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe [[southern Maya lowlands]] which are home to the Lacand\u00f3n are characterized by rugged karstic topography and sub-tropical rainforest, known as the [[Selva Lacandona]], or the Lacandon Forest. Several rivers feed into the eastern Chiapas region, such as the [[Pasion River|Pasi\u00f3n]], [[San Pedro River (Guatemala)|San Pedro Martir]], [[Lacant\u00fan River|Lacant\u00fan]], [[Jatat\u00e9 River|Jatat\u00e9]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[Chixoy River|Chixoy]]. The rivers, along with many lakes, swamps and shorelines, contribute to the diversity of the Lacand\u00f3n lands. The availability of various types of flora and fauna which inhabit these aquatic and terrestrial areas have allowed the Lacand\u00f3n to thrive in a geographical setting which at first glance appears to be hostile to humans. In order to take full advantage of their resources, the Lacand\u00f3n have used specific agricultural, hunting and gathering techniques which have been designed to be conservative of the land and ecozone as a whole, which allows for sustainable use and therefore continued yield in the future. 20% of the approximately 700 Lacand\u00f3n people living today continue to use such techniques.<ref name=\"na1\">Nations, James D. \u201cThe Evolutionary Potential of Lacandon Maya Sustained-yield Tropical Forest Agriculture.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 36.1 (1980): 1-30.</ref>\n\nJames Nations recognizes four zones which the Lacand\u00f3n utilize to maintain a diverse food supply and healthy diet. The primary or old growth forest consists of small portions of tropical rain forest and lower mountainous rain forest, which constitutes the majority of the forest ecosystem.<ref name=\"na1\" /> While the growth in this type of rainforest is not quite as tall as that seen in a tropical rainforest, the two largely share the same characteristics (see interactive map at<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://elistas.egrupos.net/lista/encuentrohumboldt/archivo/indice/1442/msg/1484/cid/009701c5e539$94fd9330$0100000a@humboldt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723112723/http://elistas.egrupos.net/lista/encuentrohumboldt/archivo/indice/1442/msg/1484/cid/009701c5e539$94fd9330$0100000a@humboldt |archive-date=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and map at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiapaspictures.com/albums/userpics/normal_selva~0.jpg|format=JPG|title=Map of Lacandon : Photogrphic image|website=Chiapaspictures.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>). The primary growth forest provides hunting for the Lacand\u00f3n, as deer, [[peccary]], [[agouti]], and monkeys inhabit the area.<ref name=\"na1\" /> The Lacand\u00f3n also utilize the many different plant species in the rainforest for various purposes, including dietary and medicinal; the medicinal use of plants is well-developed amongst the Lacand\u00f3n and is important in their culture.<ref>Kashanipour, Ryan Amir and R. Jon McGee. \u201cNorthern Lacandon Maya Medicinal Plant Use in the Communities of Lacanja Chan Sayab and Naha\u2019, Chiapas, Mexico.\u201d Journal of Ecological Anthropology 8 (2004): 47-59.</ref> This zone is also very important for the maintenance of rich and stable soil, of which the Lacand\u00f3n take advantage in their [[milpa]] systems, the second zone.\n\nThe milpa, or farmed field, is crucial to the survival of the Lacand\u00f3n people. Here, they utilize sustainable [[slash and burn]] techniques to ensure the continued richness of the soils of the milpa and health of the region in general. The Lacand\u00f3n people engage in swidden agriculture on a primary or secondary growth forest in January, February or March, and allow the remains to dry until April. During this time, fire breaks are also put into place so as to keep the coming burn from catching other parts of the forest on fire. The firing occurs in April and planting begins soon thereafter. Different crops are grown together in the milpa amongst each other, such that plants of a single crop are separated from one another and surrounded by different crops. Also, tree species (bananas, plantains, etc.) are interspersed amongst maize and vine plants such as squash and chiles,<ref name=\"pal\" /> and root crops are cultivated in the ground under these. Plants are harvested in November or December after the rainy season which begins in May or June.<ref name=\"na1\" /> This cycle will be repeated for 2 to 5 years, at which time the milpa will be replanted with trees and allowed to be repopulated with wild forest plant species (this zone is then referred to as an [[acahual]]). After 5 to 7 years, the land will be used as a milpa again. After this second period of time used as a milpa, however, the land will be replanted with trees and allowed to develop into a mature secondary forest (at least 20 years), at which time it will be used as a milpa again.<ref name=\"na1\" />\n\nThe third zone, as mentioned above, is the acahual. The Lacand\u00f3n farmers replant the milpa in tree crops such as rubber or fruit and reap the direct benefits from the plants. The Lacand\u00f3n also use the acahual as a type of hunting ground, as the animals discussed above frequent the acahaul to graze or eat.<ref name=\"na1\" />\n\nThe last major zone in the Lacand\u00f3n lands is that which is near water, such as river banks, stream beds, swamps, and shorelines. The aquatic areas provide the Lacand\u00f3n with additional sources of protein and a different nutrient base from that which is provided by the terrestrial zones. The people use a specific type of snail species (''[[Pachychilus]]'' spp.) known locally as t\u2019unu as a type of protein supplement to their diet.<ref name=\"na2\">Nations, James D. \u201cSnail Shells and Maize Preparation: A Lacandon Maya Analogy.\u201d American Antiquity 44.3 (1979): 568-571.</ref> In addition, the shells from this organism provide great nutritional value, as they provide calcium and lime when burned. The lime is then added to maize to release amino acids such as tryptophan and lysine and the vitamin niacin, which would otherwise be unavailable from the maize (unable to be metabolized) if the lime were not added.<ref name=\"na2\" />\n\nBy utilizing the primary forest, milpas, acahuales and aquatic areas, the Lacand\u00f3n have been able to provide a healthy diet for themselves which has contributed to their ongoing survival.\n\n[[Image:Lacanj\u00e1ByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|A small dugout canoe in the Lacand\u00f3n village of Lacanj\u00e1 in 2001.]]\n\n==Archaeology==\nThree sites have been excavated and yielded artifacts that are historically Lacand\u00f3n, El Caobal, Matamangos and El Magal. The location of these abandoned Lacand\u00f3n sites have been passed down through generations of fathers taking their sons to the sites for hunting or exploring. The locals who had traveled there as children are the last informants who know the location of the Lacand\u00f3n settlements. Since the Lacand\u00f3n did not typically build \u201cstone-and-earth\u201d platforms it is almost impossible to find their lost settlements, making the knowledge of the elder locals crucial.\n\nEach site yielded different artifacts, some proved evidence of a home or residences, others may have been manufacturing sites. All show strong evidence of Lacand\u00f3n inhabitance. The easiest characteristic of Lacand\u00f3n settlement to spot is the presence of non-native vegetation such as fruit trees. Another being traditional Lacand\u00f3n pottery. The ceramic vessels found at all of the sites were dark brown and black with dark clouding on both the inside and outside and had a hemispherical shape. The hemispherical shape mimicked the familiar shape of the gourd vessels that were also very important. The gourds had a practical form and were used often for ritual food and drink. The rims of the ceramic vessels were squared off, as if they had been cut with a knife before being fired. Unlike Lacand\u00f3n gourd bowls, which were typically decorated with carved designs, the ceramic vessels had no designs or adornments. This might have shown some insight as to why they were left behind, perhaps they were so simple and easily produced that they were left behind and new vessels were made after the tribe migrated to a new location.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nThe first site discovered near the ruins of [[Dos Pilas]] was El Caobal, located on raised terrain and surrounded by swamp. In Spanish, caobal means \u201cplace or abundance of mahogany trees,\u201d this refers to the large concentration of them which most likely due to planting by the Lacand\u00f3n who relied on them for canoes and also because mahogany trees are not indigenous. El Caobal also has a large amount of mango and banana trees, which are also non-native, which were planted by the Lacand\u00f3n as a source of food. Beneath the jungle floor laid hundreds of artifacts including pottery, stone tools, metal pots and broken glass to name a few. Some of the artifacts were brought up by root action or a metal detector located and others were found from blind digs. The abundance of artifacts suggests the location a home or possibly a discard zone. The local artifacts that were found included utilitarian ceramics and stone tools, imported items consisted of white earthenware vessels with painted designs, glass bottles and metal tools.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nAt Matamangos, the site approximately one kilometer from El Caobal is identified by its abundance of mango trees (again showing that non-indigenous vegetation points to settlement). Matamangos was also on slightly raised ground and was located near a small group of Maya house mounds. After deciding to dig near one of the largest mango trees large amounts of [[chert]] debris such as chert cores, [[arrowheads]] and small blades were uncovered, another object that is characteristically Lacand\u00f3n. Chert was a hard stone that the Lacand\u00f3n used to make arrowheads and other [[Stone tool|lithic]] tools. A large piece of chert (also called a core) would first be heated and then bone is struck with a round [[hammerstone]] (made of volcanic rock) against the core, using indirect percussion fragments were chipped off to make prismatic chert blades. A hammerstone (probably imported from the Guatemalan highlands) was also found nearby the chert fragments. The stone was identified as being a hammerstone because of its smooth and rounded from use and fits comfortably in the hand and has scratches and chips from use. The uncovering of these related artifacts suggests possibly a tool manufacturing area or a discard site.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nKnown as El Mangal or \u201cplace of many mango trees\u201d by the locals, this site has trees that were much larger than those at Caobal or Matamangos. The area also had a lagoon that was known on regional maps as \u201cEl Mangal\u201d (showing a knowledge of the area by people other than the locals). The water in the lagoon is not good for drinking or cooking but it useful for washing and catching fish. A current family has made residence at El Mangal and has unearthed a whole machete, they also found pieces of thick, hard, brown pottery (traditional Lacand\u00f3n ceramic). While digging a trash pit the family found more pottery, although it was not the traditional smooth bowls that had been found at El Caobal, they were still ethnographically Lacand\u00f3n. The vessels were identified as incense burners. The shape was hemispherical with a ring base and a hole for venting the fire and releasing smoke. Unlike the smooth ceramics used for every day life these vessels were adorned with the modeled head of a deity on the rim, proving this object is used for religious rites. The modeled heads \u201cclosely resemble those made by the ethnographic Lacandon.\u201d Other decorations include incised lines and holes down the front of the bowl and protruding spikes. These vessels were used in \u201cGod houses\u201d for religious purposes. During the Lacand\u00f3n incense burner renewal ceremony men isolated themselves from the community and crafted the burners in solitude. They were placed in the god house and the old burners were deposited at a sacred place in the forest. The presence of these incense burners points possibly to a religious god house, a manufacturing site or even a sacred place of disposal.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chiapas conflict]]\n* [[Kejache]]\n* [[Lakandon Ch'ol]]\n* [[Maya civilization]]\n* [[List of Mayan languages]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*A\u00edda, Rosalva, Hern\u00e1ndez, Castillo (2001).

Their homeland, the [[Lacandon Jungle]], lies along the Mexican side of the [[Usumacinta River]] and its tributaries. The Lacandon are one of the most isolated and culturally conservative of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexico's native peoples]]. Almost extinct in 1943, today their population has grown significantly, yet remains small, at approximately 650 speakers of the [[Lacandon language]].\n\n==Culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Map-Montes-Azules.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern part of the Mexican state of Chiapas, where the Lacandon region is located. The green area is the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]], which roughly coincides with the area designated to the ''Lacandon Community'' in 1971]] -->\nThe Lacandon escaped [[Conquistador|Spanish control]] throughout the colonial era by living in small, remote farming communities in the jungles of what is now Chiapas and the [[Guatemala]]n department of [[Pet\u00e9n (department)|El Pet\u00e9n]], avoiding contact with whites and [[Ladino people|Ladinos]]. Lacandon customs remain close to those of their [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n ancestors. As recently as the late 19th century some bound the heads of infants, resulting in the distinctively shaped foreheads seen in Classic [[Maya art]]. And well into the 20th century, they continued using bows and arrows and making arrowheads from flint they quarried in the rainforest. Today they sell versions of these to tourists.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century the Lacandon had little contact with the outside world. They worshiped their own [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[gods]] and [[goddesses]] in small huts set aside for religious worship at the edge of their villages. These sacred structures contain a shelf of clay [[incense]] burners, each decorated with the face of a Lacandon deity. The Lacandon also made [[pilgrimage]]s to [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya cities]] to pray and to remove stone pebbles from the ruins for ritual purposes. They believe that the Maya sites are places where their gods once dwelled before moving to new domains they constructed in the sky and below the earth. The Maya site of [[Bonampak]], famous for its preserved temple murals, became known to the outside world when Lacand\u00f3ns led American photographer Giles Healy there in 1946.\n\nA few Lacandon continue their traditional religious practices today, especially in the north around Lakes Naja and Metzabok. In the south, a [[yellow fever]] epidemic in the 1940s took many lives and caused a high degree of social disruption. The southern group abandoned their pantheon of gods in the 1950s and were later Christianized through the efforts of the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (SIL).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Southern Lacandon helped SIL missionaries translate the [[New Testament]] and parts of the [[Old Testament]] into their language. But in the north the spiritual leader Chan K'in, who lived to an advanced age and died in 1996, helped keep the ancient traditions alive. Chan K'in urged his people to maintain a respectful distance from the outside world, taking some things of value, but not allowing outside influences to overwhelm the Lacandon way of life.\n\n==Language==\nThe Lacandon speak a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] closely related to [[Yucatec Maya]]. In their own language they call themselves ''Hach Winik'' (\"Real People\", {{IPA-all|\u029cat\u0283\u02b0 \u028binik\u02b0|pron}}) and they call their language ''[[Lacandon language|Hach T'ana]]'' (\"Real Language\"). The Lacand\u00f3n have long been traders with other Maya in the area and have adopted some words of [[Ch'ol language|Ch'ol]] and [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]] into their lexicon. They have also created their own unique styles of speaking Spanish in some cases.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Details of the language of the northern group of Lacandon can be found at the Lacandon Cultural Heritage website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/lacandon/Language.htm|title=Language|website=Web.uvic.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Threats to cultural survival==\nLacandon interaction with the outside world has accelerated over the past 30 years. In the 1970s, the Mexican government began paying them for rights to log timber in their forests, bringing them into closer contact with the national economy. At the same time, the government built roads into the area, establishing new villages of [[Tzeltal people|Tseltal]] and [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] Indians who were far more exposed to the outside world than the Lacandon. The roads helped expand farming and logging, and severe deforestation occurred. Then, in the early 1990s, the Lacandon witnessed acts of violence during the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion in Chiapas. The Zapatistas issued a series of statements of their principles, each called a [[Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle|\"Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle]]\".\n\n[[Casa Na Bolom]] in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] is devoted to helping the Lacandon cope with the changes imposed on them in recent decades. A scientific and cultural institute, it was founded in 1951 by archaeologist [[Frans Blom]] and his wife, photographer [[Gertrude Blom|Gertrude \"Trudi\" Duby Blom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/trudiblom|title=Flickr|website=Flickr.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> [[Casa Na Bolom]] (\"House of the Jaguar\") does advocacy work for the Lacand\u00f3n, sponsors research on their history and culture, returns to them copies of photographs and other cultural documentation done by scholars over the years, and addresses environmental threats to the Lacandon Jungle, such as deforestation. Among its many projects, Casa Na Bolom has collaborated with a group of Swedish [[ethnomusicology]] students who recorded traditional Lacand\u00f3n songs. A publication of those recordings in CD form is now planned.\n\nSeveral linguists and anthropologists have done extensive studies of Lacandon language and culture, including Phillip Baer, a missionary linguist with [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] who lived among the Lacandon for more than 50 years, Roberto Bruce an American linguist who devoted his life to studying Lacandon language and culture, and [[Christian R\u00e4tsch]] who spent three years living with the Lacandon while studying their [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] and [[incantations]].\n\n==History==\n{{essay|section|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe first definite contact with the Lacandons occurred in the last decades of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |author=Eroza Solana, Enrique  |year=2006 |title=Lacandones |series=Pueblos ind\u00edgenas del M\u00e9xico contempor\u00e1neo |isbn=970-753-049-9 |oclc=71844580 |publisher=Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Desarollo de los Pueblos Ind\u00edgenas |location=Mexico City, Mexico |language=es |url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=21&Itemid=200020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230170910/http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=21&Itemid=200020 |archivedate=2014-12-30}}</ref> When scholars first investigated in the early 20th century, they thought that the Lacandon were the direct descendants of ancient [[Classic Maya]] people who fled into the rainforest at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Maya|Spanish Conquest]] and remained linguistically and culturally pristine ever since. They made that assumption because the Lacandons' physical appearance and dress is so similar to the way the ancient Maya portrayed themselves in their murals and relief carvings. Scholars were also impressed by the fact that \u201cthe Lacandon resided near the remote ruins of ancient Mayan cities, had the knowledge to survive in the tropical jungle, and were neither [[Christianity|Christian]] nor modernized\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> They thought that these native people were pure Maya untouched by the outside world. But in recent years researchers have revealed a more complex history for the Lacandon.\n\nScholars have now shown that the Lacandon are the result of a coming together of various lowland Mayan refugee groups during the period of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish colonial rule]]. Their \u201clanguage, clothing, and customs derive from several different Colonial Era Mayan ethnic groups\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> It appears that the Lacandon possess multiple origins and that their culture arose as different lowland Mayan groups escaped Spanish rule and fled into the forest. There was a blending of cultural elements as some traits of varied origin were retained while others were lost. The Lacandon seem to have arisen as a distinct ethnic group as late as the 18th century, meaning that they \u201ccannot be the direct descendants of the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] since their culture did not exist before it was generated through inter-indigenous interaction\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> \n\nThe Lacandon seem to have originated in the [[Campeche]] and [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] regions of what is now Mexico and Guatemala and moved into the Lacandon rainforest at the end of the 18th century, a thousand years after the Classic [[Maya civilization]] collapsed. Unlike other indigenous peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], though, they were not strongly affected by outside forces until the 19th century. While other Indians were living under the control of the [[Spain|Spanish]], the Lacandon lived independently deep in the tropical forest. Their independence allowed them to manage their contact with the outside world in a controlled way. Preserving their ethnic identity was not as effortless, though. The Lacandon deliberately remained in small, isolated groups in order to resist change. They used their inaccessibility and dispersed settlement pattern to protect their traditions.\n\nOutsiders avoided the Lacandon region for centuries due to frightening legends about the dense tropical forest. The Spanish\u2014and later the Mexicans, after they gained their independence\u2014sometimes made efforts to settle the region, but failed due to the lack of financial and political support. For generations the only connections the Lacandon had to the outside world came through trade. The Lacandon \u201coften initiated [trade and] sought metal tools, salt, cloth, and other European goods\u201d.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Outsiders, for their part, also desired goods from the forest, such as timber, animal skins, and fruits. Although trade was slow and infrequent, it did take place and it allowed for an intermingling of culture and material goods.\n\nIn the 19th century, outsiders looked toward the forest for valuable timber and new lands for farming. As the 19th century progressed, farmers and ranchers invaded the area, and the Lacandon withdrew farther into the forest, losing more and more land on the periphery of their territory. The Lacandon survived outright conquest, though, by adopting a flexible strategy that led them to accept, resist, or retreat from the imposing foreign culture depending on the circumstances.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nBy the late 20th century, though, the Lacandon were in frequent contact with outsiders within the area that had been their heartland. This resulted in territorial shifts, disease, and new powerful cultural influences. As logging began on a massive scale, the Lacandon came into contact often with forest workers, which resulted in wage work for some and an overall transformation of their culture, a process that continues to the present time. As development in the area took place, the [[Catholic Church]] established mission churches which converted many Lacandon. The Lacandon were drawn into the revolt of indigenous peoples that took place in the area in the 1980s and 1990s. They endured the pressure of cultural change as never before in their history. Their strategy of many generations to withdraw into the forest to preserve their traditional way of life now failed them.\n\nIn 1971 a Mexican presidential order turned 614,000 hectares over to the [[Lacandon Community]], thereby recognizing the land rights of this relatively small group of indigenous forest dwellers over the more numerous settlers, who had been encouraged to colonize the Lacandon Forest under previous government policies. But this did not put an end to the Lacandons' troubles. Ironically, this effort to save Lacandon culture resulted in enduring tensions between the Lacandon and their neighbors.\n\n==Religion==\nThroughout their history the ritual practices and beliefs of the Lacandon have shifted and evolved. Change has seemed more explicit as contact with the outside world has increased. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the differences between Lacandon religious practices prior to increased contact (19th century) and those afterwards. As a culturally conservative group of Native Mesoamericans, the Lacandon have maintained characteristics unique to themselves, including certain religious customs, despite the encroachment and influence of the outside world since the early 16th century. It is also important to recognize that while the Lacandon are culturally conservative, they were never isolationist as they had continued contact and trade with other Native Mesoamericans throughout their history. However, the Lacandon have been very secretive about their religious rituals throughout ethnographic history, which has led to many mysteries about the meanings and origins of certain rituals and beliefs. Another problem to consider is that the Lacandon are not an entirely homogeneous group, which has created difficulties for ethnographers in understanding the religious practices of the Lacandon both past and present. Significant differences may be found in ritual behavior related to geographic differences of Lacandon villages. Lacandon villages are small and dispersed throughout the jungle in [[Chiapas]]. A further geographic divide is evident between the Lacandon in lowland Chiapas near the Maya ruins of [[Bonampak]] and [[Yaxchil\u00e1n]] and the highland Lacand\u00f3n who reside closer to Lakes Naja and Metzabok within the jungle (see map at<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://dobes.mpi.nl/project_data/lacandon/geography_map.gif|format=GIF|title=Map of Lacandon|website=Dobes.mpi.nl|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>). Lacandon who reside in the southern part of the Chiapas jungle have been more exposed to outsiders, are more aggressive than their highland counterparts, have slightly different dress, and adopted the Christian faith more quickly.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\n===Religious practitioners===\nWhen contacts between Europeans and the Lacandon began being recorded it was believed that they were unchanged ancient Maya descended from those who fled initial Spanish contact and that they were complete with the ritual beliefs and physical appearance of their ancestors. The Lacandon refer to themselves as Hach Winik, or \u201creal people\u201d and report that they are descendants of the Maya. While the Lacandon share a history with the Maya, many of their religious practices are not found among the ancient Maya or other Maya groups. The Lacandon may identify a particular man in a village who has shown extensive ritual knowledge or ability as a healer or religious leader who then performs religious ceremonies. However, basic offerings and incense burning is performed by all male heads of household and generally theirs is an egalitarian society as far as leadership.<ref name=\"pal\" /> \n\nCeremonies usually have only male participants and are for a myriad of reasons including; feeding a particular god, a fertility rite, to help with agriculture, and frequently in response to illness. As contact from outsiders increased so did the occurrence of disease among the Lacand\u00f3n, and with that more rituals focused on healing. The prominence of particular Gods also increased with the influx of outsiders including a God the Lacandon recognize specifically for foreigners among other things.<ref name=\"Mc1\">McGee, Jon (2002) \"Watching Lacandon Maya Lives,\" Boston: Allyn and Bacon.</ref>\n\n===Gods===\nLacandon deities include K\u2019akoch, the god responsible for the creation of earth, sun, and other gods (who came from the flower of the bak nikte' ''[[Plumeria rubra]]''); K\u2019akoch does not interact with humans. Sukunkyum is held to be the first god to come from the bak nikte' and is reportedly in charge of the underworld and judging people's souls; Sukunkyum tends to the sun (when it disappears into the west) and the moon (during the day). [[Hachakyum|Hach\u00e4kyum]] is the younger brother of Sukunkyum; he is the most important deity because he created the jungle, animals, and man and woman (with the help of his wife).<ref name=\"Mc1\"/>\n\nIn the generation below Hachakyum, there are various mediating gods, such as his son Tuub (T'up) and his son-in-law Ah Kin ('Priest') Chob. Mens\u00e4b\u00e4k is the god of rain and is therefore very important to the Lacand\u00f3n. Mens\u00e4b\u00e4k can be traced back to the pre-Hispanic Maya god Yum Chac, who is also a god associated with rainfall. There are also gods associated with thunder and lightning (Hahanak'uh), earthquakes (Kisin), and war and disease (Ak K'ak'). Inexplicably, the Lacandon seem to have no maize deity, a deity which is present among all other Mayan groups.<ref name=\"Mc1\"/>\n\nMore recently, \u00c4kyantho', the god of foreigners, has become more prominent. This god, \u00c4kyantho', is described as a light-skinned god that wears a hat and carries a pistol. \u00c4kyantho' is responsible for trade, medicine, diseases, some animals (horses for example), and metal tools. He has a son named Hesuklistos (Jesus Christ) who is supposed to be the god of the foreigners. This is expressive of the Lacand\u00f3n cultural conservancy and adaptability, in that they fit new gods into their world view. They recognize that Hesuklistos is a god but do not feel he is worthy of worship as he is a minor god.<ref name=\"Mc1\"/>\n\n===Ceremonial buildings, sacred places, and objects of ritual practice===\nMost Lacandon villages have a God House where ceremonies take place. Some are located near the religious leaders abode or close to the home of a well-respected or elderly male. Some villages hide the God House away from the village in the jungle so that outsiders are unable to find them. Often these sites are also guarded and even shielded with vegetation so that the rituals performed inside cannot be seen. The God House is built very low to the ground so that it is hard to see into and it is oriented to North, South, East, and West with the entrance on the east side where it faces toward Maya ruins and the sunrise. Inside the God House are the necessities used for various ceremonies. These include drums suspended in the ceiling so they don\u2019t touch the ground until they are needed for ritual song and dance; a fire starter traditionally consisting of a fire drill (two sticks) and more recently a lighter, matches or flint; benches to sit around; ceramic bowls for preparing and eating ritual meals or offerings; a conch shell \u201ctrumpet\u201d to announce the beginning of a ceremony for both villagers and the gods; a large hollowed trough to make the alcohol [[Balch\u00e9]] for ritual consumption; and most importantly the God House contains rubber characters, incense nodules (made of [[copal]]), and ceramic God pots used to burn the offerings for the rituals. Sacred places included caves (where the sun went to the underworld each night), Maya ruins where the Gods had once resided, next to rivers, rock outcroppings or particular places in the jungle (there would not be any cutting of vegetation in these areas). These places are often remote, secret, and not to be viewed by outsiders.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nGod pots are small ceramic bowls that have the head and face of the deity they represent attached to the rim of the pot, often with the head tilted back so that incense or offerings may be placed directly on it. These pots are fired in the open and coated with a mixture of clay, lime, and water and then painted with red or black dyes. The pots have specific masculine or feminine designs including whether the head had straight (male) or braided (female) hair and whether the pot was striped (male) or checked (female). In addition, pots used for rituals are considered to be alive and to have a soul. To bring life to a God pot the Lacand\u00f3n would use small pebbles they found at Maya ruins that they considered sacred. They would also use cacao beans for the purpose of giving the pot a \u201cheart\u201d. Each God pot was made for a particular deity or ritual and if they remained in good condition they sometimes were given from father to son. When a god pot became full with incense, burnt offerings, or was broken, there would be a renewal ceremony to replace it. The old pot would be taken to a sacred place and left and then new ceramic incense burners and figurines were made (usually to be discarded later) as they created a new pot to take the place of the old.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\n===Offerings, rituals, and beliefs===\nOfferings burnt in the God pots included incense, food, and rubber figurines. The food was often thought to sustain the Gods and keep order in the universe. The figurines were made of sap from the [[Castilla elastica]] tree, which was seen as blood from the tree and is thought to represent the blood sacrifices in some of the Lacandon ceremonies. These figurines were usually in the form of humans with specific body parts clearly represented but at times were also in the form of animals. Part of the belief of the Lacand\u00f3n entailed the Gods being able to partake in the offerings in the God pot by the figurine being burned in the God pot and becoming a messenger for the particular God invoked. The smoke of the offering was seen as the essence, or soul (pixan) which is consumable by the gods.<ref name=\"Did\">Boremanse, Didier (1993). The Faith of the Real People: The Lacandon of the Chiapas Rain Forest. New York, NY. The Crossroad Publishing Company.</ref> Ultimately, there is not a great understanding of the exact meaning of the anthropomorphic rubber figures though the symbolism appears to be representative of human sacrifice.<ref name=\"pal\" /> It is known that the rubber figures would be splattered with red [[annatto]] dye before being burnt and that at sometime before the 19th century it was common for the Lacand\u00f3n to participate in bloodletting where they would cut their earlobe or septum and smear the figurine with blood before burning it. The belief was that the God could be sustained from the smoke of the burning blood. Other beliefs, which signify a potential history of human sacrifice, include some Gods preferring human flesh and sacrificing other Gods and also that at the end of the world the Gods would sacrifice humans and would paint their houses with the blood of the humans. The behavior of the Gods being similar to that of humans may point toward cannibalism and human sacrifice among the Lacand\u00f3n historically though these practices were non-existent or unknown by the 20th century.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nOther practices may have included ancestor worship as god pots and incense burners have been found at burial sites. Reports of cremation burials (Baer and Baer, 1952) exist as well as ritual links to astronomy and dream interpretation. Not much is known about these practices.<ref name=\"pal\" /> A specific belief regarding the god Akyantho\u2019 is that he had first given the Lacand\u00f3n tools, medicine, animals, liquor, and other trade associated items but then took them away and gave them to foreigners because they were taking better care of these items. As a punishment for their irresponsibility, the Lacand\u00f3n had to interact with the foreigners in order to obtain what they needed.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In addition, the Lacand\u00f3n believed that their Gods had once dwelled in the ruins along with their ancestors. Many rituals were performed at these sites as evidenced by the numerous god pots found throughout. Breaking any of the rocks or damaging the buildings of the ruins was seen as disrespecting the Gods.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> Often these places were guarded but the increasing interruption of ceremonies along with the damaging of the sites and the god pots there forced the Lacand\u00f3n back into the jungles to perform their rituals privately.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Didier Boremanse, in the book ''South and Meso-American Native Spirituality'', gives some detailed accounts of specific rituals that he witnessed (pp.&nbsp;324\u2013351).<ref name=\"Did\" />\n\n==External influences==\nWhile the Lacand\u00f3n have recently seen an influx of outside influence with the coming of roads, logging, tourism, and other modernizations, it is important to recognize that they have had contact with outsiders throughout their history. It should also be noted that the Lacand\u00f3n were often the initiators of contact with foreigners (including other Mayan groups). Outside contact was usually facilitated by trade and religious conversion.<ref name=\"pal\" /> If we examine photographs and drawings of the Lacand\u00f3n dating from the late 19th century, we can see that their clothing and personal adornments have changed considerably. These valuable historical images show that cultural change has been taking place among the Lacand\u00f3n for a long time.\n\nThe Lacand\u00f3n have sometimes gone into nearby towns to participate in Catholic mass or other rituals performed by priests. The ritual of baptism was of particular interest, possibly because they perceived a cleansing and therapeutic value for that ritual.<ref name=\"pal\" /> Initially, attempts by [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|capuchin]] priests and other missionaries to Christianize the Lacand\u00f3n were unsuccessful. The priests repeatedly tried to emphasize the importance of monogamy in their religion, which may have led to the initial general non-acceptance of the religion. Polygyny was seen by the male Lacand\u00f3n as a way to ensure labor and economic power, retain ritual knowledge in food preparation, and maintain fertility among wives at different times.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> The Christian religion provided somewhat of a break for Lacand\u00f3n women because there was no need for the exhaustive process and knowledge base of preparing ritual foods for ceremonies. Because of this, and their exclusion from the traditional ceremonies other than cooking, many Lacand\u00f3n women asked their husbands to convert to Christianity.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the geographic differences among the Lacand\u00f3n may have influenced the rate at which Christian conversion occurred. It is noted that the lowland Lacand\u00f3n have all but abandoned the historical religion while those in the highlands still practice some traditional rituals. The need for privacy for the rites to be performed and outsider interruption likely has something to do with this as well.<ref name=\"pal\" /> The use of music and dance has also decreased in ritual behavior inexplicably since ethnographers began studying the Lacand\u00f3n. Today, it is possible to buy god pots made by the Lacand\u00f3n specifically for tourists. These pots are not painted and have not been given \u201csouls\u201d and therefore are not alive and can be sold.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> Jon McGee (2002) notes that increased participation in a monetary economy because of tourists has decreased the need for subsistence agriculture and with it the religious rites associated with agriculture.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> Other changes include the simplification of god pot designs, the non-existence of once very important pilgrimages to particular sites (because they have been desecrated), disappearance of bloodletting, and rarity of polygyny. Besides the influence of outsiders, these changes can also be attributed to deaths of the elders and knowledgeable persons who practiced the rituals through old age and often disease. Information was not passed on to younger generations, which opened a place for Christian missionaries to convert more Lacand\u00f3n. For this reason Protestantism is the dominant religion of the lowland Lacand\u00f3n today. John McGee (2002) has noted that within four years of the introduction of television, traditional ritual practices among the highland Lacand\u00f3n has been reduced to just two families and one individual. Many others no longer participate in any religion at this point.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\n==Economy==\nThe historic Lacand\u00f3n were neither strictly hunter-gatherers nor swidden agriculturalists, but rather, they were both as they saw fit. Likewise, they were at one time either mobile or sedentary.<ref name=\"pal\" /> The Lacand\u00f3n would make clearings in the forest to raise crops and some livestock, but they would also hunt and fish, and gather roots and plants in the jungle. As such, they had no need for a structured economy, as they relied on their own homesteads as their source of sustenance. The more contact that the Lacand\u00f3n had with other people, the more their economy morphed.\n\nThe historic Lacand\u00f3n would at times trade with outsiders, but there is little to no documentation regarding this contact. What trade was documented showed that it was the most contact the Lacand\u00f3n had with the outside world at the time. They traded animals, honey, bee\u2019s wax, tobacco, cotton, and cacao for much-needed metal tools. As time progressed into the 19th and 20h centuries, the goods the Lacand\u00f3n were given during trade became more advanced, such as firearms, kerosene, coffee, sugar, and clothing among other things.<ref name=\"pal\" /> There is evidence that showed that some Lacand\u00f3n kept regular trade with ranches in Chiapas, and through contact learned languages such as Spanish, [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]], and [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]] Maya. This allowed the Lacand\u00f3n to more easily understand [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal Maya]] culture and Christianity.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nTo the Lacand\u00f3n, trade with foreigners was the most vital, and once only way for them to come into contact with the outside world, and for them to obtain things that they themselves cannot produce. Throughout time one can see the advancement of technology reaching the Lacand\u00f3n. The increased trade in the 19th century also influenced change in the Lacand\u00f3n subsistence. They started raising chickens, cultivating oranges, plantains, sugar cane, and instead of hunting with bows and arrows, were hunting with rifles.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nSome Lacand\u00f3n would gain employment from [[wikt:Ladino|Ladinos]] in logging camps, and others would receive payment from logging camps for rights to log in their jungle. By the end of the 19th century and beginning of the twentieth, tourists would come to the Lacand\u00f3n villages and purchase material items like gourd bowls, bows, and arrowheads.\n\nAs other indigenous people were given land in the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle, the common practice of subsistence farming was replaced by semi commercial agriculture of the new people that were given land in the area. This was further influenced by the national government\u2019s encouragement of the development of commercial farming, and not the typical [[slash and burn]] practices that were historically common in the area.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In addition to that, rapid deforestation of the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle due to cattle grazing led the Lacand\u00f3n to move from their dispersed settlements to more centralized communities, thus shifting their economic practices.<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In the early 1970s, oil developments in [[Tabasco]] put money into Chiapas, and allowed for the Mexican government to set up a Rain forest reserve, preventing areas of the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle from being used by logging companies. However, after gaining control of the local extension of the Florida-based logging company Weiss Fricker Mahogany Company, the Mexican government organization Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA), which controlled the revenue generated by logging in the Lacand\u00f3n Jungle. A state-controlled company, the Compa\u00f1ia Forestal de la Lacandon S.A., was created to contract Lacand\u00f3n communities for logging rights of their land. Unfortunately, NAFINSA controlled most of the royalties made by the company, 70%, as opposed to the 30% that the Lacand\u00f3n communities received.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\nFollowing the oil price crash in the early 1980s, the value of the peso dropped dramatically, which made international tourism even more attractive. Though this affected the economy of the Lacand\u00f3n adversely, it presented an opportunity for them to gain. Lacand\u00f3n men would dedicate a good amount of their free time towards manufacturing arts and crafts, and then selling their goods to tourists in the larger towns in Chiapas, like [[Palenque]].<ref name=\"Mc1\" /> In 1980, a road was built to connect Palenque with the Lacand\u00f3n community of Nah\u00e1. This allowed tourist traffic to flow into Lacand\u00f3n communities, and the Lacand\u00f3n merchant selling material goods no longer had to travel for days, but rather set up his shop along the road, and could carry more items with the advent of vehicular travel in the area.\n\nOne of the biggest items sold to tourists are hunting kits - bows and arrows. Men making these bows and arrows transitioned from acquiring the materials from the jungle themselves, to just buying the materials and focused strictly on the production of the bows and arrows. These are usually sold at the Maya ruins at Palenque and range in sizes - from full adult sizes to child-sized toys kits.<ref name=\"Mc1\" />\n\nThe historical Lacand\u00f3n needed to rely on only themselves. But as they came into contact with other people, and Mexico became a more unified state, their economy shifted towards a more dependent one, thriving on increased trade with other local people and eventually were introduced with international trade.\n\n==Geography and land use==\nThe Lacand\u00f3n became associated as being isolated from other groups, a fact which was facilitated largely by the geographical setting in which they lived. The geography led many to be discouraged from venturing into the Lacand\u00f3n lands, and the result was that the Lacand\u00f3n people were never completely \u201cconquered\u201d as was the case with other indigenous groups in [[Mesoamerica]]. The rugged terrain and thick forests which characterize the Lacand\u00f3n lands in the eastern sector of the present-day Mexican state of [[Chiapas]] (see map at<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />) acted somewhat as a barrier to social interaction outside of the small and dispersed groups in which the Lacand\u00f3n lived from pre-Conquest times up to the 20th century.<ref name=\"pal\">Palka, Joel W. Unconquered Lacandon Maya. Gainesville, Fl: University Press of Florida, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe [[southern Maya lowlands]] which are home to the Lacand\u00f3n are characterized by rugged karstic topography and sub-tropical rainforest, known as the [[Selva Lacandona]], or the Lacandon Forest. Several rivers feed into the eastern Chiapas region, such as the [[Pasion River|Pasi\u00f3n]], [[San Pedro River (Guatemala)|San Pedro Martir]], [[Lacant\u00fan River|Lacant\u00fan]], [[Jatat\u00e9 River|Jatat\u00e9]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[Chixoy River|Chixoy]]. The rivers, along with many lakes, swamps and shorelines, contribute to the diversity of the Lacand\u00f3n lands. The availability of various types of flora and fauna which inhabit these aquatic and terrestrial areas have allowed the Lacand\u00f3n to thrive in a geographical setting which at first glance appears to be hostile to humans. In order to take full advantage of their resources, the Lacand\u00f3n have used specific agricultural, hunting and gathering techniques which have been designed to be conservative of the land and ecozone as a whole, which allows for sustainable use and therefore continued yield in the future. 20% of the approximately 700 Lacand\u00f3n people living today continue to use such techniques.<ref name=\"na1\">Nations, James D. \u201cThe Evolutionary Potential of Lacandon Maya Sustained-yield Tropical Forest Agriculture.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 36.1 (1980): 1-30.</ref>\n\nJames Nations recognizes four zones which the Lacand\u00f3n utilize to maintain a diverse food supply and healthy diet. The primary or old growth forest consists of small portions of tropical rain forest and lower mountainous rain forest, which constitutes the majority of the forest ecosystem.<ref name=\"na1\" /> While the growth in this type of rainforest is not quite as tall as that seen in a tropical rainforest, the two largely share the same characteristics (see interactive map at<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://elistas.egrupos.net/lista/encuentrohumboldt/archivo/indice/1442/msg/1484/cid/009701c5e539$94fd9330$0100000a@humboldt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723112723/http://elistas.egrupos.net/lista/encuentrohumboldt/archivo/indice/1442/msg/1484/cid/009701c5e539$94fd9330$0100000a@humboldt |archive-date=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and map at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiapaspictures.com/albums/userpics/normal_selva~0.jpg|format=JPG|title=Map of Lacandon : Photogrphic image|website=Chiapaspictures.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>). The primary growth forest provides hunting for the Lacand\u00f3n, as deer, [[peccary]], [[agouti]], and monkeys inhabit the area.<ref name=\"na1\" /> The Lacand\u00f3n also utilize the many different plant species in the rainforest for various purposes, including dietary and medicinal; the medicinal use of plants is well-developed amongst the Lacand\u00f3n and is important in their culture.<ref>Kashanipour, Ryan Amir and R. Jon McGee. \u201cNorthern Lacandon Maya Medicinal Plant Use in the Communities of Lacanja Chan Sayab and Naha\u2019, Chiapas, Mexico.\u201d Journal of Ecological Anthropology 8 (2004): 47-59.</ref> This zone is also very important for the maintenance of rich and stable soil, of which the Lacand\u00f3n take advantage in their [[milpa]] systems, the second zone.\n\nThe milpa, or farmed field, is crucial to the survival of the Lacand\u00f3n people. Here, they utilize sustainable [[slash and burn]] techniques to ensure the continued richness of the soils of the milpa and health of the region in general. The Lacand\u00f3n people engage in swidden agriculture on a primary or secondary growth forest in January, February or March, and allow the remains to dry until April. During this time, fire breaks are also put into place so as to keep the coming burn from catching other parts of the forest on fire. The firing occurs in April and planting begins soon thereafter. Different crops are grown together in the milpa amongst each other, such that plants of a single crop are separated from one another and surrounded by different crops. Also, tree species (bananas, plantains, etc.) are interspersed amongst maize and vine plants such as squash and chiles,<ref name=\"pal\" /> and root crops are cultivated in the ground under these. Plants are harvested in November or December after the rainy season which begins in May or June.<ref name=\"na1\" /> This cycle will be repeated for 2 to 5 years, at which time the milpa will be replanted with trees and allowed to be repopulated with wild forest plant species (this zone is then referred to as an [[acahual]]). After 5 to 7 years, the land will be used as a milpa again. After this second period of time used as a milpa, however, the land will be replanted with trees and allowed to develop into a mature secondary forest (at least 20 years), at which time it will be used as a milpa again.<ref name=\"na1\" />\n\nThe third zone, as mentioned above, is the acahual. The Lacand\u00f3n farmers replant the milpa in tree crops such as rubber or fruit and reap the direct benefits from the plants. The Lacand\u00f3n also use the acahual as a type of hunting ground, as the animals discussed above frequent the acahaul to graze or eat.<ref name=\"na1\" />\n\nThe last major zone in the Lacand\u00f3n lands is that which is near water, such as river banks, stream beds, swamps, and shorelines. The aquatic areas provide the Lacand\u00f3n with additional sources of protein and a different nutrient base from that which is provided by the terrestrial zones. The people use a specific type of snail species (''[[Pachychilus]]'' spp.) known locally as t\u2019unu as a type of protein supplement to their diet.<ref name=\"na2\">Nations, James D. \u201cSnail Shells and Maize Preparation: A Lacandon Maya Analogy.\u201d American Antiquity 44.3 (1979): 568-571.</ref> In addition, the shells from this organism provide great nutritional value, as they provide calcium and lime when burned. The lime is then added to maize to release amino acids such as tryptophan and lysine and the vitamin niacin, which would otherwise be unavailable from the maize (unable to be metabolized) if the lime were not added.<ref name=\"na2\" />\n\nBy utilizing the primary forest, milpas, acahuales and aquatic areas, the Lacand\u00f3n have been able to provide a healthy diet for themselves which has contributed to their ongoing survival.\n\n[[Image:Lacanj\u00e1ByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|A small dugout canoe in the Lacand\u00f3n village of Lacanj\u00e1 in 2001.]]\n\n==Archaeology==\nThree sites have been excavated and yielded artifacts that are historically Lacand\u00f3n, El Caobal, Matamangos and El Magal. The location of these abandoned Lacand\u00f3n sites have been passed down through generations of fathers taking their sons to the sites for hunting or exploring. The locals who had traveled there as children are the last informants who know the location of the Lacand\u00f3n settlements. Since the Lacand\u00f3n did not typically build \u201cstone-and-earth\u201d platforms it is almost impossible to find their lost settlements, making the knowledge of the elder locals crucial.\n\nEach site yielded different artifacts, some proved evidence of a home or residences, others may have been manufacturing sites. All show strong evidence of Lacand\u00f3n inhabitance. The easiest characteristic of Lacand\u00f3n settlement to spot is the presence of non-native vegetation such as fruit trees. Another being traditional Lacand\u00f3n pottery. The ceramic vessels found at all of the sites were dark brown and black with dark clouding on both the inside and outside and had a hemispherical shape. The hemispherical shape mimicked the familiar shape of the gourd vessels that were also very important. The gourds had a practical form and were used often for ritual food and drink. The rims of the ceramic vessels were squared off, as if they had been cut with a knife before being fired. Unlike Lacand\u00f3n gourd bowls, which were typically decorated with carved designs, the ceramic vessels had no designs or adornments. This might have shown some insight as to why they were left behind, perhaps they were so simple and easily produced that they were left behind and new vessels were made after the tribe migrated to a new location.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nThe first site discovered near the ruins of [[Dos Pilas]] was El Caobal, located on raised terrain and surrounded by swamp. In Spanish, caobal means \u201cplace or abundance of mahogany trees,\u201d this refers to the large concentration of them which most likely due to planting by the Lacand\u00f3n who relied on them for canoes and also because mahogany trees are not indigenous. El Caobal also has a large amount of mango and banana trees, which are also non-native, which were planted by the Lacand\u00f3n as a source of food. Beneath the jungle floor laid hundreds of artifacts including pottery, stone tools, metal pots and broken glass to name a few. Some of the artifacts were brought up by root action or a metal detector located and others were found from blind digs. The abundance of artifacts suggests the location a home or possibly a discard zone. The local artifacts that were found included utilitarian ceramics and stone tools, imported items consisted of white earthenware vessels with painted designs, glass bottles and metal tools.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nAt Matamangos, the site approximately one kilometer from El Caobal is identified by its abundance of mango trees (again showing that non-indigenous vegetation points to settlement). Matamangos was also on slightly raised ground and was located near a small group of Maya house mounds. After deciding to dig near one of the largest mango trees large amounts of [[chert]] debris such as chert cores, [[arrowheads]] and small blades were uncovered, another object that is characteristically Lacand\u00f3n. Chert was a hard stone that the Lacand\u00f3n used to make arrowheads and other [[Stone tool|lithic]] tools. A large piece of chert (also called a core) would first be heated and then bone is struck with a round [[hammerstone]] (made of volcanic rock) against the core, using indirect percussion fragments were chipped off to make prismatic chert blades. A hammerstone (probably imported from the Guatemalan highlands) was also found nearby the chert fragments. The stone was identified as being a hammerstone because of its smooth and rounded from use and fits comfortably in the hand and has scratches and chips from use. The uncovering of these related artifacts suggests possibly a tool manufacturing area or a discard site.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\nKnown as El Mangal or \u201cplace of many mango trees\u201d by the locals, this site has trees that were much larger than those at Caobal or Matamangos. The area also had a lagoon that was known on regional maps as \u201cEl Mangal\u201d (showing a knowledge of the area by people other than the locals). The water in the lagoon is not good for drinking or cooking but it useful for washing and catching fish. A current family has made residence at El Mangal and has unearthed a whole machete, they also found pieces of thick, hard, brown pottery (traditional Lacand\u00f3n ceramic). While digging a trash pit the family found more pottery, although it was not the traditional smooth bowls that had been found at El Caobal, they were still ethnographically Lacand\u00f3n. The vessels were identified as incense burners. The shape was hemispherical with a ring base and a hole for venting the fire and releasing smoke. Unlike the smooth ceramics used for every day life these vessels were adorned with the modeled head of a deity on the rim, proving this object is used for religious rites. The modeled heads \u201cclosely resemble those made by the ethnographic Lacandon.\u201d Other decorations include incised lines and holes down the front of the bowl and protruding spikes. These vessels were used in \u201cGod houses\u201d for religious purposes. During the Lacand\u00f3n incense burner renewal ceremony men isolated themselves from the community and crafted the burners in solitude. They were placed in the god house and the old burners were deposited at a sacred place in the forest. The presence of these incense burners points possibly to a religious god house, a manufacturing site or even a sacred place of disposal.<ref name=\"pal\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chiapas conflict]]\n* [[Kejache]]\n* [[Lakandon Ch'ol]]\n* [[Maya civilization]]\n* [[List of Mayan languages]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*A\u00edda, Rosalva, Hern\u00e1ndez, Castillo (2001).

They had previously moved there after living all their lives in Summer Bay. Matt is described as having a dislike for city life, so he soon moved back to the town.  Matt also tried to work in the Bayside Diner, but his love of the sea meant that he could not stick with it.<ref name=character>[[#refnicholls|Kesta and Nicholls 1992]], p.13.</ref> In the ''Home and Away Annual'', Kesta Desmond said that Matt is the serial's \"hunky beach boy\" who wears a permanent tan.

Benson told a writer from ''[[Look-in]]'' that he was often \"too lazy\" to change his socks because he did not think the audience would notice.<ref name=lazy/> He also had a similar attitude towards Matt's watch because it was \"always stuck on 9:30\" and visible to viewers; preferring his own as it was in working order. His actions resulted in him getting into trouble with the producers, who insisted he should wear his character's clothing.<ref name=lazy/>\n\nMatt went on to be one of the serial's \"major pulling powers\" because of the \"hunk\" categorisation the producers were determined to keep the character in the series as long as possible. The thought of being ''Home and Away''{{'}}s \"sex symbol\" made Benson cringe because he decided that the label was more associated with Hollywood actors.<ref>[[#refjclayden|J Clayden 1989]], p.34.</ref> Benson lived about an hours away by car from the ''Home and Away'' studios. He said he chose to drive to work instead of taking the quickest travel option of a train to avoid the many female fans of Matt.

Kesta Desmond wrote in the serial's authorised annual that despite the fact they are good friends, \"their personalities are quite different\".<ref name=character/> Adam is characterised as a \"a bit of a layabout\",<ref>[[#refnicholls|Kesta and Nicholls 1992]], p.55.</ref> while Matt has \"a very responsible attitude to finance and work matters, always turning up for work on time and paying his rent when it is due.\"<ref name=character/> Stevenson told a writer from ''Look-in'' that he and Benson were best friends and would also \"joke around\" on set.

With no explanation offered, even [[Lynne McGranger]] who plays [[Irene Roberts (Home and Away)|Irene Roberts]] in the serial said it was one of ''Home and Away's'' mysteries. In 2008, she told ''[[TV Week]]'' that she wonders \"where Greg Benson got to, his character Matt went into the kitchen to make a burger and was never seen again.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Behind the scenes|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=19\u201325 January 2008|pages=13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\nMatt is first seen when [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]), [[Lynn Davenport]] (Helena Bozich) and [[Sally Fletcher|Sally Keating]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) are exploring [[Summer Bay]], with Carly in particular being immediately taken by him. In order to get his attention, Carly follows [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson's]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]) advice and pretends to drown, only to nearly end up drowning for real. Matt is in Carly's year at school and it is partly because she is trying to impress him that Carly feels embarrassed that her foster father [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom Fletcher]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) is working with the road gang, unaware Matt's father is a garbage collector. Matt and Carly are cast as the leads in the school play, an experience that Carly, who had been raped not long before, finds uncomfortable. Matt has to leave Summer Bay when his family move away but he returns a few months later to take Carly to the school formal. The pair move to the city together but a few weeks later Matt returns to town and tells Carly's foster brother [[Steven Matheson]] ([[Adam Willits]]) that Carly has moved out of their flat and is hanging around with a bad crowd and drinking.\n\nMatt tries to support Carly when she tries to kick her alcohol addiction but no longer has feelings for her. He hangs around with [[Roo Stewart]] ([[Justine Clarke]]) to avoid her and then dates former school bad girl [[Alison Patterson]] (Kathryn Ridley), even though he does not like her. When Alison reveals to a journalist that [[Morag Bellingham]] ([[Cornelia Frances]]) is Bobby's mother, Matt breaks up with her to show her what it is like to be treated badly. He dates Carly again, thinking her family are going to move to London and the relationship will end naturally, but when she offers to stay in the Bay with him, he decides end their relationship. Matt takes a job working for Bobby and [[Ailsa Stewart]] ([[Judy Nunn]]) at the new Diner. When [[Celia Stewart]] ([[Fiona Spence]]) tries to set up a counselling service in the back room, Matt joins Steven and [[Dodge (Home and Away)|Brian 'Dodge' Forbes]] (Kelly Dingwall) in playing tricks on her by pretending he is in love with an older woman and describing Celia herself. He later applies for a job as a life saver and finds himself in competition with Adam. There is initially some ill-feeling when Matt secures the job but he and Adam sort it out and end up sharing a flat.\n\nSome years earlier, Matt's elder brother Shane had been shot and killed. [[Al Simpson (Home and Away)|Al Simpson]] ([[Terence Donovan (actor)|Terence Donovan]]), Bobby's adopted father, returns to town and tries to blackmail [[Donald Fisher (Home and Away)|Donald Fisher]] ([[Norman Coburn]]), who believes he accidentally shot Shane while hunting and has kept quiet ever since. Instead Donald turns himself in, at which point he discovers his gun was not the one that killed Shane. Matt and Bobby manage to expose Al as the real murderer.\n\nMatt and Adam begin renting the beach house and invite [[Marilyn Chambers (Home and Away)|Marilyn Chambers]] ([[Emily Symons]]) to move in with them. Matt's stay at the house is beset by problems, including crooked landlord [[Ernie Jacobs]] ([[David Weatherley]]) repeatedly trying to evict them and Adam and Marilyn's on-off romance, which sees them asking Matt to decide which of them would have to move out. When a botched DIY job by Adam leaves Matt trapped in the bathroom for hours, he moves into [[Grant Mitchell (Home and Away)|Grant Mitchell]]'s ([[Craig McLachlan]]) flat. Matt and Adam play a joke on [[Blake Dean (Home and Away)|Blake Dean]] ([[Les Hill]]) when he asks to join the surf club by setting him up with a punishing training regime that leaves him exhausted. Grant decides to tell Blake the truth. Matt and Steven are later responsible for working out that Grant's sister [[Kim Mitchell (Home and Away)|Kim]] ([[Rachael Beck]]) is a drug addict.\n\nIn late 1991, Adam tries to arrange for some of his friends to go on a surfing trip. [[Josh Webb (Home and Away)|Josh Webb]] (Erick Mitsak) plans to use the trip to get Adam and Blake alone, so lets the handbrake off Matt's car, causing it to damage another vehicle and leaving Matt, whose insurance had expired, having to pay for the damage to both cars and unable to afford the trip. Matt is not seen again until 2002, when he returns for Summer Bay's sesquicentenary celebrations.

He grew up in Summer Bay and now divides his time between chasing girls and chasing waves. Matt is an enthusiastic surfer and has managed to combine his love for the sea with his job as the local beach inspector.|4=''Kesta Desmond on Matt''.<ref name=character/>}}\n\nMatt initially moved to the city to live with his parents. They had previously moved there after living all their lives in Summer Bay. Matt is described as having a dislike for city life, so he soon moved back to the town.  Matt also tried to work in the Bayside Diner, but his love of the sea meant that he could not stick with it.<ref name=character>[[#refnicholls|Kesta and Nicholls 1992]], p.13.</ref> In the ''Home and Away Annual'', Kesta Desmond said that Matt is the serial's \"hunky beach boy\" who wears a permanent tan. Matt is also \"most at home\" when he is on a surf board.<ref>[[#refdesmond|Desmond 1990]], p.11.</ref> Matt is a confident character, Benson said that Matt is \"well sure of himself\".<ref>[[#refdesmond|Desmond 1990]], p.55.</ref> As Matt is a keen surfer, the role worked well for Benson who grew up on the coast and learned to surf.<ref>[[#refhopwood|Hopwood 1990]], p.34.</ref>\n\nProducers chose what Matt's attire would consist of; including socks and a wrist watch. Benson told a writer from ''[[Look-in]]'' that he was often \"too lazy\" to change his socks because he did not think the audience would notice.<ref name=lazy/> He also had a similar attitude towards Matt's watch because it was \"always stuck on 9:30\" and visible to viewers; preferring his own as it was in working order. His actions resulted in him getting into trouble with the producers, who insisted he should wear his character's clothing.<ref name=lazy/>\n\nMatt went on to be one of the serial's \"major pulling powers\" because of the \"hunk\" categorisation the producers were determined to keep the character in the series as long as possible. The thought of being ''Home and Away'''s \"sex symbol\" made Benson cringe because he decided that the label was more associated with Hollywood actors.<ref>[[#refjclayden|J Clayden 1989]], p.34.</ref> Benson lived about an hours away by car from the ''Home and Away'' studios. He said he chose to drive to work instead of taking the quickest travel option of a train to avoid the many female fans of Matt. Benson said \"It's quite embarrassing when you're not used to it\".<ref name=thirty>[[#refjclayden|J Clayden 1989]], p.37.</ref> After the producers renewed Benson's contract he admitted that he wanted to see Matt to have more character development.<ref name=thirty/>\n\nMatt is later paired with fellow character [[Adam Cameron]] ([[Mat Stevenson]]), who fills the role of his best friend. Kesta Desmond wrote in the serial's authorised annual that despite the fact they are good friends, \"their personalities are quite different\".<ref name=character/> Adam is characterised as a \"a bit of a layabout\",<ref>[[#refnicholls|Kesta and Nicholls 1992]], p.55.</ref> while Matt has \"a very responsible attitude to finance and work matters, always turning up for work on time and paying his rent when it is due.\"<ref name=character/> Stevenson told a writer from ''Look-in'' that he and Benson were best friends and would also \"joke around\" on set. During filming, Stevenson handed Benson a cup of coffee with a cockroach in it and ruined the scene when Benson could not stop laughing.<ref name=lazy>{{cite journal|title=Summer Bay watch|journal=[[Look-in]]|date=13 October 1990|issue=41|pages=15|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>\n\nAn [[urban legend]] among fans claimed that Matt disappeared from the series after walking into a cupboard, when in fact his last scene has him examining the damage to his car after it has rolled back into a stationary vehicle. With no explanation offered, even [[Lynne McGranger]] who plays [[Irene Roberts (Home and Away)|Irene Roberts]] in the serial said it was one of ''Home and Away's'' mysteries. In 2008, she told ''[[TV Week]]'' that she wonders \"where Greg Benson got to, his character Matt went into the kitchen to make a burger and was never seen again.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Behind the scenes|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=19\u201325 January 2008|pages=13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\nMatt is first seen when [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]), [[Lynn Davenport]] (Helena Bozich) and [[Sally Fletcher|Sally Keating]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) are exploring [[Summer Bay]], with Carly in particular being immediately taken by him. In order to get his attention, Carly follows [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson's]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]) advice and pretends to drown, only to nearly end up drowning for real. Matt is in Carly's year at school and it is partly because she is trying to impress him that Carly feels embarrassed that her foster father [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom Fletcher]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) is working with the road gang, unaware Matt's father is a garbage collector. Matt and Carly are cast as the leads in the school play, an experience that Carly, who had been raped not long before, finds uncomfortable. Matt has to leave Summer Bay when his family move away but he returns a few months later to take Carly to the school formal. The pair move to the city together but a few weeks later Matt returns to town and tells Carly's foster brother [[Steven Matheson]] ([[Adam Willits]]) that Carly has moved out of their flat and is hanging around with a bad crowd and drinking.\n\nMatt tries to support Carly when she tries to kick her alcohol addiction but no longer has feelings for her. He hangs around with [[Roo Stewart]] ([[Justine Clarke]]) to avoid her and then dates former school bad girl [[Alison Patterson]] (Kathryn Ridley), even though he does not like her. When Alison reveals to a journalist that [[Morag Bellingham]] ([[Cornelia Frances]]) is Bobby's mother, Matt breaks up with her to show her what it is like to be treated badly. He dates Carly again, thinking her family are going to move to London and the relationship will end naturally, but when she offers to stay in the Bay with him, he decides end their relationship. Matt takes a job working for Bobby and [[Ailsa Stewart]] ([[Judy Nunn]]) at the new Diner. When [[Celia Stewart]] ([[Fiona Spence]]) tries to set up a counselling service in the back room, Matt joins Steven and [[Dodge (Home and Away)|Brian 'Dodge' Forbes]] (Kelly Dingwall) in playing tricks on her by pretending he is in love with an older woman and describing Celia herself. He later applies for a job as a life saver and finds himself in competition with Adam. There is initially some ill-feeling when Matt secures the job but he and Adam sort it out and end up sharing a flat.\n\nSome years earlier, Matt's elder brother Shane had been shot and killed. [[Al Simpson (Home and Away)|Al Simpson]] ([[Terence Donovan (actor)|Terence Donovan]]), Bobby's adopted father, returns to town and tries to blackmail [[Donald Fisher (Home and Away)|Donald Fisher]] ([[Norman Coburn]]), who believes he accidentally shot Shane while hunting and has kept quiet ever since. Instead Donald turns himself in, at which point he discovers his gun was not the one that killed Shane. Matt and Bobby manage to expose Al as the real murderer.\n\nMatt and Adam begin renting the beach house and invite [[Marilyn Chambers (Home and Away)|Marilyn Chambers]] ([[Emily Symons]]) to move in with them. Matt's stay at the house is beset by problems, including crooked landlord [[Ernie Jacobs]] ([[David Weatherley]]) repeatedly trying to evict them and Adam and Marilyn's on-off romance, which sees them asking Matt to decide which of them would have to move out. When a botched DIY job by Adam leaves Matt trapped in the bathroom for hours, he moves into [[Grant Mitchell (Home and Away)|Grant Mitchell]]'s ([[Craig McLachlan]]) flat. Matt and Adam play a joke on [[Blake Dean (Home and Away)|Blake Dean]] ([[Les Hill]]) when he asks to join the surf club by setting him up with a punishing training regime that leaves him exhausted. Grant decides to tell Blake the truth. Matt and Steven are later responsible for working out that Grant's sister [[Kim Mitchell (Home and Away)|Kim]] ([[Rachael Beck]]) is a drug addict.\n\nIn late 1991, Adam tries to arrange for some of his friends to go on a surfing trip. [[Josh Webb (Home and Away)|Josh Webb]] (Erick Mitsak) plans to use the trip to get Adam and Blake alone, so lets the handbrake off Matt's car, causing it to damage another vehicle and leaving Matt, whose insurance had expired, having to pay for the damage to both cars and unable to afford the trip. Matt is not seen again until 2002, when he returns for Summer Bay's sesquicentenary celebrations. Even though they are both now married to other people, he is Carly's date for the celebratory boat cruise. When the boat capsises, they are quickly rescued and Matt joins the hunt for the missing passengers and crew.

They are heavily used in many microbiology-related industries and fields to culture various micro-organisms and are meant to be a more efficient method for detection and enumeration compared to conventional plating techniques.  A majority of its use is for the testing of foodstuffs.\n\nPetrifilm plates are designed to be as accurate as conventional plating methods.  Ingredients usually vary from plate to plate depending on what micro-organism is being cultured, but generally a Petrifilm comprises a cold-water-soluble gelling agent, nutrients, and indicators for activity and enumeration.\n\nA typical Petrifilm plate has a 10&nbsp;cm(H) \u00d7 7.5&nbsp;cm(W) bottom film which contains a foam barrier accommodating the plating surface, the plating surface itself (a circular area of about 20&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>), and a top film which encloses the sample within the Petrifilm.  A 1&nbsp;cm \u00d7 1&nbsp;cm yellow grid is printed on the back of the plate to assist enumeration.  A plastic \u201cspreader\u201d is also used to spread the inoculum evenly.\n\n== Comparisons between Petrifilm plates and standard methods ==\n[[Image:Petrifilm new.JPG|thumb|left|250 px|E. Coli/Coliform Petrifilms]]\n\nPetrifilm plates have become widely used because of their cost-effectiveness, simplicity, convenience, and ease of use.  For example, conventional plating would require preparing agar for pour plating, or using agar plates and vial inoculum loops for streak plating; but for Petrifilm plates, the agar is completely housed in a single unit so that only the sample has to be added, which saves time.\n\nFor incubation, Petrifilm plates can be safely stacked and incubated just like Petri dishes.  Since they are paper thin, more plates can be stacked together than Petri dishes (although 3M recommends that Petrifilms be stacked no higher than 20).  \nFor enumeration, Petrifilm plates can be used on any colony counter for enumeration just like a Petri dish.  Various enumeration experiments have shown very little or no variance between counts obtained through Petrifilm and standard agar counts.<ref>Nero, L.A., Beloti, V., Barros, M.D.F., Ortolani, M.B.T., Tamanini, R. & Franco, B.D.G.D.M.

The top film is then slowly rolled down and the \u201cspreader\u201d is used for even distribution.  It takes a minute for gelling to occur.\n\n== After incubation ==\n[[File:Petrifilm plate with coliform colonies.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|EC Petrifilm which has tested positive for coliforms]]\nAfter the required incubation period, colonies appear either as splotches, spots which are surrounded by bubbles, or a combination of both, which differ from micro-organism to micro-organism.  Enumeration can be done on a standard colony counter.  Picking out individual colonies for interpretation can also be done because the top film can be lifted quite effortlessly to expose the gel.  Unfortunately, if a sample is too dark in colour (e.g. chocolate or hot chocolate), enumeration becomes more difficult or impossible, since the stained colonies are less visible.\n[[Image:PositiveZoomed.JPG|thumb|250 px|Individual coliform colony from previous picture]]\n\n== Types of Petrifilm plates ==\n* [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic plate count]]\n* [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic plate count]] with [[lactic acid bacteria]]\n* [[Lactic acid bacteria]]\n* [[Coliform]]\n* Rapid [[coliform]]\n* High-Sensitivity [[coliform]]\n* ''[[E. coli]]'' / [[coliform]]\n* [[Enterobacteriaceae]]\n* [[Staphylococcus]] express\n* [[Yeast]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mould]]\n* Environmental [[listeria]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Microbiology/FoodSafety/products/petrifilm-plates/ Official 3M Petrifilm Plates Product Listings (from 3M Microbiology)]\n* [http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Microbiology/FoodSafety/ 3M Microbiology (United States)]\n* [http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_WW/microbiology-worldwide/home/?WT.mc_id=www.3m.com/microbiology 3M Microbiology (Worldwide)]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Agar plate]]\n* [[Agar]]\n* [[Petri dish]]\n* [[3M|The 3M Company]]\n\n{{3M}}\n{{Laboratory equipment}}\n\n[[Category:Microbiology terms]]\n[[Category:Microbiology equipment]]\n[[Category:3M brands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox laboratory equipment\n|name         = 3M Petrifilm Plates\n|image        = Inoculate.JPG\n|alt          = <!-- See Wikipedia:Alternative text for images -->\n|caption      = Inoculating the Petrifilm\n|acronym      = \n|other_names   = \n|uses         = [[Microbiological culture|Culturing]]\n|inventor     = \n|manufacturer = [[3M|The 3M Company]]\n|model        = 3M Petrifilm\n|related      = [[Agar plate]]<br/>[[Petri dish]]\n}}\nThe 3M '''Petrifilm''' plate is an all-in-one plating system made by the Food Safety Division of the [[3M|3M Company]].

The ships formerly served in the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong#Royal Navy|Hong Kong Squadron]] as {{sclass-|Peacock|patrol vessel|1}}s until 1997.\n\nThe three vessels have undergone weapons, electronics, propulsion and hull upgrades in Philippine Navy service, increasing their capabilities as compared to the original ''Peacock'' class vessels.\n\n==History==\nLaunched as a series of five patrol vessels, the {{sclass-|Peacock|patrol vessel|4}} were originally part of the Hong Kong Squadron of the  [[Royal Navy]]. The ships were built by [[Hall, Russell & Company|Hall Russell]] in the United Kingdom and were commissioned into Royal Navy service from 1983 to 1984. The class was designed specifically for patrol duties in [[Hong Kong]] waters. As well as \"flying the flag\" and providing a constant British naval presence in the region, they could also undertake a number of different roles including [[seamanship]], [[navigation]] and [[Naval artillery|gunnery]] training. In addition, they performed [[Search and rescue|search-and-rescue]] duties for which they had facilities to carry divers (including a decompression chamber) and equipment to recover vessels and aircraft. They also worked with the Marine Department of the [[Hong Kong Police]] and with Customs & Excise in order to prevent the constant flow of illegal immigrants, narcotics and electronic equipment into the Colony.<ref>''Royal Navy Postwar.

Meanwhile the BRP ''Apolinario Mabini'' (PS-36) and BRP ''Artemio Ricarte'' (PS-37) do not have a CMS although both ships use a Fire Control System from [[Ultra Electronics]].\n\nThe [[Oto Melara 76 mm]] Compact DP (Dual Purpose) gun is the primary weapon and is mounted in a [[gun turret|turret]] forward of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. It has a range of up to {{convert|10|nmi|km|-1}} and can be used against ships, aircraft or ground targets. It is remotely controlled from within the [[Combat Information Center]] by the gunnery officer and has no crew within the turret itself. The gun can fire 80 [[Shell (projectile)|rounds]] in 60 seconds from its ready [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]], and the ships can carry a total of 450 rounds.\n\nThe secondary weapon (located at the stern) is a [[M242 Bushmaster]] 25&nbsp;mm cannon in an MSI Defense System DS-25 Seahawk A1 mount.\n\nBoth guns are automated and are integrated with the Saab 9LV CMS and Saab EOS-500 Electro-optical tracking system (EOTS) on PS-35, or the Ultra Electronics C2 and FCS, and Series 1700 EOTS on PS-36 and PS-37.\n\nThe Saab EOS-500 and Ultra Electronics Series 1700 EOTS replaced the Radamec 1500 Series 2500 installed by the PN in 2005, which is turn replaced the older GSA7 Sea Archer Mk 1 electro-optical director with a GEC V3800 thermal imager added in 1987.<ref name=\"CFW15\"/><ref name=\"WNWS5\">{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Norman |title=The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapons System |edition=5th |pages=307 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC |isbn=9781557502629 |access-date=2017-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424135915/https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC |archive-date=2018-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the abovementioned guns, these ships also carry two 12.7&nbsp;mm 50 caliber heavy machine guns at the bridgewings, two 20&nbsp;mm Mark 16 guns on Mk.68 mounts at midships, and two 50&nbsp;mm rocket flare projectors.<ref name=\"CFW15\"/>\n\nThe ships are powered by two APE-[[Crossley]] [[SEMT-Pielstick]] diesels (14,188&nbsp;bhp combined) driving two three-bladed [[propeller]]s.

The ships formerly served in the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong#Royal Navy|Hong Kong Squadron]] as {{sclass-|Peacock|patrol vessel|1}}s until 1997.\n\nThe three vessels have undergone weapons, electronics, propulsion and hull upgrades in Philippine Navy service, increasing their capabilities as compared to the original ''Peacock'' class vessels.\n\n==History==\nLaunched as a series of five patrol vessels, the {{sclass-|Peacock|patrol vessel|4}} were originally part of the Hong Kong Squadron of the  [[Royal Navy]]. The ships were built by [[Hall, Russell & Company|Hall Russell]] in the United Kingdom and were commissioned into Royal Navy service from 1983 to 1984. The class was designed specifically for patrol duties in [[Hong Kong]] waters. As well as \"flying the flag\" and providing a constant British naval presence in the region, they could also undertake a number of different roles including [[seamanship]], [[navigation]] and [[Naval artillery|gunnery]] training. In addition, they performed [[Search and rescue|search-and-rescue]] duties for which they had facilities to carry divers (including a decompression chamber) and equipment to recover vessels and aircraft. They also worked with the Marine Department of the [[Hong Kong Police]] and with Customs & Excise in order to prevent the constant flow of illegal immigrants, narcotics and electronic equipment into the Colony.<ref>''Royal Navy Postwar.

Meanwhile the BRP ''Apolinario Mabini'' (PS-36) and BRP ''Artemio Ricarte'' (PS-37) do not have a CMS although both ships use a Fire Control System from [[Ultra Electronics]].\n\nThe [[Oto Melara 76 mm]] Compact DP (Dual Purpose) gun is the primary weapon and is mounted in a [[gun turret|turret]] forward of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. It has a range of up to {{convert|10|nmi|km|-1}} and can be used against ships, aircraft or ground targets. It is remotely controlled from within the [[Combat Information Center]] by the gunnery officer and has no crew within the turret itself. The gun can fire 80 [[Shell (projectile)|rounds]] in 60 seconds from its ready [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]], and the ships can carry a total of 450 rounds.\n\nThe secondary weapon (located at the stern) is a [[M242 Bushmaster]] 25&nbsp;mm cannon in an MSI Defense System DS-25 Seahawk A1 mount.\n\nBoth guns are automated and are integrated with the Saab 9LV CMS and Saab EOS-500 Electro-optical tracking system (EOTS) on PS-35, or the Ultra Electronics C2 and FCS, and Series 1700 EOTS on PS-36 and PS-37.\n\nThe Saab EOS-500 and Ultra Electronics Series 1700 EOTS replaced the Radamec 1500 Series 2500 installed by the PN in 2005, which is turn replaced the older GSA7 Sea Archer Mk 1 electro-optical director with a GEC V3800 thermal imager added in 1987.<ref name=\"CFW15\"/><ref name=\"WNWS5\">{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Norman |title=The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapons System |edition=5th |pages=307 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC |isbn=9781557502629 |access-date=2017-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424135915/https://books.google.com/books?id=4S3h8j_NEmkC |archive-date=2018-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the abovementioned guns, these ships also carry two 12.7&nbsp;mm 50 caliber heavy machine guns at the bridgewings, two 20&nbsp;mm Mark 16 guns on Mk.68 mounts at midships, and two 50&nbsp;mm rocket flare projectors.<ref name=\"CFW15\"/>\n\nThe ships are powered by two APE-[[Crossley]] [[SEMT-Pielstick]] diesels (14,188&nbsp;bhp combined) driving two three-bladed [[propeller]]s.
