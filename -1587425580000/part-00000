Corden had previously appeared as Fred's ''singing'' voice in the theatrical film ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966) and the television specials ''[[Alice in Wonderland or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?]]'' (1966) and ''[[Energy: A National Issue]]'' (1977).

The opening title sequence was a composite, using clips from the openings of the various series, along with a new title theme song. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained an inferior [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track created by the studio]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Henry Corden]] as [[Fred Flintstone]] (Host), [[The Hillbilly Bears|Paw Rugg]], Dr. Bigot (''Yogi's Gang'')\n* [[Josh Albee]] as Freddy, Jimmy (''Yogi's Gang'')\n* [[Sherry Alberoni]] as Laurie Partridge (''The Partridge Family in Outer Space'')\n* [[Julie Bennett]] as [[Cindy Bear]] (''Yogi's Gang'')\n* [[Joe Besser]] as Babu (''Jeannie'')\n* [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Barney Rubble]], [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]], Zonk, Stub (''The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show'', ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour'')\n* [[Danny Bonaduce]] as Danny Partridge (''Goober and the Ghost Chasers'', ''The Partridge Family in Outer Space'')\n* [[Tom Bosley]] as Commadore Phineas P.

The series was packaged by Columbia Pictures Television during the 1977\u201378 television season and was available for barter syndication through [[Claster Television]] through the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Sobel\">Sobel, Robert (1977). \"Syndicated kidvid lively; top dollar for cartoons\" ''Television/Radio Age'', Vol. 25, No. 2.

Corden had previously appeared as Fred's ''singing'' voice in the theatrical film ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966) and the television specials ''[[Alice in Wonderland or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?]]'' (1966) and ''[[Energy: A National Issue]]'' (1977). He continued providing Fred's voice in future ''Flintstones'' spin-off series and specials, as well as [[Pebbles cereal|Cocoa Pebbles and Fruity Pebbles]] cereal commercials, until his death in 2005.\n\n==Overview==\nThe series is hosted by [[Fred Flintstone]] and featured a repackaging of the following six Hanna-Barbera [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning cartoons]] that were originally broadcast by the various networks:\n\n*''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'' (1972\u20131974) (\"Fred and Barney\" and \"The Bedrock Rockers\" segments)\n*''[[Goober and the Ghost Chasers]]'' (1973\u20131975)\n*''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'' (1973\u20131975)\n*''[[Partridge Family 2200 A.D.]]'' (1974\u20131975) (re-titled ''The Partridge Family in Outer Space'')\n*''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]'' (1971\u20131972)\n*''[[Yogi's Gang]]'' (1973)\n\nThe six series were repackaged from their original half-hour formats into multi-part [[Serial (radio and television)|serialized]] segments which were introduced by Fred on a daily basis (via [[voice-over]]s on brief bumper clips shown in-between segments). The opening title sequence was a composite, using clips from the openings of the various series, along with a new title theme song. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained an inferior [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track created by the studio]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Henry Corden]] as [[Fred Flintstone]] (Host), [[The Hillbilly Bears|Paw Rugg]], Dr. Bigot (''Yogi's Gang'')\n* [[Josh Albee]] as Freddy, Jimmy (''Yogi's Gang'')\n* [[Sherry Alberoni]] as Laurie Partridge (''The Partridge Family in Outer Space'')\n* [[Julie Bennett]] as [[Cindy Bear]] (''Yogi's Gang'')\n* [[Joe Besser]] as Babu (''Jeannie'')\n* [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Barney Rubble]], [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]], Zonk, Stub (''The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show'', ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour'')\n* [[Danny Bonaduce]] as Danny Partridge (''Goober and the Ghost Chasers'', ''The Partridge Family in Outer Space'')\n* [[Tom Bosley]] as Commadore Phineas P.
