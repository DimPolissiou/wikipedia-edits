Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer, to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. \nThe charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the [[state of charge]], and cut off at the end of charge.\n\nA trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging of any kind;  attempts to do so may result in damage.  Lithium ion battery cells use a chemistry system which does not permit indefinite trickle charging.<ref>Phil Weicker, ''A Systems Approach to Lithium-Ion Battery Management'',Artech House, 2013 {{ISBN|1608076598}} page 26 </ref>\n\nSlow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.\n\n==C-rate==\n{{see also|Battery (electricity)#C rate}}\nCharge and discharge rates are often given as ''C'' or ''C-rate'', which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. The C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is [[hour|h]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, equivalent to stating the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.\n\nFor example, for a battery with a capacity of 500&nbsp;mAh, a discharge rate of 5000&nbsp;mA (i.e., 5&nbsp;A) corresponds to a C-rate of 10 (per hour), meaning that such a current can discharge 10 such batteries in one hour. Likewise, for the same battery a charge current of 250&nbsp;mA corresponds to a C-rate of 1/2 (per hour), meaning that this current will increase the state of charge of this battery by 50% in one hour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |title= A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications MIT Electric Vehicle Team  |website= [[mit.edu|web.mit.edu]] |date= December 2008 |accessdate= May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the unit of the C-rate is typically implied, some care is required when using it to avoid confusing it with the battery's capacity to store a charge, which in the [[International System of Units|SI]] has unit [[coulomb]] with unit symbol ''C''.\n\nIf both the (dis)charge current and the battery capacity in the C-rate ratio is multiplied by the battery voltage, the C-rate becomes a ratio of the (dis)charge power to the battery's energy capacity. For example, when the 100&nbsp;kWh battery in a [[Tesla Model S]] P100D is undergoing [[Tesla supercharger|supercharging]] at 120&nbsp;kW the C-rate is 1.2 (per hour) and when that battery delivers its maximum power of 451&nbsp;kW, its C-rate is 4.51 (per hour).\n\nAll charging and discharging of batteries generates internal heat, and the amount of heat generated is roughly proportional to the current involved (a battery's current state of charge, condition / history, etc. are also factors).  As some batteries reach their full charge, cooling may also be observed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva557/snva557.pdf| format=[[PDF]] |title=LM2576,LM3420,LP2951,LP2952 Battery Charging |website= [[ti.com|www.ti.com]] [date=July 2018 |accessdate= July 29, 2018}}</ref> Battery cells which have been built to allow higher C-rates than usual must make provision for increased heating. But high C-ratings are attractive to end users because such batteries can be charged more quickly, and produce higher current output in use.  High C-rates typically require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and so damage to the cells. Such high charging rates are possible only with some battery types. Others will be damaged or possibly overheat or catch fire. Some batteries may even explode. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For example, an automobile SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) lead-acid battery carries [[Lead\u2013acid battery#Risk of explosion|several risks of explosion]].\n\n==Type==\n\n===Simple charger===\n\nA simple charger works by supplying a [[direct current|constant DC]] or [[pulsed DC]] [[electric power|power]] source to a battery being charged. A simple charger typically does not alter its output based on charging time or the charge on the battery. This simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive, but there are tradeoffs. Typically, a carefully designed simple charger takes longer to charge a battery because it is set to use a lower (i.e., safer) charging rate. Even so, many batteries left on a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging. These chargers also vary in that they can supply either a constant voltage or a constant current, to the battery.\n\nSimple AC-powered battery chargers usually have much higher [[ripple (electrical)|ripple current and ripple voltage]] than other kinds of battery chargers because they are inexpensively designed and built.  Generally, when the ripple current is within a battery's manufacturer recommended level, the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level.  The maximum ripple current for a typical 12{{nbsp}}V 100{{nbsp}}Ah [[VRLA battery]] is 5 amps. As long as the ripple current is not excessive (more than 3 to 4 times the battery manufacturer recommended level), the expected life of a ripple-charged VRLA battery will be within 3% of the life of a constant DC-charged battery.<ref>\n[http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Effects%20of%20AC%20Ripple%20Current%20on%20VRLA%20Battery%20Life.pdf \"Effects of AC Ripple Current on VRLA Battery Life\"]\nby Emerson Network Power\n</ref>\n\n===Fast charger===\nFast chargers make use of control circuitry to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging any of the cells in the battery. The control circuitry can be built into the battery (generally for each cell) or in the external charging unit, or split between both. Most such chargers have a [[cooling fan]] to help keep the temperature of the cells at safe levels. Most fast chargers are also capable of acting as standard overnight chargers if used with standard NiMH cells that do not have the special control circuitry.\n\n===Three stage charger===\nTo accelerate the charging time and provide continuous charging, an intelligent charger attempts to detect the state of charge and condition of the battery and applies a 3-stage charging scheme. The following description assumes a sealed lead acid traction battery at 25{{nbsp}}\u00b0C. The first stage is referred to as \"bulk absorption\";  the charging current will be held high and constant and is limited by the capacity of the charger. When the voltage on the battery reaches its outgassing voltage (2.22 volts per cell) the charger switches to the second stage and the voltage is held constant (2.40 volts per cell). The delivered current will decline at the maintained voltage, and when the current reaches less than 0.005C the charger enters its third stage and the charger output will be held constant at 2.25 volts per cell. In the third stage, the charging current is very small 0.005C and at this voltage the battery can be maintained at full charge and compensate for self-discharge.\n\n===Induction-powered charger===\n{{Main|Inductive charging}}\n\nInductive battery chargers use [[electromagnetic induction]] to charge batteries. A charging station sends electromagnetic energy through [[inductive coupling]] to an electrical device, which stores the energy in the batteries. This is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery. Inductive battery chargers are commonly used in [[electric toothbrush]]es and other devices used in bathrooms. Because there are no open electrical contacts, there is no risk of electrocution. Nowadays it is being used to charge wireless phones.\n\n===Intelligent charger===\n[[Image:Ladeger\u00e4t.jpg|thumb|right| Example of a smart charger for AA and AAA batteries]]\nA \"smart charger\" should not be confused with a \"smart battery\". A [[smart battery]] is generally defined as one containing some sort of electronic device or \"chip\" that can communicate with a [[smart charger]] about battery characteristics and condition.  A smart battery generally requires a smart charger it can communicate with (see [[Smart Battery Data]]).  A smart charger is defined as a charger that can respond to the condition of a battery, and modify its charging actions accordingly.\n\nSome smart chargers are designed to charge:\n* \"smart\" batteries with internal protection or supervision or management circuitry.\n* \"dumb\" batteries, which lack any internal electronic circuitry.\n\nThe output current of a smart charger depends upon the battery's state. An intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage, temperature or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current and to terminate charging.\n\nFor [[nickel-cadmium battery|Ni-Cd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries, the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process, until the battery is fully charged. After that, the voltage ''decreases'', which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged. Such chargers are often labeled as a \u0394V, \"delta-V,\" or sometimes \"delta peak\", charger, indicating that they monitor the voltage change.\n\nThe problem is, the magnitude of \"delta-V\" can become very small or even non-existent if (very) high{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} capacity rechargeable batteries are recharged.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This can cause even an intelligent battery charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged, and to continue charging. Overcharging of the batteries will result in some cases. However, many so called intelligent chargers employ a combination of cut off systems, which are intended to prevent overcharging in the vast majority of cases.\n\nA typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour, then switches to trickle charging, which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/BATTS/BATTS.HTM |title=The Great Battery Shootout |author=Dave Etchells}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-powered charger===\n[[Image: Linear induction flashlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Linear induction flashlight, charged by shaking along its long axis, causing magnet ''(visible at right)'' to slide through a coil of wire ''(center)'' to generate electricity]]\nSeveral companies have begun making devices that charge batteries based on human motions.  One example, made by [[Tremont Electric]], consists of a magnet held between two springs that can charge a battery as the device is moved up and down, such as when walking.  Such products have not yet achieved significant commercial success.<ref>Martin LaMonica, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20076064-54/motion-powered-gadget-charger-back-on-track/?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Motion-powered gadget charger back on track].\" Jul 1, 2011.

The DC pulses have a strictly controlled [[rise time]], pulse width, pulse repetition rate ([[frequency]]) and [[amplitude]]. This technology is said to work with any size, voltage, capacity or chemistry of batteries, including automotive and [[VRLA|valve-regulated]] batteries.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/913/ |title=AN913: Switch-Mode, Linear, and Pulse Charging Techniques for Li+ Battery in Mobile Phones and PDAs |publisher=Maxim |year=2001}}\n</ref>\n\nWith pulse charging, high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery.  In a [[Lead\u2013acid battery]], this breaks down lead-sulfate crystals, thus greatly extending the battery service life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html  |title=Lead\u2013acid battery sulfation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402140958/http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html |archivedate = 2007-04-02}}</ref>\n\nSeveral kinds of pulse charging are patented.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2003088447 |title=\"fast pulse battery charger\" patent |year=2003}}\n</ref><ref>\n\"Battery charger with current pulse regulation\"\npatented 1981\nUnited States Patent 4355275\n</ref><ref>\n\"Pulse-charge battery charger\"\npatented 1997\nUnited States Patent 5633574\n</ref>  Others are [[open source hardware]].\n\nSome chargers use pulses to check the current battery state when the charger is first connected, then use constant current charging during fast charging, then use pulse charging as a kind of trickle charging to maintain the charge.<ref>[http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm \"Pulse Maintenance charging.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309020550/http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSome chargers use \"negative pulse charging\", also called \"reflex charging\" or \"burp charging\".\nSuch chargers use both positive and brief negative current pulses.  There is no significant evidence, however, that negative pulse charging is more effective than ordinary pulse charging.\n\n===Solar charger===\n{{main|Solar charger}}\n{{Further|Energy harvesting}}\n[[File:Solar-Charger Varta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Varta]] Solar Charger Model 57082 with two 2100{{nbsp}}mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries]]\nSolar chargers convert light energy into low voltage [[DC current]]. They are generally [[wikt:portable|portable]], but can also be fixed mount.  Fixed mount solar chargers are also known as [[solar panels]]. Solar panels are often connected to the electrical grid via control and interface circuits, whereas portable solar chargers are used off-the-grid (i.e. [[Automobile|cars]], [[boats]], or [[RVs]]).\n\nAlthough portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only, they still can (depending on the technology) be used in low light (i.e. cloudy) applications.  Portable solar chargers are often used for [[trickle charging]], although some solar chargers (depending on the [[wattage]]), can completely recharge batteries. Other devices may exist, which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy.\n\n===Timer-based charger===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe output of a [[timer]] charger is terminated after a pre-determined time. Timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity [[Ni-Cd]] cells in the late 1990s for example (low-capacity consumer Ni-Cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger).\n\nOften a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries. If batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged, and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged. With the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year, an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries.\n\nTimer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged, even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger, would result in over-charging.\n\n===Trickle charger===\n{{Main|Trickle charging}}\n\nA trickle charger is typically a low-current (usually between 5\u20131,500&nbsp;mA) battery charger or one which has a trickle charging operating mode. A trickle charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2\u201330&nbsp;Ah). These types of battery chargers are also used to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30&nbsp;Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current (trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers).  Depending on the technology of the trickle charger, it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are also referred to as smart or intelligent chargers.  Some battery types are not suitable for trickle charging. For instance, most Li-ion batteries cannot be safely trickle charged, and the damage caused can be enough to cause a fire or even an explosion.\n\n===Universal battery charger\u2013analyzer===\nThe most sophisticated types are used in critical applications (e.g. military or aviation batteries).  These heavy-duty automatic \u201cintelligent charging\u201d systems can be programmed with complex charging cycles specified by the battery maker.  The best are universal (i.e. can charge all battery types), and include automatic capacity testing and analyzing functions too.\n\n===USB-based charger===\n{{Off topic||Off topic|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File: Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket.jpg|thumb|Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket]]\n{{See also|USB#Power|ISO 4165}}\nSince the [[Universal Serial Bus]] specification provides for a five-volt power supply (with limited maximum power), it is possible to use a [[USB cable]] to connect a device to a power supply. Products based on this approach include chargers for [[cellular phone]]s, portable [[digital audio players]], and [[tablet computer]]s. They may be fully compliant USB peripheral devices adhering to USB power discipline, or uncontrolled in the manner of [[USB decoration]]s.\n\n====Power bank====\n\n[[Image:USB power bank.jpg|thumb|right|A power bank with USB cable.]]\n\nA power bank is a portable device that can supply power from its built-in battery through a USB port.  Power banks are popular for charging USB charged devices. They can also be used as a power supply for various USB powered devices such as lights and small fans. They usually recharge with a [[USB|USB power supply]].  The power bank includes a control circuit that both regulates charging of the battery and converts the battery voltage to 5.0 volts for the USB port. Some chargers for cells like 18650s and 26650 can also serve as a power bank.  Although it is generally more cumbersome to carry such a charger with cells rather than a conventional power bank, this arrangement can also charge cells for other uses, and swap cells that are dead.  It also has the advantage that, when the cells are dead, they can be swapped for fresh cells for immediate use rather than having to be recharged first.\n[[Image:Quintezz powerbank, opened.png|thumb|right|Many powerbanks use the common 18650 size [[lithium-ion battery]] which may be user-replaceable.]]\n\nSpecifications:\n* Capacity in Wh: Total power capacity measured by multiplying mAh by voltage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.powerbanktalk.com/best-power-banks/ |title=The Best USB Battery Packs}}</ref>\n* Capacity in mAh: [[mAh]] stands for milli Ampere-hour and measures the amount of power flow that can be supplied by a certain power bank at a specific voltage. Many manufacturers rate their products at 3.7 V, the voltage of cell(s) inside. Since USB outputs at 5 V, calculations at this voltage will yield a lower mAh number. For example, a battery pack advertised with a 3000 mAh capacity (at 3.7 V) will produce 2220 mAh at 5 V.  Power losses due to efficiency of the charging circuitry also occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/portable-power-bank-capacities-gary-explains-699550/ |title=Does a 3000 mAh portable power bank charge a 3000 mAh phone? |publisher=Android Authority |date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* Simultaneous charging and discharging (also known as ''\u201cpassthrough\u201d charging''<ref name=RAV_passthrough2>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2018/06/pass-through-creative-ways-power-banks-charge/ RavPower.com blog article: \u201cHow Pass Through Charging Lets You Use Power Banks In Creative Ways\u201d]</ref><ref name=RAV_passthrough>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2017/10/danger-and-damage-of-pass-through-technology-for-batteries/ RAVpower Blog article: \u201cWhat is Passthrough Charging?\u201d]</ref>): need to specify if the powerbank's ports can output power while it being charged itself.\n* Number of output [[USB]] ports: This specifies the number of devices that can be charged simultaneously.\n* Output current rating: This specifies the current rating that it can charge maximum. The higher the number, the better the powerbank. This can vary from output port to output port. Also, some powerbanks don't have dedicated high current ports, but will drop the output at all ports if the maximum total current output of the powerbank is exceeded.\n* Input Current Rating: Input current rating is the amount of current the powerbank is able to draw at its maximum level while getting charged.\n* Safety Protections: Over Voltage Protection, Over Charge Protection, Over Current Protection, Over Heat Protection, Short-Circuit Protections and Over Discharge Protections are the common safety measures observed with standard powerbanks.\n* [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] Indications: The Led glows as per indicating the amount of charging ability left with the powerbank. Some powerbanks have a line of LEDs, with the number of LEDs lit indicating state of charge. Other powerbanks may simply have one LED which changes color or flashes when the charge of the internal battery is low.\n* [[Quick charge]] (commonly [[Qualcomm Quick Charge]]) support?\n\nSome power banks have a built-in wireless charging pad. Power banks are available in different capacity ratings.\n\n====Compatibility====\n[[File:Mini, micro and J10 USB connectors.jpg|thumb|Mini, micro and J10 USB charging connectors]]\n[[File:Lightning connector.svg|thumb|Lightning connector]]\n[[File:USB charger with three different charging ports.png|thumb|Australian 240 V USB charger with three different types of charging ports]]\nAlthough a standard exists for USB chargers<ref>{{cite web |title=IEC - Newslog > 2011-02-01: One size-fits-all mobile phone charger: IEC publishes first globally relevant standard |url=http://www.iec.ch/newslog/2011/nr0311.htm |website=www.iec.ch |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>, there are two areas of common incompatibility.\n* The connector on the device to be charged. There are several current and many obsolete connectors, including:\n**The [[Micro USB]] connector\n**The [[Mini USB]] connector\n**The [[USB-C]] connector\n**The [[lightning connector]]\n**The [[J10 connector]]\n**Various sizes of [[coaxial power connector]], particularly the smaller sizes\n**The [[3.5 mm jack]] and [[2.5 mm jack]]\n:and others. It is essential that the connectors on the device and charger match exactly, so that the correct polarity is used.  Reversing the polarity between a battery and its charger is likely to cause battery failure and even charger failure.  The failures may result in fire or damaged / destroyed equipment..\n* The charging port. This may be smart or dumb, and each in various current ratings. Compatibility varies and must be checked to maximize safety . A mismatched charger will charge more slowly, and sometimes not at all.\n\n==Applications==\nSince a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery, it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the DC voltage output;  it is cheaper to make them that way. Battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering are sometimes termed [[battery eliminator]]s.\n\n===Battery charger for vehicles===\nThere are two main types of chargers used for vehicles:\n* To recharge a fuel vehicle's [[Car battery|starter battery]], where a modular charger is used; typically an [[IUoU battery charging|3-stage charger]].\n* To recharge an electric vehicle (EV) battery pack; see [[Charging station]].\n\nChargers for car batteries come in varying ratings. Chargers that are rated up to two amperes may be used to maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.\n\n=== Electric vehicle batteries===\n\nElectric vehicle battery chargers (ECS) come in a variety of brands and characteristics. These chargers vary from 1&nbsp;kW to 7.5&nbsp;kW maximum charge rate. Some use algorithm charge curves, others use constant voltage, constant current. Some are programmable by the end user through a [[Controller area network|CAN]] port, some have dials for maximum voltage and amperage, some are preset to specified battery pack voltage, amp-hour and chemistry. Prices range from $400 to $4500.\n\nA 10 amp-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity.\n\nPublic EV [[charging station]]s provide 6&nbsp;kW (host power of 208 to 240 VAC off a 40 amp circuit). 6&nbsp;kW will recharge an EV roughly 6 times faster than 1&nbsp;kW overnight charging.\n\nRapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is limited only by available AC power, battery type, and the type of charging system.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/09/fuji-heavy-spee.html Fuji Heavy Speeds Up Recharging of R1e EV].

These typically employ some form of inductive connection between the grid and a charging vehicle. Some isolated chargers may be used in parallel. This allows for an increased charge current and reduced charging times. The battery has a maximum current rating that cannot be exceeded\n* Non-isolated: the battery charger has a direct electrical connection to the A/C outlet's wiring. Non-isolated chargers cannot be used in parallel.\n\n[[Power Factor Correction]] (PFC) chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver, shortening charging time.\n\n====Charge stations====\n{{Main|Charging station}}\n\n[[Better Place (company)|Project Better Place]] was deploying a network of charging stations and subsidizing vehicle battery costs through [[leasing|leases]] and credits until filing for bankruptcy in May 2013.\n[[File:Charge6 3wACin.jpg|thumb|Auxiliary charger designed to fit a variety of proprietary devices]]\n\n====Induction-powered charging====\nResearchers at the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called [[Online Electric Vehicle]], OLEV)  where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via [[inductive charging]], (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself.<ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/ Korean electric vehicle solution].

A database-driven system is one solution, and is being incorporated into some designs of charging kiosks.\n\nThere are also human-powered chargers sold on the market, which typically consists of a [[dynamo]] powered by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and extension cords.

It can charge mobile phone 4 times faster than standard micro USB.\n\n===Stationary battery plants===\nTelecommunications, electric power, and computer [[uninterruptible power supply]] facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in [[battery room]]s) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within, say, 8 hours or other interval.\n\n===Use in experiments===\nA battery charger can work as a DC [[power adapter]] for experimentation. It may, however, require an external [[capacitor]] to be connected across its output terminals in order to \"smooth\" the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a \"[[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]]\" voltage added to it.  There may be an [[internal resistance]] connected to limit the short circuit current, and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments.\n\n==Prolonging battery life==\nWhich electrical practices, and so which charger, are best suited for use depending entirely on the type of battery. NiCd cells must be fully discharged occasionally, or else the battery loses capacity over time due to a phenomenon known as \"[[memory effect]].\" Once a month (perhaps once every 30 charges) is sometimes recommended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This extends the life of the battery since memory effect is prevented while avoiding full [[charge cycle]]s which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries, eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity.\n\nMost modern cell phones, laptops, and most electric vehicles use [[Lithium-ion]] batteries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2bFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Most+modern+cell+phones,+laptops,+and+most+electric+vehicles+use+Lithium-ion+batteries&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj16d2qiI7VAhUW92MKHVbkA7kQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Most%20modern%20cell%20phones,%20laptops,%20and%20most%20electric%20vehicles%20use%20Lithium-ion%20batteries&f=false|title=Energy: Sources, Utilization, Legislation, Sustainability, Illinois as Model State|last=Mansoori|first=G.

As with all battery types, degradation also occurs faster at higher temperatures. Degradation in [[lithium-ion]] batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance often due to cell [[oxidation]]. This decreases the efficiency of the battery, resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the battery. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, if Li-ION cells are discharged below a certain voltage a chemical reaction occurs that make them dangerous if recharged, which is why many such batteries in consumer goods now have an \"electronic fuse\" that permanently disables them if the voltage falls below a set level. The electronic fuse circuitry draws a small amount of current from the battery, which means that if a laptop battery is left for a long time without charging it, and with a very low initial [[state of charge]], the battery may be permanently destroyed.\n\nMotor vehicles, such as boats, RVs, ATVs, motorcycles, cars, trucks, etc. have used [[lead\u2013acid]] batteries. These batteries employ a [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]] and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting memory effect, though [[sulfation]] (a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead) will occur over time. Typically sulfated batteries are simply replaced with new batteries, and the old ones recycled. [[Lead\u2013acid]] batteries will experience substantially longer life when a maintenance charger is used to \"float charge\" the battery.  This prevents the battery from ever being below 100% charge, preventing sulfate from forming.  Proper temperature compensated [[float voltage]] should be used to achieve the best results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|Alternator]] \u2013 battery charging device in car\n* [[Electric bus#Charging]]\n* [[Battery eliminator]]\n* [[Battery management system]]\n* [[Charge controller]]\n* [[FuelRod]] \u2013 a kiosk-based charging service \n* [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n* [[Recharging alkaline batteries]]\n* [[Solar energy]]\n* [[Solar lamp]]\n* [[State of charge]] (batteries)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[https://mheal.in/ Battery charging problem solution]\n{{Commons category|Battery chargers|Battery charger}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battery Charger}}\n[[Category:Battery chargers| ]]\n[[Category:Battery charging]]\n[[Category:Rechargeable batteries]]\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|other senses of this term|AC adapter}}\n[[File:BatteryCharger1.jpg|thumb|upright|This unit charges the batteries until they reach a specific voltage and then it [[trickle charging|trickle charges]] the batteries until it is disconnected.]]\n[[File:Simple Charger.jpg|thumb|A simple charger equivalent to an AC/DC wall adapter.

Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer, to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. \nThe charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the [[state of charge]], and cut off at the end of charge.\n\nA trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging of any kind;  attempts to do so may result in damage.  Lithium ion battery cells use a chemistry system which does not permit indefinite trickle charging.<ref>Phil Weicker, ''A Systems Approach to Lithium-Ion Battery Management'',Artech House, 2013 {{ISBN|1608076598}} page 26 </ref>\n\nSlow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.\n\n==C-rate==\n{{see also|Battery (electricity)#C rate}}\nCharge and discharge rates are often given as ''C'' or ''C-rate'', which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. The C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is [[hour|h]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, equivalent to stating the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.\n\nFor example, for a battery with a capacity of 500&nbsp;mAh, a discharge rate of 5000&nbsp;mA (i.e., 5&nbsp;A) corresponds to a C-rate of 10 (per hour), meaning that such a current can discharge 10 such batteries in one hour. Likewise, for the same battery a charge current of 250&nbsp;mA corresponds to a C-rate of 1/2 (per hour), meaning that this current will increase the state of charge of this battery by 50% in one hour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |title= A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications MIT Electric Vehicle Team  |website= [[mit.edu|web.mit.edu]] |date= December 2008 |accessdate= May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the unit of the C-rate is typically implied, some care is required when using it to avoid confusing it with the battery's capacity to store a charge, which in the [[International System of Units|SI]] has unit [[coulomb]] with unit symbol ''C''.\n\nIf both the (dis)charge current and the battery capacity in the C-rate ratio is multiplied by the battery voltage, the C-rate becomes a ratio of the (dis)charge power to the battery's energy capacity. For example, when the 100&nbsp;kWh battery in a [[Tesla Model S]] P100D is undergoing [[Tesla supercharger|supercharging]] at 120&nbsp;kW the C-rate is 1.2 (per hour) and when that battery delivers its maximum power of 451&nbsp;kW, its C-rate is 4.51 (per hour).\n\nAll charging and discharging of batteries generates internal heat, and the amount of heat generated is roughly proportional to the current involved (a battery's current state of charge, condition / history, etc. are also factors).  As some batteries reach their full charge, cooling may also be observed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva557/snva557.pdf| format=[[PDF]] |title=LM2576,LM3420,LP2951,LP2952 Battery Charging |website= [[ti.com|www.ti.com]] [date=July 2018 |accessdate= July 29, 2018}}</ref> Battery cells which have been built to allow higher C-rates than usual must make provision for increased heating. But high C-ratings are attractive to end users because such batteries can be charged more quickly, and produce higher current output in use.  High C-rates typically require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and so damage to the cells. Such high charging rates are possible only with some battery types. Others will be damaged or possibly overheat or catch fire. Some batteries may even explode. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For example, an automobile SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) lead-acid battery carries [[Lead\u2013acid battery#Risk of explosion|several risks of explosion]].\n\n==Type==\n\n===Simple charger===\n\nA simple charger works by supplying a [[direct current|constant DC]] or [[pulsed DC]] [[electric power|power]] source to a battery being charged. A simple charger typically does not alter its output based on charging time or the charge on the battery. This simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive, but there are tradeoffs. Typically, a carefully designed simple charger takes longer to charge a battery because it is set to use a lower (i.e., safer) charging rate. Even so, many batteries left on a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging. These chargers also vary in that they can supply either a constant voltage or a constant current, to the battery.\n\nSimple AC-powered battery chargers usually have much higher [[ripple (electrical)|ripple current and ripple voltage]] than other kinds of battery chargers because they are inexpensively designed and built.  Generally, when the ripple current is within a battery's manufacturer recommended level, the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level.  The maximum ripple current for a typical 12{{nbsp}}V 100{{nbsp}}Ah [[VRLA battery]] is 5 amps. As long as the ripple current is not excessive (more than 3 to 4 times the battery manufacturer recommended level), the expected life of a ripple-charged VRLA battery will be within 3% of the life of a constant DC-charged battery.<ref>\n[http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Effects%20of%20AC%20Ripple%20Current%20on%20VRLA%20Battery%20Life.pdf \"Effects of AC Ripple Current on VRLA Battery Life\"]\nby Emerson Network Power\n</ref>\n\n===Fast charger===\nFast chargers make use of control circuitry to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging any of the cells in the battery. The control circuitry can be built into the battery (generally for each cell) or in the external charging unit, or split between both. Most such chargers have a [[cooling fan]] to help keep the temperature of the cells at safe levels. Most fast chargers are also capable of acting as standard overnight chargers if used with standard NiMH cells that do not have the special control circuitry.\n\n===Three stage charger===\nTo accelerate the charging time and provide continuous charging, an intelligent charger attempts to detect the state of charge and condition of the battery and applies a 3-stage charging scheme. The following description assumes a sealed lead acid traction battery at 25{{nbsp}}\u00b0C. The first stage is referred to as \"bulk absorption\";  the charging current will be held high and constant and is limited by the capacity of the charger. When the voltage on the battery reaches its outgassing voltage (2.22 volts per cell) the charger switches to the second stage and the voltage is held constant (2.40 volts per cell). The delivered current will decline at the maintained voltage, and when the current reaches less than 0.005C the charger enters its third stage and the charger output will be held constant at 2.25 volts per cell. In the third stage, the charging current is very small 0.005C and at this voltage the battery can be maintained at full charge and compensate for self-discharge.\n\n===Induction-powered charger===\n{{Main|Inductive charging}}\n\nInductive battery chargers use [[electromagnetic induction]] to charge batteries. A charging station sends electromagnetic energy through [[inductive coupling]] to an electrical device, which stores the energy in the batteries. This is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery. Inductive battery chargers are commonly used in [[electric toothbrush]]es and other devices used in bathrooms. Because there are no open electrical contacts, there is no risk of electrocution. Nowadays it is being used to charge wireless phones.\n\n===Intelligent charger===\n[[Image:Ladeger\u00e4t.jpg|thumb|right| Example of a smart charger for AA and AAA batteries]]\nA \"smart charger\" should not be confused with a \"smart battery\". A [[smart battery]] is generally defined as one containing some sort of electronic device or \"chip\" that can communicate with a [[smart charger]] about battery characteristics and condition.  A smart battery generally requires a smart charger it can communicate with (see [[Smart Battery Data]]).  A smart charger is defined as a charger that can respond to the condition of a battery, and modify its charging actions accordingly.\n\nSome smart chargers are designed to charge:\n* \"smart\" batteries with internal protection or supervision or management circuitry.\n* \"dumb\" batteries, which lack any internal electronic circuitry.\n\nThe output current of a smart charger depends upon the battery's state. An intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage, temperature or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current and to terminate charging.\n\nFor [[nickel-cadmium battery|Ni-Cd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries, the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process, until the battery is fully charged. After that, the voltage ''decreases'', which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged. Such chargers are often labeled as a \u0394V, \"delta-V,\" or sometimes \"delta peak\", charger, indicating that they monitor the voltage change.\n\nThe problem is, the magnitude of \"delta-V\" can become very small or even non-existent if (very) high{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} capacity rechargeable batteries are recharged.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This can cause even an intelligent battery charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged, and to continue charging. Overcharging of the batteries will result in some cases. However, many so called intelligent chargers employ a combination of cut off systems, which are intended to prevent overcharging in the vast majority of cases.\n\nA typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour, then switches to trickle charging, which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/BATTS/BATTS.HTM |title=The Great Battery Shootout |author=Dave Etchells}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-powered charger===\n[[Image: Linear induction flashlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Linear induction flashlight, charged by shaking along its long axis, causing magnet ''(visible at right)'' to slide through a coil of wire ''(center)'' to generate electricity]]\nSeveral companies have begun making devices that charge batteries based on human motions.  One example, made by [[Tremont Electric]], consists of a magnet held between two springs that can charge a battery as the device is moved up and down, such as when walking.  Such products have not yet achieved significant commercial success.<ref>Martin LaMonica, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20076064-54/motion-powered-gadget-charger-back-on-track/?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Motion-powered gadget charger back on track].\" Jul 1, 2011.

The DC pulses have a strictly controlled [[rise time]], pulse width, pulse repetition rate ([[frequency]]) and [[amplitude]]. This technology is said to work with any size, voltage, capacity or chemistry of batteries, including automotive and [[VRLA|valve-regulated]] batteries.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/913/ |title=AN913: Switch-Mode, Linear, and Pulse Charging Techniques for Li+ Battery in Mobile Phones and PDAs |publisher=Maxim |year=2001}}\n</ref>\n\nWith pulse charging, high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery.

There is no significant evidence, however, that negative pulse charging is more effective than ordinary pulse charging.\n\n===Solar charger===\n{{main|Solar charger}}\n{{Further|Energy harvesting}}\n[[File:Solar-Charger Varta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Varta]] Solar Charger Model 57082 with two 2100{{nbsp}}mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries]]\nSolar chargers convert light energy into low voltage [[DC current]]. They are generally [[wikt:portable|portable]], but can also be fixed mount.  Fixed mount solar chargers are also known as [[solar panels]]. Solar panels are often connected to the electrical grid via control and interface circuits, whereas portable solar chargers are used off-the-grid (i.e. [[Automobile|cars]], [[boats]], or [[RVs]]).\n\nAlthough portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only, they still can (depending on the technology) be used in low light (i.e. cloudy) applications.  Portable solar chargers are often used for [[trickle charging]], although some solar chargers (depending on the [[wattage]]), can completely recharge batteries. Other devices may exist, which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy.\n\n===Timer-based charger===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe output of a [[timer]] charger is terminated after a pre-determined time. Timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity [[Ni-Cd]] cells in the late 1990s for example (low-capacity consumer Ni-Cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger).\n\nOften a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries. If batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged, and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged. With the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year, an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries.\n\nTimer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged, even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger, would result in over-charging.\n\n===Trickle charger===\n{{Main|Trickle charging}}\n\nA trickle charger is typically a low-current (usually between 5\u20131,500&nbsp;mA) battery charger or one which has a trickle charging operating mode. A trickle charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2\u201330&nbsp;Ah). These types of battery chargers are also used to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30&nbsp;Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current (trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers).  Depending on the technology of the trickle charger, it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are also referred to as smart or intelligent chargers.  Some battery types are not suitable for trickle charging. For instance, most Li-ion batteries cannot be safely trickle charged, and the damage caused can be enough to cause a fire or even an explosion.\n\n===Universal battery charger\u2013analyzer===\nThe most sophisticated types are used in critical applications (e.g. military or aviation batteries).  These heavy-duty automatic \u201cintelligent charging\u201d systems can be programmed with complex charging cycles specified by the battery maker.  The best are universal (i.e. can charge all battery types), and include automatic capacity testing and analyzing functions too.\n\n===USB-based charger===\n{{Off topic||Off topic|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File: Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket.jpg|thumb|Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket]]\n{{See also|USB#Power|ISO 4165}}\nSince the [[Universal Serial Bus]] specification provides for a five-volt power supply (with limited maximum power), it is possible to use a [[USB cable]] to connect a device to a power supply. Products based on this approach include chargers for [[cellular phone]]s, portable [[digital audio players]], and [[tablet computer]]s. They may be fully compliant USB peripheral devices adhering to USB power discipline, or uncontrolled in the manner of [[USB decoration]]s.\n\n====Power bank====\n\n[[Image:USB power bank.jpg|thumb|right|A power bank with USB cable.]]\n\nA power bank is a portable device that can supply power from its built-in battery through a USB port.  Power banks are popular for charging USB charged devices. They can also be used as a power supply for various USB powered devices such as lights and small fans. They usually recharge with a [[USB|USB power supply]].  The power bank includes a control circuit that both regulates charging of the battery and converts the battery voltage to 5.0 volts for the USB port. Some chargers for cells like 18650s and 26650 can also serve as a power bank.  Although it is generally more cumbersome to carry such a charger with cells rather than a conventional power bank, this arrangement can also charge cells for other uses, and swap cells that are dead.  It also has the advantage that, when the cells are dead, they can be swapped for fresh cells for immediate use rather than having to be recharged first.\n[[Image:Quintezz powerbank, opened.png|thumb|right|Many powerbanks use the common 18650 size [[lithium-ion battery]] which may be user-replaceable.]]\n\nSpecifications:\n* Capacity in Wh: Total power capacity measured by multiplying mAh by voltage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.powerbanktalk.com/best-power-banks/ |title=The Best USB Battery Packs}}</ref>\n* Capacity in mAh: [[mAh]] stands for milli Ampere-hour and measures the amount of power flow that can be supplied by a certain power bank at a specific voltage. Many manufacturers rate their products at 3.7 V, the voltage of cell(s) inside. Since USB outputs at 5 V, calculations at this voltage will yield a lower mAh number. For example, a battery pack advertised with a 3000 mAh capacity (at 3.7 V) will produce 2220 mAh at 5 V.  Power losses due to efficiency of the charging circuitry also occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/portable-power-bank-capacities-gary-explains-699550/ |title=Does a 3000 mAh portable power bank charge a 3000 mAh phone? |publisher=Android Authority |date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* Simultaneous charging and discharging (also known as ''\u201cpassthrough\u201d charging''<ref name=RAV_passthrough2>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2018/06/pass-through-creative-ways-power-banks-charge/ RavPower.com blog article: \u201cHow Pass Through Charging Lets You Use Power Banks In Creative Ways\u201d]</ref><ref name=RAV_passthrough>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2017/10/danger-and-damage-of-pass-through-technology-for-batteries/ RAVpower Blog article: \u201cWhat is Passthrough Charging?\u201d]</ref>): need to specify if the powerbank's ports can output power while it being charged itself.\n* Number of output [[USB]] ports: This specifies the number of devices that can be charged simultaneously.\n* Output current rating: This specifies the current rating that it can charge maximum.

Power banks are available in different capacity ratings.\n\n====Compatibility====\n[[File:Mini, micro and J10 USB connectors.jpg|thumb|Mini, micro and J10 USB charging connectors]]\n[[File:Lightning connector.svg|thumb|Lightning connector]]\n[[File:USB charger with three different charging ports.png|thumb|Australian 240 V USB charger with three different types of charging ports]]\nAlthough a standard exists for USB chargers<ref>{{cite web |title=IEC - Newslog > 2011-02-01: One size-fits-all mobile phone charger: IEC publishes first globally relevant standard |url=http://www.iec.ch/newslog/2011/nr0311.htm |website=www.iec.ch |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>, there are two areas of common incompatibility.\n* The connector on the device to be charged. There are several current and many obsolete connectors, including:\n**The [[Micro USB]] connector\n**The [[Mini USB]] connector\n**The [[USB-C]] connector\n**The [[lightning connector]]\n**The [[J10 connector]]\n**Various sizes of [[coaxial power connector]], particularly the smaller sizes\n**The [[3.5 mm jack]] and [[2.5 mm jack]]\n:and others. It is essential that the connectors on the device and charger match exactly, so that the correct polarity is used.  Reversing the polarity between a battery and its charger is likely to cause battery failure and even charger failure.  The failures may result in fire or damaged / destroyed equipment..\n* The charging port. This may be smart or dumb, and each in various current ratings. Compatibility varies and must be checked to maximize safety . A mismatched charger will charge more slowly, and sometimes not at all.\n\n==Applications==\nSince a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery, it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the DC voltage output;  it is cheaper to make them that way. Battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering are sometimes termed [[battery eliminator]]s.\n\n===Battery charger for vehicles===\nThere are two main types of chargers used for vehicles:\n* To recharge a fuel vehicle's [[Car battery|starter battery]], where a modular charger is used; typically an [[IUoU battery charging|3-stage charger]].\n* To recharge an electric vehicle (EV) battery pack; see [[Charging station]].\n\nChargers for car batteries come in varying ratings. Chargers that are rated up to two amperes may be used to maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.\n\n=== Electric vehicle batteries===\n\nElectric vehicle battery chargers (ECS) come in a variety of brands and characteristics. These chargers vary from 1&nbsp;kW to 7.5&nbsp;kW maximum charge rate. Some use algorithm charge curves, others use constant voltage, constant current. Some are programmable by the end user through a [[Controller area network|CAN]] port, some have dials for maximum voltage and amperage, some are preset to specified battery pack voltage, amp-hour and chemistry. Prices range from $400 to $4500.\n\nA 10 amp-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity.\n\nPublic EV [[charging station]]s provide 6&nbsp;kW (host power of 208 to 240 VAC off a 40 amp circuit). 6&nbsp;kW will recharge an EV roughly 6 times faster than 1&nbsp;kW overnight charging.\n\nRapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is limited only by available AC power, battery type, and the type of charging system.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/09/fuji-heavy-spee.html Fuji Heavy Speeds Up Recharging of R1e EV]. Green Car Congress (2007-09-18). Retrieved on 2011-11-11.</ref>\n\nOnboard EV chargers (change AC power to DC power to recharge the EV's pack) can be:\n* Isolated: they make no physical connection between the [[Alternating current|A/C]] electrical [[mains electricity|mains]] and the batteries being charged. These typically employ some form of inductive connection between the grid and a charging vehicle. Some isolated chargers may be used in parallel. This allows for an increased charge current and reduced charging times. The battery has a maximum current rating that cannot be exceeded\n* Non-isolated: the battery charger has a direct electrical connection to the A/C outlet's wiring. Non-isolated chargers cannot be used in parallel.\n\n[[Power Factor Correction]] (PFC) chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver, shortening charging time.\n\n====Charge stations====\n{{Main|Charging station}}\n\n[[Better Place (company)|Project Better Place]] was deploying a network of charging stations and subsidizing vehicle battery costs through [[leasing|leases]] and credits until filing for bankruptcy in May 2013.\n[[File:Charge6 3wACin.jpg|thumb|Auxiliary charger designed to fit a variety of proprietary devices]]\n\n====Induction-powered charging====\nResearchers at the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called [[Online Electric Vehicle]], OLEV)  where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via [[inductive charging]], (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself.<ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/ Korean electric vehicle solution].

Older ones are notoriously diverse, having a wide variety of [[DC connector]]-styles and voltages, most of which are not compatible with other manufacturers' phones or even different models of phones from a single manufacturer.\n\nUsers of publicly accessible charging kiosks must be able to cross-reference connectors with device brands/models and individual charge parameters and thus ensure delivery of the correct charge for their mobile device. A database-driven system is one solution, and is being incorporated into some designs of charging kiosks.\n\nThere are also human-powered chargers sold on the market, which typically consists of a [[dynamo]] powered by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and extension cords. A French startup offers a kind of dynamo charger inspired by the [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] that can be used with only one hand.<ref>[http://www.todaysiphone.com/2013/06/charge-your-mobile-device-wherever-you-are-using-voltmaker/ Charge your iPhone by spinning Voltmaker around like a mini helicopter]. Today's iPhone. Retrieved on 2013-06-25.</ref> There are also [[solar power|solar]] chargers, including one that is a fully mobile personal charger and panel, which you can easily transport.\n\nChina, the European Commission and other countries are making a national standard on mobile phone chargers using the [[USB|USB standard]].<ref>[http://english.sina.com/1/2006/1203/96928.html China to work out national standard for mobile phone chargers]. English.sina.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-11.</ref>  In June 2009, 10 of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop specifications for and support a [[microUSB]]-equipped [[common External Power Supply]] (EPS) for all data-enabled mobile phones sold in the [[European Union|EU]].<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/167578/universal_chargers_are_a_good_start_5_more_things_that_need_conformity.html PC World:Universal Chargers are a Good Start] Jan 2009</ref>  On October 22, 2009, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] announced a standard for a universal charger for mobile handsets (Micro-USB).<ref>[http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2009/49.html Oct 22, 2009, ITU press release] Universal charger for mobile phone handsets</ref>\n\n[[Quick Charge]] was announce in 2012 and has more faster technology in 2016 using [[USB-C]] and [[USB Power Delivery|USB-PD]] connector. It can charge mobile phone 4 times faster than standard micro USB.\n\n===Stationary battery plants===\nTelecommunications, electric power, and computer [[uninterruptible power supply]] facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in [[battery room]]s) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within, say, 8 hours or other interval.\n\n===Use in experiments===\nA battery charger can work as a DC [[power adapter]] for experimentation. It may, however, require an external [[capacitor]] to be connected across its output terminals in order to \"smooth\" the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a \"[[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]]\" voltage added to it.  There may be an [[internal resistance]] connected to limit the short circuit current, and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments.\n\n==Prolonging battery life==\nWhich electrical practices, and so which charger, are best suited for use depending entirely on the type of battery. NiCd cells must be fully discharged occasionally, or else the battery loses capacity over time due to a phenomenon known as \"[[memory effect]].\" Once a month (perhaps once every 30 charges) is sometimes recommended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This extends the life of the battery since memory effect is prevented while avoiding full [[charge cycle]]s which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries, eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity.\n\nMost modern cell phones, laptops, and most electric vehicles use [[Lithium-ion]] batteries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2bFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Most+modern+cell+phones,+laptops,+and+most+electric+vehicles+use+Lithium-ion+batteries&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj16d2qiI7VAhUW92MKHVbkA7kQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Most%20modern%20cell%20phones,%20laptops,%20and%20most%20electric%20vehicles%20use%20Lithium-ion%20batteries&f=false|title=Energy: Sources, Utilization, Legislation, Sustainability, Illinois as Model State|last=Mansoori|first=G.

Barnie|date=2015-11-05|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814704021|language=en}}</ref>  These batteries last longest if the battery is frequently charged; fully discharging the cells will degrade their capacity relatively quickly, but most such batteries are used in equipment which can sense the approach of full discharge and discontinue equipment use.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} When stored after charging, lithium battery cells degrade more while fully charged than if they are only 40-50% charged. As with all battery types, degradation also occurs faster at higher temperatures. Degradation in [[lithium-ion]] batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance often due to cell [[oxidation]]. This decreases the efficiency of the battery, resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the battery. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, if Li-ION cells are discharged below a certain voltage a chemical reaction occurs that make them dangerous if recharged, which is why many such batteries in consumer goods now have an \"electronic fuse\" that permanently disables them if the voltage falls below a set level. The electronic fuse circuitry draws a small amount of current from the battery, which means that if a laptop battery is left for a long time without charging it, and with a very low initial [[state of charge]], the battery may be permanently destroyed.\n\nMotor vehicles, such as boats, RVs, ATVs, motorcycles, cars, trucks, etc. have used [[lead\u2013acid]] batteries. These batteries employ a [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]] and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting memory effect, though [[sulfation]] (a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead) will occur over time. Typically sulfated batteries are simply replaced with new batteries, and the old ones recycled. [[Lead\u2013acid]] batteries will experience substantially longer life when a maintenance charger is used to \"float charge\" the battery.  This prevents the battery from ever being below 100% charge, preventing sulfate from forming.  Proper temperature compensated [[float voltage]] should be used to achieve the best results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|Alternator]] \u2013 battery charging device in car\n* [[Electric bus#Charging]]\n* [[Battery eliminator]]\n* [[Battery management system]]\n* [[Charge controller]]\n* [[FuelRod]] \u2013 a kiosk-based charging service \n* [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n* [[Recharging alkaline batteries]]\n* [[Solar energy]]\n* [[Solar lamp]]\n* [[State of charge]] (batteries)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Battery chargers|Battery charger}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battery Charger}}\n[[Category:Battery chargers| ]]\n[[Category:Battery charging]]\n[[Category:Rechargeable batteries]]\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n", "name_user": "Mheal.in", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger"}

Farmer wrote the lyrics to the hit song, which peaked at #16 in the charts. He also co-wrote with Nugent or self composed, twenty two compositions to help complete the first three albums created by The Amboy Dukes.\n\n==Amboy Dukes==\n\nThe Dukes' first offering was their self-titled album ''[[The Amboy Dukes (album)|The Amboy Dukes]]'' which charted. It featured their first charting single \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\", an intense cover of a [[Big Joe Williams]] song. The second album was ''[[Journey to the Center of the Mind]]'' a psychedelic rock opera that was their highest charting album and produced their most commercially successful single. The third album was ''[[Migration (The Amboy Dukes album)|Migration]]''. Although not a commercial success, it showed a refinement of both Farmer's songwriting skills and Nugent's songwriting and guitar skills. All three albums (released by [[Mainstream Records]]) featured Farmer touches in words and music that emphasized [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] imagery, so central to late sixties pop culture.\n\n==New Journey==\n\nIn 2000, Farmer completed work on his new millennium \"journey\". The album is titled ''Journey to the Darkside of the Mind'' and was released by Saint Thomas Records. Fellow Amboy Dukes member [[Rick Lober]] contributed to the album. It was produced by Victor Peraino, who is known for his innovative work on the [[Mellotron]] with England's [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable unsortable\"\n|-\n!

This Heat's commercial success was limited, and their discography consisted of only two albums and an EP, but in later years the band have been widely considered a link between early 1970s music styles such as [[krautrock]] and later experimental genres such as [[industrial music]] and [[post-rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/deceit-mw0000073264 |title=''Deceit'' \u2013 This Heat : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Kellman |first=Andy |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nWilliams died of cancer in 2001. From 2016 until 2019, Bullen and Hayward reunited, playing under the name '''This Is Not This Heat'''.\n\n==History==\nThis Heat first came together in 1976 by Charles Hayward and Charles Bullen. Hayward was a member of the progressive rock band [[Quiet Sun]], fronted by guitarist [[Phil Manzanera]] of [[Roxy Music]]. In 1975, Quiet Sun had signed a deal with [[Island Records]] to record an album entitled ''Mainstream''. Whilst touring to support the record, Manzanera stepped down as his commitments with Roxy Music were taking up his time, so Bullen stepped in as a replacement. Quiet Sun dissolved shortly afterwards, but Bullen and Hayward, who had bonded over their similar tastes in music, decided to continue working together. After toying with the names Dolphin Logic and Friendly Rifles, they were joined by visual artist Gareth Williams, brought on due to his lack of musical training, and the trio settled upon This Heat in reference to the [[1976 British Isles heat wave]], regarded at the time as the hottest summer on record.\n\nThis Heat's first radio airplay came in early 1977 from legendary DJ [[John Peel]], to whom they sent a demo tape recorded in the top room at Hayward's parents' house in [[Camberwell]], prior to moving into their 'Cold Storage' studio \u2014 a disused cold storage room converted into a studio, which was part of an \"Acme Studios\" artists studios complex in [[Brixton]]. During this time, they also recorded a session with Ghanaian percussionist Mario Boyer Diekuuroh, parts of which later appeared on a 1982 split cassette with Albert Marcoeur, released by the French experimental rock magazine ''Tago Mago''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nTheir [[This Heat (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded between February 1976 and September 1978 in various studios and venues, and was released in August 1979. It was characterised by heavy use of [[tape music|tape manipulation]] and [[tape loops|looping]] (especially on the track \"24 Track Loop\" which was a loop actually on the 2\" master tape), combined with more traditional performance (including quite a lot of live stereo microphone in the room recordings) to create dense, eerie, electronic soundscapes. Shortly thereafter, This Heat released the ''[[Health and Efficiency (EP)|Health and Efficiency]]'' EP, which foreshadowed the more rock-oriented sound of their subsequent album.\n\nThis Heat then signed a record deal with [[Rough Trade Records]], who released ''[[Deceit (album)|Deceit]]'', the band's second and final album, in 1981. Whilst maintaining their experimental approach, ''Deceit'' found the band incorporating more coherent song structures, and consolidating the dub and world music influences in their work. The album was produced with help from noted [[reggae]] mixer [[Martin Frederick]]. Although at the time, like all of This Heat's releases, it sold poorly, ''Deceit'' is now seen as a classic of the [[post-punk]] era. By that time ''Deceit'' was released, Williams had since exited from the band.\n\nThis Heat split up in 1982 after completing their final European tour with bassist-vocalist [[Trefor Goronwy]] and keyboardist Ian Hill joining Bullen and Hayward, as Williams had departed for India. Hayward went on to form [[Camberwell Now]] with Goronwy and Stephen Rickard, and remains musically active. Bullen had a solo venture called [[Lifetones]], and released one record, ''[[For a Reason]]'', in 1983 on his Tone of Life imprint and in 1998 released the album ''Internal Clock'' under the name Circadian Rhythms. Williams later formed Flaming Tunes with Mary Currie and released a cassette of material, which was later released on CD.\n\nIn 1993 a new album of previously unreleased This Heat recordings was unearthed. ''Repeat'' featured three long tracks, including the title track, a 20-minute remix of \"24 Track Loop\". ''Out of Cold Storage'', a [[box set]] of all the band's official recordings, was released in June 2006 on This is!, a new [[Recommended Records]] sub-label set up by Hayward and Bullen to re-release This Heat's back catalogue. The set comprises ''This Heat'', ''Deceit'', ''Health and Efficiency'', ''Made Available'' and ''Repeat'', plus ''Live 80/81'', a CD of concert recordings.<ref name=\"boxset\">{{cite book |last=Cutler |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Cutler |title=Out of Cold Storage |year=2006 |type=booklet |location=[[Thornton Heath]], England |publisher=[[Recommended Records]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2001 This Heat tentatively rehearsed (with Williams); however, nothing came to fruition as Williams died later that month of cancer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/07/guardianobituaries |title=Obituary: Gareth Williams |last=Baxter |first=Ed |date=7 February 2002 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Bullen and Hayward reunited under the name This Is Not This Heat to perform a number of critically acclaimed gigs in London. The concerts featured several guests such as [[Thurston Moore]], [[Alexis Taylor]] and [[Daniel O'Sullivan (musician)|Daniel O'Sullivan]]. The reunion continued across the following three years, concluding with a small series of shows in London, New York, and Los Angeles in 2019.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Influence===\n\nBands and artists that have called This Heat either an influence or a favourite include [[David Bowie]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2016/01/23/this-heat-interview/|title=Watch As The Earth Burns: Charles Hayward and Charles Bullen reflect on This Heat|website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]|author=Robert Ham|quote=\u201c[[Owen Pallett]] said recently that he had gone to dinner with Bowie,\u201d says Hayward, \u201cand the topics of conversation were [Japanese novelist, Yukio] [[Yukio Mishima|Mishima]] and This Heat.

This Heat's commercial success was limited, and their discography consisted of only two albums and an EP, but in later years the band have been widely considered a link between early 1970s music styles such as [[krautrock]] and later experimental genres such as [[industrial music]] and [[post-rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/deceit-mw0000073264 |title=''Deceit'' \u2013 This Heat : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Kellman |first=Andy |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nWilliams died of cancer in 2001. From 2016 until 2019, Bullen and Hayward reunited, playing under the name '''This Is Not This Heat'''.\n\n==History==\nThis Heat first came together in 1976 by Charles Hayward and Charles Bullen. Hayward was a member of the progressive rock band [[Quiet Sun]], fronted by guitarist [[Phil Manzanera]] of [[Roxy Music]]. In 1975, Quiet Sun had signed a deal with [[Island Records]] to record an album entitled ''Mainstream''. Whilst touring to support the record, Manzanera stepped down as his commitments with Roxy Music were taking up his time, so Bullen stepped in as a replacement. Quiet Sun dissolved shortly afterwards, but Bullen and Hayward, who had bonded over their similar tastes in music, decided to continue working together. After toying with the names Dolphin Logic and Friendly Rifles, they were joined by visual artist Gareth Williams, brought on due to his lack of musical training, and the trio settled upon This Heat in reference to the [[1976 British Isles heat wave]], regarded at the time as the hottest summer on record.\n\nThis Heat's first radio airplay came in early 1977 from legendary DJ [[John Peel]], to whom they sent a demo tape recorded in the top room at Hayward's parents' house in [[Camberwell]], prior to moving into their 'Cold Storage' studio \u2014 a disused cold storage room converted into a studio, which was part of an \"Acme Studios\" artists studios complex in [[Brixton]]. During this time, they also recorded a session with Ghanaian percussionist Mario Boyer Diekuuroh, parts of which later appeared on a 1982 split cassette with Albert Marcoeur, released by the French experimental rock magazine ''Tago Mago''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nTheir [[This Heat (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded between February 1976 and September 1978 in various studios and venues, and was released in August 1979. It was characterised by heavy use of [[tape music|tape manipulation]] and [[tape loops|looping]] (especially on the track \"24 Track Loop\" which was a loop actually on the 2\" master tape), combined with more traditional performance (including quite a lot of live stereo microphone in the room recordings) to create dense, eerie, electronic soundscapes. Shortly thereafter, This Heat released the ''[[Health and Efficiency (EP)|Health and Efficiency]]'' EP, which foreshadowed the more rock-oriented sound of their subsequent album.\n\nThis Heat then signed a record deal with [[Rough Trade Records]], who released ''[[Deceit (album)|Deceit]]'', the band's second and final album, in 1981. Whilst maintaining their experimental approach, ''Deceit'' found the band incorporating more coherent song structures, and consolidating the dub and world music influences in their work. The album was produced with help from noted [[reggae]] mixer [[Martin Frederick]]. Although at the time, like all of This Heat's releases, it sold poorly, ''Deceit'' is now seen as a classic of the [[post-punk]] era. By that time ''Deceit'' was released, Williams had since exited from the band.\n\nThis Heat split up in 1982 after completing their final European tour with bassist-vocalist [[Trefor Goronwy]] and keyboardist Ian Hill joining Bullen and Hayward, as Williams had departed for India. Hayward went on to form [[Camberwell Now]] with Goronwy and Stephen Rickard, and remains musically active. Bullen had a solo venture called [[Lifetones]], and released one record, ''[[For a Reason]]'', in 1983 on his Tone of Life imprint and in 1998 released the album ''Internal Clock'' under the name Circadian Rhythms. Williams later formed Flaming Tunes with Mary Currie and released a cassette of material, which was later released on CD.\n\nIn 1993 a new album of previously unreleased This Heat recordings was unearthed. ''Repeat'' featured three long tracks, including the title track, a 20-minute remix of \"24 Track Loop\". ''Out of Cold Storage'', a [[box set]] of all the band's official recordings, was released in June 2006 on This is!, a new [[Recommended Records]] sub-label set up by Hayward and Bullen to re-release This Heat's back catalogue. The set comprises ''This Heat'', ''Deceit'', ''Health and Efficiency'', ''Made Available'' and ''Repeat'', plus ''Live 80/81'', a CD of concert recordings.<ref name=\"boxset\">{{cite book |last=Cutler |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Cutler |title=Out of Cold Storage |year=2006 |type=booklet |location=[[Thornton Heath]], England |publisher=[[Recommended Records]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2001 This Heat tentatively rehearsed (with Williams); however, nothing came to fruition as Williams died later that month of cancer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/07/guardianobituaries |title=Obituary: Gareth Williams |last=Baxter |first=Ed |date=7 February 2002 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Bullen and Hayward reunited under the name This Is Not This Heat to perform a number of critically acclaimed gigs in London.

In 2016, Clara ([[S\u00f4nia Braga]]), now a retired journalist and writer, is still living in the same apartment, but alone, since her husband died 17 years before and her three children have moved out. Her only constant company is her maid Ladjane ([[Zoraide Coleto]]).\n\nShe refuses to accept a buy-out from Geraldo (Fernando Teixeira), head of Bonfim, and a developing company that wishes to reclaim her apartment in order to replace the old building with a larger and homonymous edifice, even though all the other apartments are already vacant and despite her own children's advice to accept the offer.\n\nThe developers, especially the proprietor's grandson, American educated designer and head of the new Aquarius project Diego ([[Humberto Carr\u00e3o]]), become frustrated with Clara's resistance and try to disturb her through a number of means, including throwing parties at the apartment right above hers and burning mattresses at the parking lot. Eventually, in an open argument, she berates Diego that education without decency amounts to nothing.\n\nClara starts digging up dirt on Bonfim through her contacts.

Among them, a person with a hiatal hernia can experience dull pains in the chest, [[shortness of breath]] (caused by the hernia's effect on the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]), [[heart palpitations]] (due to irritation of the [[vagus nerve]]), and swallowed food \"balling up\" and causing discomfort in the lower esophagus until it passes on to the stomach.  In addition, hiatal hernias often result in [[heartburn]] but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.<ref name=\"BMJ2014\"/>\n\nIn most cases however, a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms. The pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile. While there are several causes of [[acid reflux]], it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia.\n\nIn newborns, the presence of [[Bochdalek hernia]] can be recognised<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang SW, Lee HC, Yeung CY, Chan WT, Hsu CH, Kao HA, Hung HY, Chang JH, Sheu JC, Wang NL |title=A twenty-year review of early and late-presenting congenital Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia: are they different clinical spectra? |journal=Pediatr Neonatol |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=26\u201330 |year=2010 |pmid=20225535 |doi=10.1016/S1875-9572(10)60006-X }}</ref> from symptoms such as difficulty breathing<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23810174 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.04.076 | volume=96 | issue=4 | title=Diaphragmatic hernia after esophagectomy in 440 patients with long-term follow-up |vauthors=Ganeshan DM, Correa AM, Bhosale P, Vaporciyan AA, Rice D, Mehran RJ, Walsh GL, Iyer R, Roth JA, Swisher SG, Hofstetter WL| journal=Ann Thorac Surg | pages=1138\u201345| year=2013 }}</ref> fast respiration, increased heart rate.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A |last=Alam |first2=B.N. |last2=Chander |title=Adult bochdalek hernia |journal=MJAFI |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=284\u20136 |date=July 2005 |doi=10.1016/S0377-1237(05)80177-7 |pmid=27407781 |url=|pmc=4925637 }}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nThere are several reasons why you get a weakened diaphragm, a hiatus hernia. The muscle weakness may be congenital or due to acquired injury or accident (radiation, disease affecting musclesor surgery).

The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications.

Among them, a person with a hiatal hernia can experience dull pains in the chest, [[shortness of breath]] (caused by the hernia's effect on the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]), [[heart palpitations]] (due to irritation of the [[vagus nerve]]), and swallowed food \"balling up\" and causing discomfort in the lower esophagus until it passes on to the stomach.  In addition, hiatal hernias often result in [[heartburn]] but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.<ref name=\"BMJ2014\"/>\n\nIn most cases however, a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms. The pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile.

In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Cape Town was permanently ceded to the United Kingdom. It became the capital of the newly formed [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s.

These trains terminate at [[Cape Town railway station]] and make a brief stop at [[Bellville railway station|Bellville]]. Cape Town is also one terminus of the luxury tourist-oriented [[Blue Train (South Africa)|Blue Train]] as well as the five-star [[Rovos Rail]].\n\n[[Metrorail (Western Cape)|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Cape Town and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.\n\n=== Road ===\nCape Town is the origin of three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]]. The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] and [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] begin in the foreshore area near the City Center.\n\nThe N1 runs East-North-East through [[Edgemead, Cape Town|Edgemead]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], and [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]]. It connects Cape Town to major cities further inland, namely [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], and [[Pretoria]] An older at-grade road, the [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville.\n[[File:Khayelitsha at N2 road, Cape Town (2015).jpg|thumb|[[Khayelitsha]], Township along [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] (2015)]]\nThe N2 runs East-South-Ease through [[Rondebosch]], [[Guguletu]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]] to [[Somerset West]]. It becomes a multiple-carriageway at-grade road from the intersection with the [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] onwards. The N2 continues east along the coast, linking Cape Town to the coastal cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R102 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the suburbs of [[Kuils River]] and [[Eerste River, Western Cape|Eerste River]].\n\nThe [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Edgemead. It runs north, initially as a highway, but becoming an at-grade road from the intersection with the M5 (Potsdam Rd) onwards. It links Cape Town with towns further North and eventually, [[Namibia]].\n\nThere are also a number of [[Provincial route (South Africa)|regional routes]] linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The [[R27 road (South Africa)|R27]] originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Table View, Cape Town|Table View]] and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]] and links the City to the West Coast, ending at the town of [[Velddrif]]. The [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] enters the east of the metro from the north, from [[Stellenbosch]]. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]]. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of [[Betty's Bay]] and [[Kleinmond]].\n\nOf the three-digit routes, the [[R300 road (South Africa)|R300]], is an expressway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near [[Mitchells Plain]] and the [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The [[R302 road (South Africa)|R302]] runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through [[Durbanville]] leaving the metro to [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]. The [[R304 road (South Africa)|R304]] enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at [[Philadelphia, Western Cape|Philadelphia]] to end at [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] at a junction with the\\s[[R307 road (South Africa)|R307]]. This R307 starts north of [[Koeberg]] from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]. The [[R310 road (South Africa)|R310]] originates from [[Muizenberg]] and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.\n\nCape Town, like most South African cities, uses [[Metropolitan Routes in Cape Town|Metropolitan]] or \"M\" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. However, the [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road.\n\nCape Town suffers from the worst traffic congestion in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201021928/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|archive-date=1 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=R750 million to fight traffic in SA's most congested city|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208104036/http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TomTom congestion Index.png|center|500px]]\n\n=== Buses ===\n[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services in the Cape Town metropolitan area. Several companies run long-distance bus services from Cape Town to the other cities in South Africa.\n\n=== Integrated Rapid Transit (IRT) ===\n{{main|MyCiTi}}\nCape Town has a public transport system in about 10% of the city, running north to south along the west coastline of the city, comprising Phase 1 of the IRT system. This is known as the MyCiTi service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myciti.org.za/en/home/|title=MyCiTi|accessdate=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225063521/http://myciti.org.za/en/home/|archive-date=25 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMyCiTi Phase 1 includes services linking the Airport to the Cape Town inner city, as well as the following areas: [[Bloubergstrand|Blouberg]] / [[Table View]], [[Dunoon, Cape Town|Dunoon]], [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] and [[Melkbosstrand]], [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], Paarden Eiland, [[Century City, Cape Town|Century City]], [[Salt River, Cape Town|Salt River]] and [[Walmer Estate, Cape Town|Walmer Estate]], and all suburbs of the [[City Bowl]] and [[Cape Town#Atlantic Seaboard|Atlantic Seaboard]] all the way to [[Llandudno, Cape Town|Llandudno]] and [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]].\n\nThe MyCiTi N2 Express service consists of two routes each linking the Cape Town inner city and [[Khayelitsha]] and [[Mitchells Plain]] on the [[Cape Flats]].\n\nThe service use high floor articulated and standard size buses in dedicated busways, low floor articulated and standard size buses on the N2 Express service, and smaller {{convert|9|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Optare]] buses in suburban and inner city areas. It offers [[Accessibility#Transportation|universal access]] through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the [[EMV]] compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from 3 mins to 20 mins in peak times to 60 minutes during quiet off-peak periods.\n\n=== Taxis ===\nCape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.\n\nCape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and [[Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]]. There are about one thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre. The larger taxi companies in Cape Town are Excite Taxis, Cabnet and Intercab and single operators are reachable by cellular phone. The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.\n\nMinibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |publisher=CapeTown.org |title=Transport |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184051/http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |archivedate=28 November 2011  }}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy.

The rainfall patterns on the Cape Flats vary with longitude, such that the eastern parts get a minimum of 214mm per year and the central and western parts get 800mm per year.  A significant portion of this water ends up in the Cape Flats Aquifer, which lie beneath the central and southern parts of the Cape Flats. Most of the land of the Cape Flats is used for residential areas, the majority of which are [[Suburb|formal]], but with several [[Shanty town|informal settlements]] present.

The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.\n\n=== Road ===\nCape Town is the origin of three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]]. The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] and [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] begin in the foreshore area near the City Center.\n\nThe N1 runs East-North-East through [[Edgemead, Cape Town|Edgemead]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], and [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]]. It connects Cape Town to major cities further inland, namely [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], and [[Pretoria]] An older at-grade road, the [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville.\n[[File:Khayelitsha at N2 road, Cape Town (2015).jpg|thumb|[[Khayelitsha]], Township along [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] (2015)]]\nThe N2 runs East-South-Ease through [[Rondebosch]], [[Guguletu]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]] to [[Somerset West]]. It becomes a multiple-carriageway at-grade road from the intersection with the [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] onwards. The N2 continues east along the coast, linking Cape Town to the coastal cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R102 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the suburbs of [[Kuils River]] and [[Eerste River, Western Cape|Eerste River]].\n\nThe [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Edgemead. It runs north, initially as a highway, but becoming an at-grade road from the intersection with the M5 (Potsdam Rd) onwards. It links Cape Town with towns further North and eventually, [[Namibia]].\n\nThere are also a number of [[Provincial route (South Africa)|regional routes]] linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The [[R27 road (South Africa)|R27]] originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Table View, Cape Town|Table View]] and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]] and links the City to the West Coast, ending at the town of [[Velddrif]]. The [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] enters the east of the metro from the north, from [[Stellenbosch]]. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]]. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of [[Betty's Bay]] and [[Kleinmond]].\n\nOf the three-digit routes, the [[R300 road (South Africa)|R300]], is an expressway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near [[Mitchells Plain]] and the [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The [[R302 road (South Africa)|R302]] runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through [[Durbanville]] leaving the metro to [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]. The [[R304 road (South Africa)|R304]] enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at [[Philadelphia, Western Cape|Philadelphia]] to end at [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] at a junction with the\\s[[R307 road (South Africa)|R307]]. This R307 starts north of [[Koeberg]] from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]. The [[R310 road (South Africa)|R310]] originates from [[Muizenberg]] and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.\n\nCape Town, like most South African cities, uses [[Metropolitan Routes in Cape Town|Metropolitan]] or \"M\" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. However, the [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road.\n\nCape Town suffers from the worst traffic congestion in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201021928/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|archive-date=1 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=R750 million to fight traffic in SA's most congested city|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208104036/http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TomTom congestion Index.png|center|500px]]\n\n=== Buses ===\n[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services in the Cape Town metropolitan area.

It offers [[Accessibility#Transportation|universal access]] through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the [[EMV]] compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from 3 mins to 20 mins in peak times to 60 minutes during quiet off-peak periods.\n\n=== Taxis ===\nCape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.\n\nCape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and [[Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]]. There are about one thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre.
