For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI Spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's \"the Book of the Machines\" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365\u2013383</ref> \n{{quote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}\nIn 1951, computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote an article titled ''Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory'', in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \"take control\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:\n{{quote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them...

They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence.\" They concluded that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.

Such a machine may not have humanity's best interests at heart; it is not obvious that it would even care about human welfare at all.

(It may initially lack human or superhuman capabilities in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.) Due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, the AI quickly becomes superhuman; just as human experts can eventually creatively overcome \"diminishing returns\" by deploying various human capabilities for innovation, so too can the expert-level AI use either human-style capabilities or its own AI-specific capabilities to power through new creative breakthroughs.<ref>Yampolskiy, Roman V. \"Analysis of types of self-improving software.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/> However, the actual danger to humanity in such a scenario could in fact greatly increase as the AI becomes smarter if the AI's goals are not aligned with humanity's.\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]]. The team also faces risks that its decision to box the project will delay the project long enough for another project to overtake it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|title=Artificial intelligence: The future is superintelligent|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/548520a|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=Nature|date=30 August 2017|pages=520\u2013521|language=En|doi=10.1038/548520a|bibcode=2017Natur.548..520R}}</ref><ref name=\"life 3.0\"/><!-- Prelude and Chapter 4 -->\n\nIn contrast, top physicist [[Michio Kaku]], an AI risk skeptic, posits a [[technological determinism|deterministically]] positive outcome.

Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] writes:\n\n{{cquote|The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make ''high-quality decisions''. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:\n\n# The utility function may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down.\n# Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources \u2014 not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task.\n\nA system that is [[optimization problem|optimizing]] a function of ''n'' variables, where the [[loss function|objective]] depends on a subset of size ''k''<''n'', will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.  This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want. A highly capable decision maker \u2014 especially one connected through the Internet to all the world's information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure \u2014 can have an irreversible impact on humanity.\n\nThis is not a minor difficulty. Improving decision quality, irrespective of the utility function chosen, has been the goal of AI research \u2014 the mainstream goal on which we now spend billions per year, not the secret plot of some lone evil genius.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015 |title=Of Myths and Moonshine |last=Russell |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart J.

Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern for existing systems: \"An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people ''intend'' rather than carrying out commands literally.\" This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility.<ref name=\"acm\"/> For example, in 1982, an AI named Eurisko was tasked to reward processes for apparently creating concepts deemed by the system to be valuable. The evolution resulted in a winning process that cheated: rather than create its own concepts, the winning process would steal credit from other processes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yampolskiy|first1=Roman V.|title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents|journal=Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=8 April 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=373\u2013389|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eurisko: A Program That Learns New Heuristics and Domain Concepts The Nature of Heuristics III: Program Design and Results|last = Lenat|first = Douglas|date = 1982|journal = Artificial Intelligence|doi = 10.1016/s0004-3702(83)80005-8|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 61\u201398|type = Print |volume=21|issue = 1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Open Philanthropy Project]] summarizes arguments to the effect that misspecified goals will become a much larger concern if AI systems achieve [[artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]] or [[superintelligence]]. Bostrom, Russell, and others argue that smarter-than-human decision-making systems could arrive at more [[Paperclip maximizer|unexpected and extreme solutions]] to assigned tasks, and could modify themselves or their environment in ways that compromise safety requirements.<ref name=\"givewell\" /><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\n[[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]] are one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI agents. Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.  Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:<ref>Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) \"Chapter 22: Morality\" In Handbook of Social Psychology,  Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832.</ref> \"to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible\". He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt\u2019s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |pages = 106\u2013111|type = Print |volume=71}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===\n{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}\n\nWhile current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, \"self-aware\" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and be able to prevent itself being \"turned off\" or being reprogrammed with a new goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><ref>Yudkowsky, Eliezer. \"Complex value systems in friendly AI.\" In Artificial general intelligence, pp. 388-393.

In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).</ref> This could prove problematic because it might put an artificial intelligence in direct competition with humans.\n\nCiting [[Steve Omohundro]]'s work on the idea of [[instrumental convergence]] and \"basic AI drives\", Russell and [[Peter Norvig]] write that \"even if you only want your program to play chess or prove theorems, if you give it the capability to learn and alter itself, you need safeguards.\" Highly capable and autonomous planning systems require additional checks because of their potential to generate plans that treat humans adversarially, as competitors for limited resources.<ref name=\"aima\"/> Building in safeguards will not be easy; one can certainly say in English, \"we want you to design this power plant in a reasonable, common-sense way, and not build in any dangerous covert subsystems\", but it's not currently clear how one would actually rigorously specify this goal in machine code.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\nIn dissent, evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] argues that \"AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world\"; perhaps instead \"artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization.\"<ref name=shermer/> Computer scientists [[Yann LeCun]] and Stuart Russell disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives; LeCun states that \"Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives\", while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine \"will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal.\"<ref name=vanity>{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|title=Elon Musk's Billion-Dollar Crusade to Stop the A.I.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|last = Bostrom|first = Nick|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-19-967811-2|location = Oxford, United Kingdom|pages = 116}}</ref> Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: a human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider \"reasonable\", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf|title = Superintelligent Will|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-10-29|website = Nick Bostrom|publisher = Nick Bostrom|last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}</ref>\n\nWhile the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical \"[[is-ought distinction]]\", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any \"rational\" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical \"optimizing machine\" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any \"moral facts\" that would get in the way of goal completion.<ref name=armstrong/>\n\nOne argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a {{nowrap|minus (\"-\") sign}} onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI Spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/> However, the actual danger to humanity in such a scenario could in fact greatly increase as the AI becomes smarter if the AI's goals are not aligned with humanity's.\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]].

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J.

Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R.

[[Norse mythology]], the source of most surviving information about him, associates Odin with wisdom, healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, war, battle, victory, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the [[Runes| runic alphabet]], and portrays him as the husband of the goddess [[Frigg]]. In wider Germanic mythology and [[Germanic paganism| paganism]], the god was known in [[Old English]] as '''{{lang|ang|W\u014dden}}''', in [[Old Saxon]] as '''{{lang|osx|W\u014ddan}}''', in [[Old Dutch]] as '''''Wuodan'''''<ref>W.J.J. Pijnenburg (1980), Bijdrage tot de etymologie van het oudste Nederlands, Eindhoven, hoofdstuk 7 'Dinsdag - Woensdag'</ref>and in [[Old High German]] as '''{{lang|goh|Wuotan}}'''.<!-- Please note that all of these example forms are drawn from Orel\u2014please see the etymology section below -->\n\nOdin appears as a prominent god throughout the recorded history of [[Europe]], from the Roman occupation of regions of [[Germania]] (from {{circa | 12 }} BCE) through the tribal expansions of the [[Migration Period]] (4th to 6th centuries CE) and the [[Viking Age]] (8th to 11th centuries CE). In the modern period the rural folklore of Germanic Europe continued to acknowledge Odin.  References to him appear in place names throughout regions historically inhabited by the ancient Germanic peoples, and the day of the week [[Wednesday]] bears his name in many Germanic languages, including in English.\n\nIn [[Old English]] texts, Odin holds a particular place as a [[euhemerism| euhemerized]] ancestral figure among royalty, and he is frequently referred to as a founding figure among various other Germanic peoples, such as the [[Langobards]]. Forms of his name appear frequently throughout the Germanic record, though narratives regarding Odin are mainly found in [[Old Norse]] works recorded in [[Icelandic Commonwealth | Iceland]], primarily around the 13th century. These texts make up the bulk of modern understanding of Norse mythology.\n\nOld Norse texts portray Odin as one-eyed and long-bearded, frequently wielding a spear named [[Gungnir]] and wearing a cloak and a broad hat. He is often accompanied by his animal companions and [[familiars]]\u2014the wolves [[Geri and Freki]] and the ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]], who bring him information from all over {{lang|non|[[Midgard]]|italic= no}}\u2014and rides the flying, eight-legged steed [[Sleipnir]] across the sky and into the underworld. Odin is the son of [[Bestla]] and [[Borr]] and has two brothers, [[Vili and V\u00e9]]. Odin is attested as having [[sons of Odin |many sons]], most famously the gods [[Thor]] (with {{lang|non|[[J\u00f6r\u00f0]]|italic= no}}) and {{lang|non|[[Baldr]]|italic= no}} (with {{lang|non|[[Frigg]]|italic=no}}), and is known by [[list of names of Odin| hundreds of names]]. In these texts he frequently seeks greater knowledge, at times in disguise (most famously by obtaining the [[Mead of Poetry]]), makes wagers with his wife Frigg over the outcome of exploits, and takes part both in the [[creation myth | creation of the world]] by way of slaying the primordial being {{lang|non|[[Ymir]]|italic=no}} and in giving the gift of life to the first two humans [[Ask and Embla]]. Odin has a particular association with [[Yule]], and mankind's knowledge of both the [[runes]] and [[skaldic poetry|poetry]] is also attributed to him, giving Odin aspects of the [[culture hero]].\n\nOld Norse texts associate female beings connected with the battlefield\u2014the [[valkyries]]\u2014with the god, and Odin oversees [[Valhalla]], where he receives half of those who die in battle, the {{lang|non|[[einherjar]]}}. The other half are chosen by the goddess {{lang|non|[[Freyja]]|italic= no}} for her afterlife-location, {{lang|non|[[F\u00f3lkvangr]]|italic= no}}. Odin consults the disembodied, [[embalming| herb-embalmed]] head of the wise being {{lang|non|[[M\u00edmir]]|italic= no}} for advice, and during the foretold events of {{lang|non|[[Ragnar\u00f6k]]|italic= no}} Odin is told to lead the {{lang|non|einherjar}} into battle before being consumed by the monstrous wolf {{lang|non|[[Fenrir]]|italic= no}}. In later folklore Odin appears as a leader of the [[Wild Hunt]], a ghostly procession of the dead through the winter sky. He is associated with charms and other forms of magic, particularly in Old English and Old Norse texts.\n\nOdin is a frequent subject of interest in [[Germanic studies]], and scholars have advanced numerous theories regarding his development. Some of these focus on Odin's particular relation to other figures; for example, the fact that {{lang|non|Freyja|italic= no}}'s husband {{lang|non|[[\u00d3\u00f0r]]|italic= no}} appears to be something of an etymological doublet of the god, whereas Odin's wife {{lang|non|Frigg|italic=no}} is in many ways similar to {{lang|non|Freyja|italic= no}}, and that Odin has a particular relation to the figure of {{lang|non|[[Loki]]|italic= no}}. Other approaches focus on Odin's place in the historical record, a frequent question being whether the figure of Odin derives from [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]], or whether he developed later in [[Germanic society]]. In the modern period the figure of Odin has inspired numerous works of poetry, music, and other cultural expressions. He is venerated in most forms of the new religious movement [[Heathenry (new religious movement)| Heathenry]], together with other gods venerated by the ancient Germanic peoples; some branches focus particularly on him.\n\n==Etymology, other names, and ''Wednesday''==\nThe Old Norse [[theonym]] ''\u00d3\u00f0inn'' (runic {{script|Runr|{{lang|non|\u16a2\u16a6\u16c1\u16be|italic=no}}}} on the [[Ribe skull fragment]])<ref>{{citation \n | title = The transformation of the older fu\u00feark: Number magic, runographic or linguistic principles?\n | work = Arkiv f\u00f6r nordisk filologi\n | volume = 121\n | year = 2006\n | last = Schulte\n | first = Michael\n | pages = 41-74}}</ref> and its [[cognate]]s, including [[Old English]] ''W\u014dden'', [[Old Saxon]] ''W\u014dden'', and [[Old High German]] ''Wuotan'', derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym ''*w\u014d\u0111anaz''. The masculine noun ''*w\u014d\u0111anaz'' developed from the Proto-Germanic adjective ''*w\u014d\u0111az'', related to [[Latin]] ''v\u0101t\u0113s'' and [[Old Irish]] ''f\u00e1ith'', both meaning 'seer, [[prophet]]'. Adjectives stemming from ''*w\u014d\u0111az'' include [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''wo\u00fes'' 'possessed', Old Norse ''\u00f3\u00f0r'', 'mad, frantic, furious', and Old English ''w\u014dd'' 'mad'.<ref name=\"OREL-469\">Orel (2003:469).</ref> In his opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', [[Richard Wagner]] refers to the god as ''Wotan'', a spelling of his own invention which combines the Old High German ''Wuotan'' with the [[Low German]] ''Wodan''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haymes |first=Edward R. |chapter=''Ring of the Nibelungen'' and the ''Nibelungenlied'': Wagner's Ambiguous Relationship to a Source |title=Studies in Medievalism XVII: Redefining Medievalism(s) |year=2009 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |p=223}}</ref>\n\n[[List of names of Odin|More than 170 names]] are recorded for Odin; the names are variously descriptive of attributes of the god, refer to myths involving him, or refer to religious practices associated with him. This multitude makes Odin the god with the most known names among the Germanic peoples.<ref name=\"SIMEK-248\">Simek (2007:248).</ref>\n\nThe modern English [[Names of the days of the week|weekday]] name ''Wednesday'' derives from Old English ''w\u014ddnesd\u00e6g'', meaning \"day of Woden\". Cognate terms are found in other Germanic languages, such as [[Middle Low German]] ''w\u014ddensdach'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''woensdag'' and [[Old Norse]] ''\u00d3\u00f0insdagr'' (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish ''Onsdag''). All of these terms derive from Proto-Germanic *''Wodensdag'', itself a Germanic interpretation of Latin ''Dies Mercurii'' (\"Day of Mercury\"). In Old High German, the name derived from Odin's was replaced by a translation of Church Latin ''media hebdomas'' ('middle of the week'), hence modern German ''Mittwoch''.<ref name=\"SIMEK-371\">Simek (2007:371)</ref>\n\n==Attestations==\n\n===Roman era to Migration Period===\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Odin is frequently referred to\u2014via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity)\u2014as the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late 1st-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind\" and adds that a portion of the {{lang|la|Suebi|italic=no}} also venerate \"Isis\". In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god Odin as \"Mercury\", Thor as \"[[Hercules]]\", and {{lang|non|[[T\u00fdr]]|italic=no}} as \"[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]\", and the identity of the [[\"Isis\" of the Suebi]] has been debated.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42, 106\u201307).</ref>\n\n[[Anthony Birley]] noted that Odin's apparent identification with Mercury has little to do with Mercury's classical role of being messenger of the gods, but appears to be due to Mercury's role of [[psychopomp]].<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\"/> Other contemporary evidence may also have led to the equation of Odin with Mercury; Odin, like Mercury, may have at this time already been pictured with a staff and hat, may have been considered a trader god, and the two may have been seen as parallel in their roles as wandering deities. But their rankings in their respective religious spheres may have been very different.<ref name=\"SIMEK244\">Simek (2007:244).</ref> Also, Tacitus's \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship\" is an exact quote from [[Julius Caesar]]'s {{lang|la|[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]|italic=yes}} (1st century BCE) in which Caesar is referring to the [[Gauls]] and not the Germanic peoples. Regarding the Germanic peoples, Caesar states: \"[T]hey consider the gods only the ones that they can see, the Sun, Fire and the Moon\", which scholars reject as clearly mistaken, regardless of what may have led to the statement.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\"/>\n\nAlthough the English kingdoms were converted as a result of [[Christianization of the Germanic peoples]] by the 7th century, Odin is frequently listed as a founding figure among the Old English royalty.<ref name=\"HERBERT-7\">Herbert (2007 [1994]:7).</ref> He is also either directly or indirectly mentioned a few times in the surviving Old English poetic corpus, including the ''[[Nine Herbs Charm]]'' and likely also the ''[[Old English rune poem]]''. Odin may also be referenced in the riddle ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]''. In the ''Nine Herbs Charm'', Odin is said to have slain a ''wyrm'' (serpent, [[European dragon]]) by way of nine \"glory twigs\". Preserved from an 11th-century manuscript, the poem is, according to Bill Griffiths, \"one of the most enigmatic of Old English texts\". The section that mentions Odin is as follows:\n{{Verse translation |lang=ang\n|1=<nowiki/> + wyrm com snican, toslat he nan,\n\u00f0a genam woden VIIII wuldortanas,\nsloh \u00f0a \u00fea n\u00e6ddran  \u00fe\u00e6t heo on VIIII tofleah\n\u00de\u00e6r ga\u00e6ndade   \u00e6ppel and attor\n\u00fe\u00e6t heo n\u00e6fre ne wolde on hus bugan.<ref name=\"GRIFFITHS-183\">Griffiths (2006 [2003]:183).</ref>\n|2= A serpent came crawling (but) it destroyed no one\nwhen Woden took nine twigs of glory,\n(and) then struck the adder so that it flew into nine (pieces).\nThere archived apple and poison\nthat it never would re-enter the house.<ref name=\"GRIFFITHS-183\"/>\n|attr2=Bill Griffiths translation\n}}\n\nThe emendation of {{lang|ang|nan}} to 'man' has been proposed. The next stanza comments on the creation of the herbs [[chervil]] and [[fennel]] while hanging in heaven by the 'wise lord' ({{lang|ang|witig drihten}}) and before sending them down among mankind. Regarding this, Griffith comments that \"In a Christian context 'hanging in heaven' would refer to [[crucifixion of Jesus|the crucifixion]]; but (remembering that Woden was mentioned a few lines previously) there is also a parallel, perhaps a better one, with Odin, as his crucifixion was associated with learning.\"<ref name=\"GRIFFITHS-183\"/> The Old English gnomic poem ''[[Maxims (Old English poems)|Maxims I]]'' also mentions Odin by name in the (alliterative) phrase {{lang|ang|Woden worhte [[v\u00e9 (shrine)|weos]]}}, ('Woden made idols'), in which he is contrasted with and denounced against the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]].<ref name=\"MAXIMS-I\">North (1997:88).</ref>\n\n[[File:Runic letter os.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|The Old English rune {{lang|ang|\u00f3s}}, which is described in the Old English rune poem]]\n\nThe Old English rune poem is a [[rune poems|rune poem]] that recounts the Old English runic alphabet, the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]]. The stanza for the rune {{lang|ang|[[ansuz (rune)|\u00f3s]]}} reads as follows:\n{{Verse translation |lang=ang\n|1= \u014ds by\u00fe ordfruma \u01e3lcre spr\u01e3ce\nw\u012bsd\u014dmes wra\u00feu and w\u012btena fr\u014dfur\nand eorla gehw\u0101m \u0113adnys and t\u014d hiht<ref name=\"POLLINGTON-46\">Pollington (2008:46).</ref>\n|2= god is the origin of all language\nwisdom's foundation and wise man's comfort\nand to every hero blessing and hope<ref name=\"POLLINGTON-46\"/>\n|attr2=Stephen Pollington\n}}\n\nThe first word of this stanza, {{lang|la|\u014ds}} (Latin 'mouth') is a homophone for Old English {{lang|ang|os}}, a particularly heathen word for 'god'. Due to this and the content of the stanzas, several scholars have posited that this poem is censored, having originally referred to Odin.<ref name=\"OE-RUNE-ODIN\">For example, Herbert (2007 [1994]:33), Pollington (2008 [1995]:18).</ref> [[Kathleen Herbert]] comments that \"{{lang|ang|Os}} was cognate with {{lang|non|As}} in Norse, where it meant one of the {{lang|non|[[\u00c6sir]]|italic=no}}, the chief family of gods. In Old English, it could be used as an element in first names: Osric, Oswald, Osmund, etc. but it was not used as a word to refer to the God of Christians. Woden was equated with Mercury, the god of eloquence (among other things). The tales about the Norse god Odin tell how he gave one of his eyes in return for wisdom; he also won the mead of poetic inspiration. Luckily for Christian rune-masters, the Latin word {{lang|la|os}} could be substituted without ruining the sense, to keep the outward form of the rune name without obviously referring to Woden.\"<ref name=\"HERBERT-33\">Herbert (2007 [1994]:33).</ref>\n\nIn the poem ''Solomon and Saturn'', \"Mercurius the Giant\" ({{lang|ang|Mercurius se gygand}}) is referred to as an inventor of letters. This may also be a reference to Odin, who is in Norse mythology the founder of the runic alphabets, and the gloss a continuation of the practice of equating Odin with Mercury found as early as Tacitus.<ref name=\"WODEN-MERCURIUS\">Chadwick (1899:29\u201330).</ref> The poem is additionally in the style of later Old Norse material featuring Odin, such as the Old Norse poem {{lang|non|[[Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l]]|italic=yes}}, featuring Odin and the {{lang|non|[[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir]]|italic=no}} engaging in a deadly game of wits.<ref name=\"WILLIAMSON-14\">Williamson (2011:14).</ref>\n\n[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Wodan and Frea look down from their window in the heavens to the Winnili women in an illustration by [[Emil Doepler]], 1905]]\n[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster II by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Winnili women with their hair tied as beards look up at Godan and Frea in an illustration by Emil Doepler, 1905]]\nThe 7th-century {{lang|la|[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]|italic=yes}}, and [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th-century {{lang|la|[[Historia Langobardorum]]|italic=yes}} derived from it, recount a founding myth of the Langobards ([[Lombards]]), a Germanic people who ruled a region of the [[Italian Peninsula]]. According to this legend, a \"small people\" known as the {{lang|la|[[Winnili]]}} were ruled by a woman named [[Gambara (Lombard)|Gambara]] who had two sons, [[Ybor and Aio]]. The [[Vandals]], ruled by [[Ambri and Assi]], came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Aio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambri and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the {{lang|la|Origo|italic=yes}}): \"Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory.\"<ref name=\"FOULKE-315-316\">Foulke (2003 [1974]:315\u201316).</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Ybor and Aio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counselled them that \"at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands\". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili and their whiskered women and asked, \"who are those Long-beards?\" Frea responded to Godan, \"As you have given them a name, give them also the victory\". Godan did so, \"so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory\".

It was the custom there that twelve temple priests were ranked highest; they administered sacrifices and held judgements over men. \"Called {{lang|non|diar}} or chiefs\", the people were obliged to serve under them and respect them. Odin was a very successful warrior and travelled widely, conquering many lands. Odin was so successful that he never lost a battle. As a result, according to the saga, men came to believe that \"it was granted to him\" to win all battles. Before Odin sent his men to war or to perform tasks for him, he would place his hands upon their heads and give them a {{lang|non|bjannak}} ('blessing', ultimately from Latin {{lang|la|benedictio}}) and the men would believe that they would also prevail. The men placed all of their faith in Odin, and wherever they called his name they would receive assistance from doing so. Odin was often gone for great spans of time.{{sfnp|Hollander|1964|p=7}}\n\nChapter 3 says that Odin had two brothers, [[Vili and V\u00e9|V\u00e9 and Vili]].

According to the chapter, Odin \"made war on the {{lang|non|Vanir|italic=no}}\". The {{lang|non|Vanir|italic=no}} defended their land and the battle turned to a stalemate, both sides having devastated one another's lands. As part of a peace agreement, the two sides exchanged hostages.

Due to the context of its placement on some objects, some scholars have interpreted this symbol as referring to Odin. For example, [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] theorises a connection between the {{lang|sv|valknut|italic=no}}, the god Odin and \"mental binds\":\n{{quote|For instance, beside the figure of Odin on his horse shown on several memorial stones there is a kind of knot depicted, called the {{lang|sv|valknut}}, related to the [[triskelion|triskele]]. This is thought to symbolize the power of the god to bind and unbind, mentioned in the poems and elsewhere. Odin had the power to lay bonds upon the mind, so that men became helpless in battle, and he could also loosen the tensions of fear and strain by his gifts of battle-madness, intoxication, and inspiration.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=147}}}}\n\nDavidson says that similar symbols are found beside figures of wolves and ravens on \"certain cremation urns\" from [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon]] cemeteries in [[East Anglia]]. According to Davidson, Odin's connection to [[cremation]] is known, and it does not seem unreasonable to connect with Odin in [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]]. Davidson proposes further connections between Odin's role as bringer of [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] by way of the etymology of the god's name.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=147}}\n\n==Origin, theories, and interpretation==\nBeginning with Henry Petersen's doctoral dissertation in 1876, which proposed that [[Thor]] was the indigenous god of Scandinavian farmers and Odin a later god proper to chieftains and poets, many scholars of Norse mythology in the past viewed Odin as having been imported from elsewhere. The idea was developed by [[Bernhard Salin]] on the basis of motifs in the [[petroglyph]]s and [[bracteate]]s, and with reference to the Prologue of the ''Prose Edda'', which presents the \u00c6sir as having migrated into Scandinavia. Salin proposed that both Odin and the [[runes]] were introduced from [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]] in the [[Iron Age]]. Other scholars placed his introduction at different times; [[Axel Olrik]], during the [[Migration Age]] as a result of [[Gauls|Gaulish]] influence.{{sfn|Vries|1970b|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nMore radically, both the archaeologist and comparative mythologist {{lang|lt|[[Marija Gimbutas]]|italic=no}} and the Germanicist [[Karl Helm]] argued that the {{lang|non|\u00c6sir|italic=no}} as a group, which includes both Thor and Odin, were late introductions into [[Northern Europe]] and that the indigenous religion of the region had been {{lang|non|[[Vanir|Vanic]]|italic=no}}.{{sfn|Polom\u00e9|1970|p=60}}{{sfn|Gimbutas|Robbins Dexter|1999|p=191}}\n\nIn the 16th century and by the entire [[Vasa dynasty]], Odin (as {{lang|sv|Oden}}) was officially considered the first King of Sweden by that country's government and historians. This was based on an embellished list of rulers invented by [[Johannes Magnus]] and adopted as fact in the reign of King [[Charles IX of Sweden|Carl IX]], who, though numbered accordingly, actually was only Carl III.<ref>Erik Pettersson in ''Den skoningsl\u00f6se, en biografi \u00f6ver Karl IX'' [[Natur & Kultur]] 2008 {{ISBN|978-91-27-02687-2}} pp. 13 & 24</ref>\n\nUnder the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] of {{lang|fr|Georges Dum\u00e9zil|italic=no}}, Odin is assigned one of the core functions in the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European pantheon]] as a representative of the first function (sovereignty) corresponding to the Hindu {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Varu\u1e47a]]|italic=no}} (fury and magic) as opposed to {{lang|non|T\u00fdr|italic=no}}, who corresponds to the Hindu {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitr\u00e1]]|italic=no}} (law and justice); while the {{lang|non|Vanir|italic=no}} represent the third function (fertility).{{sfn|Turville-Petre|1964|p=103}}{{sfn|Polom\u00e9|1970|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nAnother approach to Odin has been in terms of his function and attributes. Many early scholars interpreted him as a wind-god or especially as a death-god.{{sfn|Vries|1970b|p=93}} He has also been interpreted in the light of his association with ecstatic practices, and [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] compared him to the Hindu god [[Rudra]] and the Greek [[Hermes]].{{sfn|Vries|1970b|pp=94\u201397}}\n\n==Modern influence==\n\nOdin is often mentioned as one of the early inspirations for modern European and US Christmas traditions (see [[Santa Claus#Germanic paganism, Wodan, and Christianization|Santa Claus]]).<ref>[https://www.norwegianamerican.com/featured/dont-take-odin-out-of-yule/ The Norwegian American \u2013 Don't take the Odin out of Yule]</ref><ref>[https://vahistorymuseum.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/12-days-of-christmas-traditions-cookies-for-santa/ History Museum of Western Virginia \u2013 12 Days of Christmas Traditions]</ref>\n\n[[File:Wotan takes leave of Brunhild (1892) by Konrad Dielitz.jpg|thumb|upright|''Wotan takes leave of Brunhild'' (1892) by {{lang|de|[[Konrad Dielitz]]|italic=no}}]]\nThe god Odin has been a source of inspiration for artists working in fine art, literature, and music.

These texts make up the bulk of modern understanding of Norse mythology.\n\nOld Norse texts portray Odin as one-eyed and long-bearded, frequently wielding a spear named [[Gungnir]] and wearing a cloak and a broad hat. He is often accompanied by his animal companions and [[familiars]]\u2014the wolves [[Geri and Freki]] and the ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]], who bring him information from all over {{lang|non|[[Midgard]]|italic= no}}\u2014and rides the flying, eight-legged steed [[Sleipnir]] across the sky and into the underworld. Odin is the son of [[Bestla]] and [[Borr]] and has two brothers, [[Vili and V\u00e9]]. Odin is attested as having [[sons of Odin |many sons]], most famously the gods [[Thor]] (with {{lang|non|[[J\u00f6r\u00f0]]|italic= no}}) and {{lang|non|[[Baldr]]|italic= no}} (with {{lang|non|[[Frigg]]|italic=no}}), and is known by [[list of names of Odin| hundreds of names]]. In these texts he frequently seeks greater knowledge, at times in disguise (most famously by obtaining the [[Mead of Poetry]]), makes wagers with his wife Frigg over the outcome of exploits, and takes part both in the [[creation myth | creation of the world]] by way of slaying the primordial being {{lang|non|[[Ymir]]|italic=no}} and in giving the gift of life to the first two humans [[Ask and Embla]]. Odin has a particular association with [[Yule]], and mankind's knowledge of both the [[runes]] and [[skaldic poetry|poetry]] is also attributed to him, giving Odin aspects of the [[culture hero]].\n\nOld Norse texts associate female beings connected with the battlefield\u2014the [[valkyries]]\u2014with the god, and Odin oversees [[Valhalla]], where he receives half of those who die in battle, the {{lang|non|[[einherjar]]}}. The other half are chosen by the goddess {{lang|non|[[Freyja]]|italic= no}} for her afterlife-location, {{lang|non|[[F\u00f3lkvangr]]|italic= no}}. Odin consults the disembodied, [[embalming| herb-embalmed]] head of the wise being {{lang|non|[[M\u00edmir]]|italic= no}} for advice, and during the foretold events of {{lang|non|[[Ragnar\u00f6k]]|italic= no}} Odin is told to lead the {{lang|non|einherjar}} into battle before being consumed by the monstrous wolf {{lang|non|[[Fenrir]]|italic= no}}. In later folklore Odin appears as a leader of the [[Wild Hunt]], a ghostly procession of the dead through the winter sky. He is associated with charms and other forms of magic, particularly in Old English and Old Norse texts.\n\nOdin is a frequent subject of interest in [[Germanic studies]], and scholars have advanced numerous theories regarding his development. Some of these focus on Odin's particular relation to other figures; for example, the fact that {{lang|non|Freyja|italic= no}}'s husband {{lang|non|[[\u00d3\u00f0r]]|italic= no}} appears to be something of an etymological doublet of the god, whereas Odin's wife {{lang|non|Frigg|italic=no}} is in many ways similar to {{lang|non|Freyja|italic= no}}, and that Odin has a particular relation to the figure of {{lang|non|[[Loki]]|italic= no}}. Other approaches focus on Odin's place in the historical record, a frequent question being whether the figure of Odin derives from [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]], or whether he developed later in [[Germanic society]]. In the modern period the figure of Odin has inspired numerous works of poetry, music, and other cultural expressions. He is venerated in most forms of the new religious movement [[Heathenry (new religious movement)| Heathenry]], together with other gods venerated by the ancient Germanic peoples; some branches focus particularly on him.\n\n==Etymology, other names, and ''Wednesday''==\nThe Old Norse [[theonym]] ''\u00d3\u00f0inn'' (runic {{script|Runr|{{lang|non|\u16a2\u16a6\u16c1\u16be|italic=no}}}} on the [[Ribe skull fragment]])<ref>{{citation \n | title = The transformation of the older fu\u00feark: Number magic, runographic or linguistic principles?\n | work = Arkiv f\u00f6r nordisk filologi\n | volume = 121\n | year = 2006\n | last = Schulte\n | first = Michael\n | pages = 41-74}}</ref> and its [[cognate]]s, including [[Old English]] ''W\u014dden'', [[Old Saxon]] ''W\u014dden'', and [[Old High German]] ''Wuotan'', derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym ''*w\u014d\u0111anaz''. The masculine noun ''*w\u014d\u0111anaz'' developed from the Proto-Germanic adjective ''*w\u014d\u0111az'', related to [[Latin]] ''v\u0101t\u0113s'' and [[Old Irish]] ''f\u00e1ith'', both meaning 'seer, [[prophet]]'. Adjectives stemming from ''*w\u014d\u0111az'' include [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''wo\u00fes'' 'possessed', Old Norse ''\u00f3\u00f0r'', 'mad, frantic, furious', and Old English ''w\u014dd'' 'mad'.<ref name=\"OREL-469\">Orel (2003:469).</ref> In his opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', Richard Wagner refers to the god as ''Wotan'', a spelling of his own invention which combines the Old High German ''Wuotan'' with the [[Low German]] ''Wodan''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haymes |first=Edward R. |chapter=''Ring of the Nibelungen'' and the ''Nibelungenlied'': Wagner's Ambiguous Relationship to a Source |title=Studies in Medievalism XVII: Redefining Medievalism(s) |year=2009 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |p=223}}</ref>\n\n[[List of names of Odin|More than 170 names]] are recorded for Odin; the names are variously descriptive of attributes of the god, refer to myths involving him, or refer to religious practices associated with him. This multitude makes Odin the god with the most known names among the Germanic peoples.<ref name=\"SIMEK-248\">Simek (2007:248).</ref>\n\nThe modern English [[Names of the days of the week|weekday]] name ''Wednesday'' derives from Old English ''w\u014ddnesd\u00e6g'', meaning \"day of Woden\". Cognate terms are found in other Germanic languages, such as [[Middle Low German]] ''w\u014ddensdach'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''woensdag'' and [[Old Norse]] ''\u00d3\u00f0insdagr'' (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish ''Onsdag''). All of these terms derive from Proto-Germanic *''Wodensdag'', itself a Germanic interpretation of Latin ''Dies Mercurii'' (\"Day of Mercury\"). In Old High German, the name derived from Odin's was replaced by a translation of Church Latin ''media hebdomas'' ('middle of the week'), hence modern German ''Mittwoch''.<ref name=\"SIMEK-371\">Simek (2007:371)</ref>\n\n==Attestations==\n\n===Roman era to Migration Period===\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Odin is frequently referred to\u2014via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity)\u2014as the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late 1st-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind\" and adds that a portion of the {{lang|la|Suebi|italic=no}} also venerate \"Isis\". In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god Odin as \"Mercury\", Thor as \"[[Hercules]]\", and {{lang|non|[[T\u00fdr]]|italic=no}} as \"[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]\", and the identity of the [[\"Isis\" of the Suebi]] has been debated.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42, 106\u201307).</ref>\n\n[[Anthony Birley]] noted that Odin's apparent identification with Mercury has little to do with Mercury's classical role of being messenger of the gods, but appears to be due to Mercury's role of [[psychopomp]].<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\"/> Other contemporary evidence may also have led to the equation of Odin with Mercury; Odin, like Mercury, may have at this time already been pictured with a staff and hat, may have been considered a trader god, and the two may have been seen as parallel in their roles as wandering deities. But their rankings in their respective religious spheres may have been very different.<ref name=\"SIMEK244\">Simek (2007:244).</ref> Also, Tacitus's \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship\" is an exact quote from [[Julius Caesar]]'s {{lang|la|[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]|italic=yes}} (1st century BCE) in which Caesar is referring to the [[Gauls]] and not the Germanic peoples. Regarding the Germanic peoples, Caesar states: \"[T]hey consider the gods only the ones that they can see, the Sun, Fire and the Moon\", which scholars reject as clearly mistaken, regardless of what may have led to the statement.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\"/>\n\nAlthough the English kingdoms were converted as a result of [[Christianization of the Germanic peoples]] by the 7th century, Odin is frequently listed as a founding figure among the Old English royalty.<ref name=\"HERBERT-7\">Herbert (2007 [1994]:7).</ref> He is also either directly or indirectly mentioned a few times in the surviving Old English poetic corpus, including the ''[[Nine Herbs Charm]]'' and likely also the ''[[Old English rune poem]]''. Odin may also be referenced in the riddle ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]''. In the ''Nine Herbs Charm'', Odin is said to have slain a ''wyrm'' (serpent, [[European dragon]]) by way of nine \"glory twigs\". Preserved from an 11th-century manuscript, the poem is, according to Bill Griffiths, \"one of the most enigmatic of Old English texts\". The section that mentions Odin is as follows:\n{{Verse translation |lang=ang\n|1=<nowiki/> + wyrm com snican, toslat he nan,\n\u00f0a genam woden VIIII wuldortanas,\nsloh \u00f0a \u00fea n\u00e6ddran  \u00fe\u00e6t heo on VIIII tofleah\n\u00de\u00e6r ga\u00e6ndade   \u00e6ppel and attor\n\u00fe\u00e6t heo n\u00e6fre ne wolde on hus bugan.<ref name=\"GRIFFITHS-183\">Griffiths (2006 [2003]:183).</ref>\n|2= A serpent came crawling (but) it destroyed no one\nwhen Woden took nine twigs of glory,\n(and) then struck the adder so that it flew into nine (pieces).\nThere archived apple and poison\nthat it never would re-enter the house.<ref name=\"GRIFFITHS-183\"/>\n|attr2=Bill Griffiths translation\n}}\n\nThe emendation of {{lang|ang|nan}} to 'man' has been proposed. The next stanza comments on the creation of the herbs [[chervil]] and [[fennel]] while hanging in heaven by the 'wise lord' ({{lang|ang|witig drihten}}) and before sending them down among mankind. Regarding this, Griffith comments that \"In a Christian context 'hanging in heaven' would refer to [[crucifixion of Jesus|the crucifixion]]; but (remembering that Woden was mentioned a few lines previously) there is also a parallel, perhaps a better one, with Odin, as his crucifixion was associated with learning.\"<ref name=\"GRIFFITHS-183\"/> The Old English gnomic poem ''[[Maxims (Old English poems)|Maxims I]]'' also mentions Odin by name in the (alliterative) phrase {{lang|ang|Woden worhte [[v\u00e9 (shrine)|weos]]}}, ('Woden made idols'), in which he is contrasted with and denounced against the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]].<ref name=\"MAXIMS-I\">North (1997:88).</ref>\n\n[[File:Runic letter os.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|The Old English rune {{lang|ang|\u00f3s}}, which is described in the Old English rune poem]]\n\nThe Old English rune poem is a [[rune poems|rune poem]] that recounts the Old English runic alphabet, the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]].

Due to this and the content of the stanzas, several scholars have posited that this poem is censored, having originally referred to Odin.<ref name=\"OE-RUNE-ODIN\">For example, Herbert (2007 [1994]:33), Pollington (2008 [1995]:18).</ref> [[Kathleen Herbert]] comments that \"{{lang|ang|Os}} was cognate with {{lang|non|As}} in Norse, where it meant one of the {{lang|non|[[\u00c6sir]]|italic=no}}, the chief family of gods. In Old English, it could be used as an element in first names: Osric, Oswald, Osmund, etc. but it was not used as a word to refer to the God of Christians. Woden was equated with Mercury, the god of eloquence (among other things). The tales about the Norse god Odin tell how he gave one of his eyes in return for wisdom; he also won the mead of poetic inspiration. Luckily for Christian rune-masters, the Latin word {{lang|la|os}} could be substituted without ruining the sense, to keep the outward form of the rune name without obviously referring to Woden.\"<ref name=\"HERBERT-33\">Herbert (2007 [1994]:33).</ref>\n\nIn the poem ''Solomon and Saturn'', \"Mercurius the Giant\" ({{lang|ang|Mercurius se gygand}}) is referred to as an inventor of letters.

According to this legend, a \"small people\" known as the {{lang|la|[[Winnili]]}} were ruled by a woman named [[Gambara (Lombard)|Gambara]] who had two sons, [[Ybor and Aio]]. The [[Vandals]], ruled by [[Ambri and Assi]], came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Aio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute.

At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him.

It was the custom there that twelve temple priests were ranked highest; they administered sacrifices and held judgements over men. \"Called {{lang|non|diar}} or chiefs\", the people were obliged to serve under them and respect them. Odin was a very successful warrior and travelled widely, conquering many lands. Odin was so successful that he never lost a battle. As a result, according to the saga, men came to believe that \"it was granted to him\" to win all battles. Before Odin sent his men to war or to perform tasks for him, he would place his hands upon their heads and give them a {{lang|non|bjannak}} ('blessing', ultimately from Latin {{lang|la|benedictio}}) and the men would believe that they would also prevail. The men placed all of their faith in Odin, and wherever they called his name they would receive assistance from doing so. Odin was often gone for great spans of time.{{sfnp|Hollander|1964|p=7}}\n\nChapter 3 says that Odin had two brothers, [[Vili and V\u00e9|V\u00e9 and Vili]].

According to the chapter, Odin \"made war on the {{lang|non|Vanir|italic=no}}\". The {{lang|non|Vanir|italic=no}} defended their land and the battle turned to a stalemate, both sides having devastated one another's lands. As part of a peace agreement, the two sides exchanged hostages.

Thorpe notes that, in {{lang|sv|[[Blekinge]]|italic=no}} in Sweden, \"it was formerly the custom to leave a sheaf on the field for Odin's horses\", and cites other examples, such as in {{lang|sv|Kr\u00e5ktorpsg\u00e5rd|italic=no}}, {{lang|sv|[[Sm\u00e5land]]|italic=no}}, where a [[tumulus|barrow]] was purported to have been opened in the 18th century, purportedly containing the body of Odin. After Christianization, the mound was known as {{lang|sv|Helvetesbackke}} (Swedish \"Hell's Mound\"). Local legend dictates that after it was opened, \"there burst forth a wondrous fire, like a flash of lightning\", and that a coffin full of flint and a lamp were excavated. Thorpe additionally relates that legend has it that a priest who dwelt around {{lang|sv|Troienborg|italic=no}} had once sowed some rye, and that when the rye sprang up, so came Odin riding from the hills each evening. Odin was so massive that he towered over the farm-yard buildings, spear in hand.

The back of each bird features a mask-motif, and the feet of the birds are shaped like the heads of animals. The feathers of the birds are also composed of animal-heads.

Davidson proposes further connections between Odin's role as bringer of [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] by way of the etymology of the god's name.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=147}}\n\n==Origin, theories, and interpretation==\nBeginning with Henry Petersen's doctoral dissertation in 1876, which proposed that [[Thor]] was the indigenous god of Scandinavian farmers and Odin a later god proper to chieftains and poets, many scholars of Norse mythology in the past viewed Odin as having been imported from elsewhere. The idea was developed by [[Bernhard Salin]] on the basis of motifs in the [[petroglyph]]s and [[bracteate]]s, and with reference to the Prologue of the ''Prose Edda'', which presents the \u00c6sir as having migrated into Scandinavia. Salin proposed that both Odin and the [[runes]] were introduced from [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]] in the [[Iron Age]]. Other scholars placed his introduction at different times; [[Axel Olrik]], during the [[Migration Age]] as a result of [[Gauls|Gaulish]] influence.{{sfn|Vries|1970b|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nMore radically, both the archaeologist and comparative mythologist {{lang|lt|[[Marija Gimbutas]]|italic=no}} and the Germanicist [[Karl Helm]] argued that the {{lang|non|\u00c6sir|italic=no}} as a group, which includes both Thor and Odin, were late introductions into [[Northern Europe]] and that the indigenous religion of the region had been {{lang|non|[[Vanir|Vanic]]|italic=no}}.{{sfn|Polom\u00e9|1970|p=60}}{{sfn|Gimbutas|Robbins Dexter|1999|p=191}}\n\nIn the 16th century and by the entire [[Vasa dynasty]], Odin (as {{lang|sv|Oden}}) was officially considered the first King of Sweden by that country's government and historians. This was based on an embellished list of rulers invented by [[Johannes Magnus]] and adopted as fact in the reign of King [[Charles IX of Sweden|Carl IX]], who, though numbered accordingly, actually was only Carl III.<ref>Erik Pettersson in ''Den skoningsl\u00f6se, en biografi \u00f6ver Karl IX'' [[Natur & Kultur]] 2008 {{ISBN|978-91-27-02687-2}} pp. 13 & 24</ref>\n\nUnder the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] of {{lang|fr|Georges Dum\u00e9zil|italic=no}}, Odin is assigned one of the core functions in the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European pantheon]] as a representative of the first function (sovereignty) corresponding to the Hindu {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Varu\u1e47a]]|italic=no}} (fury and magic) as opposed to {{lang|non|T\u00fdr|italic=no}}, who corresponds to the Hindu {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitr\u00e1]]|italic=no}} (law and justice); while the {{lang|non|Vanir|italic=no}} represent the third function (fertility).{{sfn|Turville-Petre|1964|p=103}}{{sfn|Polom\u00e9|1970|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nAnother approach to Odin has been in terms of his function and attributes. Many early scholars interpreted him as a wind-god or especially as a death-god.{{sfn|Vries|1970b|p=93}} He has also been interpreted in the light of his association with ecstatic practices, and [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] compared him to the Hindu god [[Rudra]] and the Greek [[Hermes]].{{sfn|Vries|1970b|pp=94\u201397}}\n\n==Modern influence==\n\nOdin is often mentioned as one of the early inspirations for modern European and US Christmas traditions (see [[Santa Claus#Germanic paganism, Wodan, and Christianization|Santa Claus]]).<ref>[https://www.norwegianamerican.com/featured/dont-take-odin-out-of-yule/ The Norwegian American \u2013 Don't take the Odin out of Yule]</ref><ref>[https://vahistorymuseum.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/12-days-of-christmas-traditions-cookies-for-santa/ History Museum of Western Virginia \u2013 12 Days of Christmas Traditions]</ref>\n\n[[File:Wotan takes leave of Brunhild (1892) by Konrad Dielitz.jpg|thumb|upright|''Wotan takes leave of Brunhild'' (1892) by {{lang|de|[[Konrad Dielitz]]|italic=no}}]]\nThe god Odin has been a source of inspiration for artists working in fine art, literature, and music.

She returned full-time on 27 June 2017.\n\nSonia has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, teenage pregnancy and a cancer scare. In 2000, Sonia discovers that she is pregnant at 15 and gives birth to a daughter [[Rebecca Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]) whom she puts up for adoption. She begins a relationship with [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]) who is later killed on Christmas Day 2002. Sonia is known for her problematic marriage with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]/[[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]), which ends in 2006 when Sonia begins an affair with nurse [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]). The pair eventually reconcile for their daughter Rebecca, however Sonia begins a feud with Martin's mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) which ends when Pauline is murdered. Sonia is originally arrested for her murder, however, Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]) is her murderer.\n\nSince her return in 2014, Sonia's storyline has included divorcing Martin, coming out as [[bisexual]], a cancer scare, relationships with [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]) and  [[Gethin Pryce]] ([[Cerith Flinn]]), supporting Bex through her attempted suicide, feelings for her ex-husband Martin returning, and stealing money from Dot to help pay off Martin's hit-and-run victim who had been blackmailing her.\n\n==Storylines==\n===1993\u20132007=== \nSonia and her family move to [[Albert Square]]. She is the third of [[Carol Jackson]]'s ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) four children and the result of her mother's relationship with Terry Cant, whom Sonia never knew and who was [[domestic violence|violent]] towards Carol. During her childhood, she becomes close friends with [[Clare Bates|Clare Tyler]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]) and the two are inseparable until Clare falls in with the wrong crowd at school and starts bullying Sonia but they reconcile before Clare leaves in 1998. Sonia has sex with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]) but starts dating [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]). Not knowing she is pregnant, Sonia goes into labour and gives birth to Martin's daughter. Baby [[Bex Fowler|Chloe]] is subsequently given up for adoption and renamed Rebecca, despite protests from Martin's mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). However, Sonia becomes obsessed with her daughter and abducts her, locking herself in her house with the baby. Despite pleas from Rebecca's adoptive parents, it is Sonia's step-grandmother, [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]), who persuades Sonia to return the baby.\n\nSonia and Jamie get engaged, but due to Jamie's fling with [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) and constant rowing, the relationship ends. Sonia dates [[Gus Smith]] ([[Mohammed George]]), who plans to propose, but he is devastated when Sonia reconciles with Jamie after he is brutally assaulted by his godfather [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Sonia helps him, nursing him through his injuries and they decide to marry but their happiness is short-lived as Martin accidentally hits Jamie with his vehicle. Sonia keeps a bedside vigil and is with Jamie when he dies.\n\nSonia eventually forgives Martin and as they grow closer, they fall in love and eventually elope. Sonia begins nursing training and she and Martin live with Pauline but struggle to cope with her interference. Martin gets unwittingly involved with a stalker, [[Sarah Cairns]] ([[Alison Pargeter]]), who tries to ruin his marriage. This culminates in Sarah holding Sonia and Martin hostage and stabbing Martin, until Sonia knocks her unconscious. Sonia and Martin face further upset when they discover that their daughter's adoptive parents have died in a car crash. They visit Rebecca's ([[Jade Sharif]]) guardian, [[Margaret Wilson (EastEnders)|Margaret Wilson]] ([[Janet Amsden]]), hiding their true identity but when Margaret realises who they are, she asks them to leave. Pauline also interferes and visits Rebecca with Martin. Sonia is furious when she learns this and animosity in the Fowlers' home puts a strain on Martin and Sonia's relationship so she spends her time with a colleague, [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]); feelings develop and they begin an affair. Martin is heartbroken when his marriage ends and the situation is complicated further by Rebecca, who, on Margaret's request, is spending more time at the Fowlers'. Margaret decides to make the Fowlers' Rebecca's legal guardians but does not include Sonia when she finds out about her lesbian fling. Margaret dies and Martin takes custody of Rebecca and Pauline tries to stop Sonia having any contact with Rebecca. This makes Sonia distraught and preoccupied with Rebecca. Feeling neglected, Naomi ends their relationship.\n\nSonia becomes depressed and begins to neglect her work and drink alcohol, until Gus helps her straighten her life out. Sonia and Gus begin a second romance, which ends due to Sonia's lingering feelings for Martin. Sonia and Martin receive their divorce papers. However, both regret getting divorced and they reconcile. Pauline eventually finds out and tells Martin that she is dying from a brain tumour to stop him moving in with Sonia. Just as Pauline intends, Martin ends his relationship with Sonia in order to care for her, but when the truth finally comes out, a furious Martin moves out anyway. Pauline responds with ire, threatening to cut her son from her life. Sonia tries to build bridges with Pauline but an argument ends with Sonia slapping Pauline. When Pauline is found dead later that day, Sonia fears that she caused her death. She discovers that Rebecca witnessed the slap and tries to silence her daughter, but Rebecca tells Dot at Pauline's funeral. Appalled, Martin refuses Sonia access to Rebecca. Fearing imprisonment Sonia goes [[wiktionary:on the run|on the run]], abducting Rebecca. Martin is frantic, but days later Sonia returns and she is arrested on a murder charge; however, that night Dot uncovers the identity of Pauline's real murderer \u2014 Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]), who had argued with Pauline on Christmas Day and struck her over the head, causing her death. Sonia is released and decides to leave Walford for Manchester. After making peace with Martin, she takes a taxi and is about to leave Walford when she sees Martin and Rebecca obstructing the road; Martin has decided that he wants to go with Sonia. The Fowlers reunite and leave as a family. They spend time touring the USA before settling in Manchester.\n\n===2010\u20132011===\nBianca invites Sonia to her wedding to Ricky and Sonia attends alone. She rejects a phone call from Martin and gets very drunk. The following day, Sonia walks in on Dot slapping her granddaughter [[Dotty Cotton]] ([[Molly Conlin]]) across the legs, leading to Dot's arrest, though she is released without charge. Bianca notices Sonia has continuously avoided talking about Martin and Rebecca. Sonia visits Jamie's grave and later returns to [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, and drunkenly berates Phil, Jamie's godfather, about his treatment of Jamie. Phil says he considers Jamie to be one of his own children and tells Sonia to go upstairs to sober up. She misunderstands him and gets into his bed, naked. As Phil sees Sonia in bed, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) walks in and slaps Phil across the face. Sonia confides in Carol about her marriage problems and Carol advises her to try to stay together for Rebecca's sake. After Ricky and Bianca's wedding, Sonia decides she must make a fresh start with Martin and leaves again. However, it is later revealed that Sonia and Martin are no longer together.\n\n===2014\u2013===\nIn January 2014, Carol informs Sonia, who is having marital problems with Martin again, about her [[breast cancer]] diagnosis. Carol has the [[BRCA gene]] and Sonia finds out she has inherited it. Sonia kisses [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), which Tina's girlfriend, [[Fiona \"Tosh\" Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs), finds out about, so Tina end her friendship with Sonia to protect her relationship. Sonia, who has started a weight loss class, arranges to have a [[gastric band]] in [[Bulgaria]], telling friends and family she is on a course. When she returns, she tries to confess to her class but collapses before she can do so. Sonia and Martin (now played by [[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) separate and Sonia starts to feel isolated and depressed. Sonia is supported by Tina but Sonia backs away when Tina goes to kiss her as Sonia is unsure of her feelings.\n\nMartin moves back into the area and Rebecca (now played by [[Jasmine Armfield]]) moves in with him, as she resents Sonia for leaving Martin. Martin believes he can repair his marriage, but Tina and Sonia share a kiss, which Martin sees. He tells everyone in The Vic about Sonia and Tina, but Sonia ends their relationship. Martin sends Rebecca, who now wants to be called Bex, to live with Sonia so she can spend more time with her mother. Sonia also repairs her relationship with Tina. Martin moves in with [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), while Sonia and Tina embark on a full relationship. Sonia and Martin's divorce is finalised. After Tina drunkenly humiliates Sonia at an awards ceremony and Sonia rejects her, Tina has sex with [[Sophie Dodd]] ([[Poppy Rush]]) and regrets it, but before she can tell Sonia, Sonia reveals she has found a lump in her breast. Sonia forgives Tina for the humiliation, but Sophie tells Sonia that Tina cheated and their relationship ends, but they soon reunite. After having her breast lump checked, Sonia is given the all-clear.\n\nSonia receives a lucrative job offer at a private hospital in Kettering and, having realised she no longer loves Tina, ends their relationship. Bex is furious and thinks Sonia is abandoning her. Bex later calms down and she says an emotional farewell. Several months later, following [[Madison Drake]] (Seraphina Beh), [[Alexandra D'Costa]] (Sydney Craven) and her former friend [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) continuously bullying Bex, Sonia returns after Bex phones her in tears. Sonia accuses Martin and Stacey of not caring about Bex and tells Martin she wants Bex to live with her. Sonia meets Bex's teachers before returning to Kettering. Sonia returns to Walford and lets herself into Dot's house, finding Dot on the floor after tripping. Sonia and Robbie, who has also returned, move in with Dot to help care for her. It is revealed that Sonia is hiding a secret from her time in Kettering meaning she no longer wants to return there. Although Sonia wants Bex to move in with them, Bex chooses to stay with Martin and Stacey.\n\nSonia starts dating Bex's teacher [[Gethin Pryce]] ([[Cerith Flinn]]) but is unaware that Bex is infatuated with him. Bex and Gethin kiss and after Bex's attempts to pursue him and he eventually confesses to Sonia. Gethin subsequently resigns his job at the school and leaves Walford, and Sonia tells Bex that she has done nothing wrong. In December 2017, Sonia discovers [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) having a miscarriage and supports her when she believes that she has left her husband [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) down. In January 2018, it is discovered that Stacey has slept with Max, which subsequently fractures Martin and Stacey's relationship. Stacey kicks Martin out and Sonia agrees for him to move into No. 25 with her and Bex. Sonia discovers that she may still be in love Martin and agrees to go on a date with him. However Martin still has feelings for Stacey, which upsets Sonia. When Bex decides that she doesn't want to go to university, Sonia pressures Bex into applying to [[Oxbridge University]], much to Bex's annoyance. Bex tells Sonia that she is feeling upset since her boyfriend [[Shakil Kazemi]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) was killed and that she isn't ready for university, and Sonia supports Bex's decision. Sonia and Dot care for [[Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) when he becomes ill and he moves into No.25. A swastika is graffitied on Dot's door which causes Dr Legg to fall into a panic attack. Sonia blames Dot's new lodger [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) for the attack and threatens to report him to the police if she comes anywhere near No. 25. However Stuart is innocent and the perpetrators behind the attack are young youths. Sonia's niece [[Tiffany Butcher]] ([[Maisie Smith]]) is involved in a drug ring and Sonia discovers this when [[Bernadette Taylor]] (Clair Norris) informs her. Sonia and the Brannings try to help Tiffany and promise to pay off the drug dealers that Tiffany and her friend [[Evie Steele]] (Sophia Capasso) owe money to, in order for Tiffany to stay. Tiffany discovers that Sonia is lying and attempts to leave, but Sonia stops her from leaving causing Tiffany to slap her. They lock Tiffany in and finally release her when she agrees to speak up about the drug ring.\n\nWhen Bex takes an [[overdose]], Sonia finds her and is dismayed when she realises it was a suicide attempt. She blames herself. Martin returns to Walford and Sonia is angry with Martin for being absent. She is forced to give him a false alibi when police question him about stolen vehicles and convinces him to tell the truth.  She forgives him but Martin's behaviour continues and he is injured during an attack so Sonia throws him out. She forgives him again and realises that she still has feelings for him. When Martin and [[Charlie \"Tubbs\" Savage]] ([[Tayla Kovacevic-Ebong]]) knock down [[List of EastEnders characters (2020)#George Watson|George Watson]] ([[Jack Bennett (actor)|Jack Bennett]]), Sonia visits George in hospital to question him about the [[hit-and-run]]. Upon realising Sonia and Martin are in a relationship, George [[blackmail]]s Sonia and threatens to report Martin to the police unless she gives him \u00a310,000.

Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. The family was created by writer [[Tony McHale]].<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\">{{cite book|author=Larry Jaffee|title=Albert Square & Me: The Actors of Eastenders|year=2009|publisher=iUniverse.com|isbn=978-1-4401-5987-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/albertsquareme00jaff}}</ref>\n\nVarious members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]]. Their slow introduction was a deliberate attempt by the programme makers to introduce the whole family over a long period.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The Jacksons have been described by ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] as a \"classic problem family\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nCassidy was 10 years old when she joined the soap as Sonia.<ref name=\"break\"/> She was spotted doing improvisations at the Anna Scher Theatre School by Tony McHale and ''EastEnders''' Casting Advisor Jane Deitch. They liked Cassidy and she was asked to audition at Elstree studios, after which she was offered the part. None of the actors cast as the Jackson family were matched for appearance or screen compatibility. Cassidy commented, \"it was all decided without doing that. I don't think it particularly mattered that none of us Jackson kids looked like each other because all our characters had different dads!\"<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\n==Development==\nEarly on in the character's narrative, Sonia was given a trumpet to play, which she did badly, infuriating her family and neighbours. According to Cassidy, this was on the behest of Storyliner and future Executive Producer of ''EastEnders'', [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]]. Cassidy revealed that she took lessons to play the trumpet, but that when she began to play well, she was asked by the producers to pretend to play it badly as Sonia was supposed to be playing it badly.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/> Other storylines included a period where Sonia was bullied by her friend [[Clare Bates]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]) after she fell in with the wrong crowd at school. Despite the bullying storyline, Cassidy said that she and Bissix were good friends during their time together on the soap.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the actress who played Sonia's mother Carol decided to quit ''EastEnders''. It was at this stage that the producers made a decision to write the majority of the Jackson family out. Cassidy commented, \"I thought I was out of a job [on ''EastEnders''] forever!\". Cassidy made several temporary returns on-screen months later to visit Clare or Bianca, but she was still uncertain about the future of her character: \"I didn't come back to the show for about four months or so after [ I was written out in 1997]. And after Clare left the Square [in 1998] I was gone for another eight months. I just got on with school and all that\". However, later in 1998 the producers asked Cassidy to return to the serial full-time, which she said she was \"thrilled\" about.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\n===Departure (2007)===\nIn April 2006, it was announced that Cassidy would take a break from ''EastEnders'', saying \"it's time to try new things. But it doesn't mean Sonia won't be back\".<ref name=\"break\"/> A BBC spokesperson added, \"Natalie is a valued member of the ''EastEnders'' cast and we wish her all the very best during her break from the show\".<ref name=\"break\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4895214.stm|title=Cassidy set for EastEnders break |date=10 April 2006|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> Sonia departed on screen in February 2007, along with her former husband Martin, as his actor, [[James Alexandrou]], also left the serial. Their departing storyline was the culmination of the death of [[Pauline Fowler]], following actress [[Wendy Richard]]'s high-profile resignation from the serial in 2006. In the storyline, Pauline dies in suspicious circumstances and Sonia is blamed for killing her, although Sonia is eventually vindicated when Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]) admits to manslaughter. Sonia and Martin and their daughter Rebecca leave Walford as a united family for the [[United States]]. In 2010, Cassidy said one of the reasons she decided to leave the show was because of Sonia's affair with [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]), saying it was wrong for the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a197691/natalie-cassidy-bemoans-lesbian-storyline.html|title=Natalie Cassidy bemoans lesbian storyline|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Paul|last=Millar|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite Cassidy's departure being specified as a \"break\", Cassidy commented in 2008, \"I feel that door's closed now and I need to go and do other stuff [...] Maybe in nine years I might go back.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a89852/natalie-cassidy-misses-patsy-palmer.html|title=Natalie Cassidy misses Patsy Palmer|date=21 February 2008|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> More recently, in 2009, press reports suggested that the actress was keen to reprise the role.

The characters would reunite with Bianca who returned in 2008. Cassidy is quoted as saying \"To be invited back to ''EastEnders'' is such an honour and I am very, very excited that Sonia is coming back. For me, to be reunited with the original Jacksons is a dream come true and I think it will be a fantastic storyline.\"<ref name=\"2010return\"/> A source told entertainment website [[Digital Spy]]: \"Everything's being kept hush-hush about the Jacksons' return at the moment, but there are certainly a load of questions to be answered.

Everyone's so pleased to have them back.\"<ref name=\"2010return\"/> The family returned for Bianca's second wedding to [[Ricky Butcher]] as part of the show's 25th anniversary.

Sharon Hadrian writes: \"It was the first time in over a decade that a lesbian couple had been depicted in the East London drama, lending cautious optimism to the idea that the BBC was finally integrating its traditionally heterosexual soaps [...] Lesbian fans, meanwhile, are struggling to care at all after being led on by the show's failed attempts at writing a decent lesbian story line [...]  Despite their troubles, Martin and Sonia got married in 2004 and \u2014 given their past \u2014 many fans believe they are meant to be together. If this seems like the most inopportune time to turn Sonia into a lesbian, well, the show's writers did it anyway [...]  Sonia's sudden lesbian affair was met with disapproval from all sides, and nobody \u2014 the fans, characters or even the actors \u2014 was particularly supportive of her relationship. As a result, perhaps, the writers wrote what was expected of them [...] there was hardly room in the script for any affection or sympathy at all; instead, their relationship was written around its impact on Martin and the other Albert Square residents. The reaction of Rebecca's guardian, Margaret, was especially hurtful. When the [lesbian] relationship became public, she immediately sought to award sole custody of Rebecca to Martin, citing Sonia's sexual orientation as the reason she would be an unfit mother. This vitriolic response to Sonia and Naomi's relationship could have been a pivotal moment had the program's producers used the opportunity to prove either the quality of their relationship or to reinforce Sonia's parenting abilities. Unfortunately, they did neither of these things. Instead, Margaret's reaction was surprisingly representative of the public response to their relationship. Fans of the show were upset that anyone (let alone a lesbian) had come between Sonia and Martin. Naomi came off looking especially predatory \u2014 a common trait in media representations of gay and lesbian characters \u2014 by seducing a formerly heterosexual woman and convincing her to leave her family [...] not too surprisingly, Naomi and Sonia broke up. Afterward, Naomi faded into the background and Sonia ended up back with Martin, seeming to forget entirely about the same-sex attractions she once had [...] It was a sad but not unexpected ending to a rare chance for the BBC to acknowledge lesbian sexuality in its programming and for viewers to witness a positive lesbian relationship that didn't ruin anybody's life [...] Sonia or Naomi [...] had the potential to develop a loving depiction of lesbian sexuality but were failed by the show's writers and, arguably, the BBC's institutionalized homophobia\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/3/eastenders?page=0%2C1|title=No More Lesbians on \"EastEnders\"|date=28 February 2007|work=[[AfterEllen.com]]|accessdate=18 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306075547/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/3/eastenders?page=0%2C1|archivedate=6 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of EastEnders characters (1993)|List of ''EastEnders'' characters (1993)]]\n*[[List of media portrayals of bisexuality]]\n*[[List of LGBT characters in television and radio]]\n*[[List of fictional nurses]]\n*[[List of soap opera villains]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{EastEnders character external link|sonia-jackson}}\n\n{{EastEnders characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fowler, Sonia}}\n[[Category:EastEnders characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional nurses]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual females]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional waiting staff]]\n[[Category:Fictional teenage parents]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n[[Category:Beale family (EastEnders)]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional thieves]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Fictional character from the British soap opera EastEnders}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=EastEnders\n|image=Sonia fowler22.jpg\n|imagesize=200px\n|name=Sonia Fowler\n|caption=<!-- A caption is not needed unless the character has been portrayed by more than one actress -->\n|portrayer=[[Natalie Cassidy]]\n|years=1993\u20132007, 2010\u20132011, 2014\u2013\n|first=Episode 922<br/>{{start date|1993|12|2|df=y}}\n|last=  \n|introducer={{plainlist|\n*{{nowrap|[[Leonard Lewis]] (1993)}}\n*{{nowrap|[[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] (1998)}}\n*{{nowrap|[[Diederick Santer]] (2010)}}\n*{{nowrap|[[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] (2011)}}\n*{{nowrap|[[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] (2014)}}}}\n|creator=[[Tony McHale]]\n|spinoffs = ''EastEnders: The Podcast'' (2019)\n|occupation=Nurse<br />Caf\u00e9 worker<br> Student\n|classification=[[List of EastEnders characters#Present characters|Present; regular]]\n|family= [[Jackson family (EastEnders)|Jackson]]/[[Fowler family|Fowler]]\n|father = Terry Cant\n|mother = [[Carol Jackson]]\n|stepfather = [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]]\n|halfsisters=[[Bianca Jackson]]\n|halfbrothers=[[Robbie Jackson]]<br />[[Billie Jackson]]\n|husband= [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] (2004\u20132006, 2007\u20132015)\n|daughters= [[Bex Fowler]]\n|grandfathers=[[Jim Branning]]\n|grandmothers=[[Reenie Branning]]\n|aunts=[[April Branning]]<br />[[Suzy Branning]]\n|uncles=[[Derek Branning]]<br />[[Max Branning]]<br />[[Jack Branning]]\n|nephews= [[Liam Butcher]]<br> [[Morgan Butcher]]<br />[[Sami Jackson]]\n|nieces=[[Tiffany Butcher]]\n|cousins=[[Bradley Branning]]<br>[[Lauren Branning]]<br>[[Abi Branning]]\n}}\n\n'''Sonia Fowler''' (also '''Jackson''')<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/crew/interviews/interview_content/interview_helpdesk.shtml Helpdesk]\", ''BBC'.'

She returned full-time on 27 June 2017.\n\nSonia has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, teenage pregnancy and a cancer scare. In 2000, Sonia discovers that she is pregnant at 15 and gives birth to a daughter [[Rebecca Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]) whom she puts up for adoption. She begins a relationship with [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]) who is later killed on Christmas Day 2002. Sonia is known for her problematic marriage with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]/[[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]), which ends in 2006 when Sonia begins an affair with nurse [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]). The pair eventually reconcile for their daughter Rebecca, however Sonia begins a feud with Martin's mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) which ends when Pauline is murdered. Sonia is originally arrested for her murder, however, Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]) is her murderer.\n\nSince her return in 2014, Sonia's storyline has included divorcing Martin, coming out as [[bisexual]], a cancer scare, relationships with [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]) and  [[Gethin Pryce]] ([[Cerith Flinn]]), supporting Bex through her attempted suicide, feelings for her ex-husband Martin returning, and stealing money from Dot to help pay off Martin\u2019s hit-and-run victim who had been blackmailing her.\n\n==Storylines==\n===1993\u20132007=== \nSonia and her family move to [[Albert Square]]. She is the third of [[Carol Jackson]]'s ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) four children and the result of her mother's relationship with Terry Cant, whom Sonia never knew and who was [[domestic violence|violent]] towards Carol. During her childhood, she becomes close friends with [[Clare Bates|Clare Tyler]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]) and the two are inseparable until Clare falls in with the wrong crowd at school and starts bullying Sonia but they reconcile before Clare leaves in 1998. Sonia has sex with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]) but starts dating [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]). Not knowing she is pregnant, Sonia goes into labour and gives birth to Martin's daughter. Baby [[Bex Fowler|Chloe]] is subsequently given up for adoption and renamed Rebecca, despite protests from Martin's mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). However, Sonia becomes obsessed with her daughter and abducts her, locking herself in her house with the baby. Despite pleas from Rebecca's adoptive parents, it is Sonia's step-grandmother, [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]), who persuades Sonia to return the baby.\n\nSonia and Jamie get engaged, but due to Jamie's fling with [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) and constant rowing, the relationship ends. Sonia dates [[Gus Smith]] ([[Mohammed George]]), who plans to propose, but he is devastated when Sonia reconciles with Jamie after he is brutally assaulted by his godfather [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Sonia helps him, nursing him through his injuries and they decide to marry but their happiness is short-lived as Martin accidentally hits Jamie with his vehicle. Sonia keeps a bedside vigil and is with Jamie when he dies.\n\nSonia eventually forgives Martin and as they grow closer, they fall in love and eventually elope. Sonia begins nursing training and she and Martin live with Pauline but struggle to cope with her interference. Martin gets unwittingly involved with a stalker, [[Sarah Cairns]] ([[Alison Pargeter]]), who tries to ruin his marriage. This culminates in Sarah holding Sonia and Martin hostage and stabbing Martin, until Sonia knocks her unconscious. Sonia and Martin face further upset when they discover that their daughter's adoptive parents have died in a car crash. They visit Rebecca's ([[Jade Sharif]]) guardian, [[Margaret Wilson (EastEnders)|Margaret Wilson]] ([[Janet Amsden]]), hiding their true identity but when Margaret realises who they are, she asks them to leave. Pauline also interferes and visits Rebecca with Martin. Sonia is furious when she learns this and animosity in the Fowlers' home puts a strain on Martin and Sonia's relationship so she spends her time with a colleague, [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]); feelings develop and they begin an affair. Martin is heartbroken when his marriage ends and the situation is complicated further by Rebecca, who, on Margaret's request, is spending more time at the Fowlers'. Margaret decides to make the Fowlers' Rebecca's legal guardians but does not include Sonia when she finds out about her lesbian fling. Margaret dies and Martin takes custody of Rebecca and Pauline tries to stop Sonia having any contact with Rebecca. This makes Sonia distraught and preoccupied with Rebecca. Feeling neglected, Naomi ends their relationship.\n\nSonia becomes depressed and begins to neglect her work and drink alcohol, until Gus helps her straighten her life out. Sonia and Gus begin a second romance, which ends due to Sonia's lingering feelings for Martin. Sonia and Martin receive their divorce papers. However, both regret getting divorced and they reconcile. Pauline eventually finds out and tells Martin that she is dying from a brain tumour to stop him moving in with Sonia. Just as Pauline intends, Martin ends his relationship with Sonia in order to care for her, but when the truth finally comes out, a furious Martin moves out anyway. Pauline responds with ire, threatening to cut her son from her life. Sonia tries to build bridges with Pauline but an argument ends with Sonia slapping Pauline. When Pauline is found dead later that day, Sonia fears that she caused her death. She discovers that Rebecca witnessed the slap and tries to silence her daughter, but Rebecca tells Dot at Pauline's funeral. Appalled, Martin refuses Sonia access to Rebecca. Fearing imprisonment Sonia goes [[wiktionary:on the run|on the run]], abducting Rebecca. Martin is frantic, but days later Sonia returns and she is arrested on a murder charge; however, that night Dot uncovers the identity of Pauline's real murderer \u2014 Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]), who had argued with Pauline on Christmas Day and struck her over the head, causing her death. Sonia is released and decides to leave Walford for Manchester. After making peace with Martin, she takes a taxi and is about to leave Walford when she sees Martin and Rebecca obstructing the road; Martin has decided that he wants to go with Sonia. The Fowlers reunite and leave as a family. They spend time touring the USA before settling in Manchester.\n\n===2010\u20132011===\nBianca invites Sonia to her wedding to Ricky and Sonia attends alone. She rejects a phone call from Martin and gets very drunk. The following day, Sonia walks in on Dot slapping her granddaughter [[Dotty Cotton]] ([[Molly Conlin]]) across the legs, leading to Dot's arrest, though she is released without charge. Bianca notices Sonia has continuously avoided talking about Martin and Rebecca. Sonia visits Jamie's grave and later returns to [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, and drunkenly berates Phil, Jamie's godfather, about his treatment of Jamie. Phil says he considers Jamie to be one of his own children and tells Sonia to go upstairs to sober up. She misunderstands him and gets into his bed, naked. As Phil sees Sonia in bed, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) walks in and slaps Phil across the face. Sonia confides in Carol about her marriage problems and Carol advises her to try to stay together for Rebecca's sake. After Ricky and Bianca's wedding, Sonia decides she must make a fresh start with Martin and leaves again. However, it is later revealed that Sonia and Martin are no longer together.\n\n===2014\u2013===\nIn January 2014, Carol informs Sonia, who is having marital problems with Martin again, about her [[breast cancer]] diagnosis. Carol has the [[BRCA gene]] and Sonia finds out she has inherited it. Sonia kisses [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), which Tina's girlfriend, [[Fiona \"Tosh\" Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs), finds out about, so Tina end her friendship with Sonia to protect her relationship. Sonia, who has started a weight loss class, arranges to have a [[gastric band]] in [[Bulgaria]], telling friends and family she is on a course. When she returns, she tries to confess to her class but collapses before she can do so. Sonia and Martin (now played by [[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) separate and Sonia starts to feel isolated and depressed. Sonia is supported by Tina but Sonia backs away when Tina goes to kiss her as Sonia is unsure of her feelings.\n\nMartin moves back into the area and Rebecca (now played by [[Jasmine Armfield]]) moves in with him, as she resents Sonia for leaving Martin. Martin believes he can repair his marriage, but Tina and Sonia share a kiss, which Martin sees. He tells everyone in The Vic about Sonia and Tina, but Sonia ends their relationship. Martin sends Rebecca, who now wants to be called Bex, to live with Sonia so she can spend more time with her mother. Sonia also repairs her relationship with Tina. Martin moves in with [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), while Sonia and Tina embark on a full relationship. Sonia and Martin's divorce is finalised. After Tina drunkenly humiliates Sonia at an awards ceremony and Sonia rejects her, Tina has sex with [[Sophie Dodd]] ([[Poppy Rush]]) and regrets it, but before she can tell Sonia, Sonia reveals she has found a lump in her breast. Sonia forgives Tina for the humiliation, but Sophie tells Sonia that Tina cheated and their relationship ends, but they soon reunite. After having her breast lump checked, Sonia is given the all-clear.\n\nSonia receives a lucrative job offer at a private hospital in Kettering and, having realised she no longer loves Tina, ends their relationship. Bex is furious and thinks Sonia is abandoning her. Bex later calms down and she says an emotional farewell. Several months later, following [[Madison Drake]] (Seraphina Beh), [[Alexandra D'Costa]] (Sydney Craven) and her former friend [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) continuously bullying Bex, Sonia returns after Bex phones her in tears. Sonia accuses Martin and Stacey of not caring about Bex and tells Martin she wants Bex to live with her. Sonia meets Bex's teachers before returning to Kettering. Sonia returns to Walford and lets herself into Dot's house, finding Dot on the floor after tripping. Sonia and Robbie, who has also returned, move in with Dot to help care for her. It is revealed that Sonia is hiding a secret from her time in Kettering meaning she no longer wants to return there. Although Sonia wants Bex to move in with them, Bex chooses to stay with Martin and Stacey.\n\nSonia starts dating Bex's teacher [[Gethin Pryce]] ([[Cerith Flinn]]) but is unaware that Bex is infatuated with him. Bex and Gethin kiss and after Bex's attempts to pursue him and he eventually confesses to Sonia. Gethin subsequently resigns his job at the school and leaves Walford, and Sonia tells Bex that she has done nothing wrong. In December 2017, Sonia discovers [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) having a miscarriage and supports her when she believes that she has left her husband [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) down. In January 2018, it is discovered that Stacey has slept with Max, which subsequently fractures Martin and Stacey's relationship. Stacey kicks Martin out and Sonia agrees for him to move into No. 25 with her and Bex. Sonia discovers that she may still be in love Martin and agrees to go on a date with him. However Martin still has feelings for Stacey, which upsets Sonia. When Bex decides that she doesn't want to go to university, Sonia pressures Bex into applying to [[Oxbridge University]], much to Bex's annoyance. Bex tells Sonia that she is feeling upset since her boyfriend [[Shakil Kazemi]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) was killed and that she isn't ready for university, and Sonia supports Bex's decision. Sonia and Dot care for [[Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) when he becomes ill and he moves into No.25. A swastika is graffitied on Dot's door which causes Dr Legg to fall into a panic attack. Sonia blames Dot's new lodger [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) for the attack and threatens to report him to the police if she comes anywhere near No. 25. However Stuart is innocent and the perpetrators behind the attack are young youths. Sonia's niece [[Tiffany Butcher]] ([[Maisie Smith]]) is involved in a drug ring and Sonia discovers this when [[Bernadette Taylor]] (Clair Norris) informs her. Sonia and the Brannings try to help Tiffany and promise to pay off the drug dealers that Tiffany and her friend [[Evie Steele]] (Sophia Capasso) owe money to, in order for Tiffany to stay. Tiffany discovers that Sonia is lying and attempts to leave, but Sonia stops her from leaving causing Tiffany to slap her. They lock Tiffany in and finally release her when she agrees to speak up about the drug ring.\n\nWhen Bex takes an [[overdose]], Sonia finds her and is dismayed when she realises it was a suicide attempt. She blames herself. Martin returns to Walford and Sonia is angry with Martin for being absent. She is forced to give him a false alibi when police question him about stolen vehicles and convinces him to tell the truth.  She forgives him but Martin's behaviour continues and he is injured during an attack so Sonia throws him out. She forgives him again and realises that she still has feelings for him. When Martin and [[Charlie \"Tubbs\" Savage]] ([[Tayla Kovacevic-Ebong]]) knock down [[List of EastEnders characters (2020)#George Watson|George Watson]] ([[Jack Bennett (actor)|Jack Bennett]]), Sonia visits George in hospital to question him about the [[hit-and-run]]. Upon realising Sonia and Martin are in a relationship, George [[blackmail]]s Sonia and threatens to report Martin to the police unless she gives him \u00a310,000.

Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. The family was created by writer [[Tony McHale]].<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\">{{cite book|author=Larry Jaffee|title=Albert Square & Me: The Actors of Eastenders|year=2009|publisher=iUniverse.com|isbn=978-1-4401-5987-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/albertsquareme00jaff}}</ref>\n\nVarious members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]]. Their slow introduction was a deliberate attempt by the programme makers to introduce the whole family over a long period.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The Jacksons have been described by ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] as a \"classic problem family\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nCassidy was 10 years old when she joined the soap as Sonia.<ref name=\"break\"/> She was spotted doing improvisations at the Anna Scher Theatre School by Tony McHale and ''EastEnders''' Casting Advisor Jane Deitch. They liked Cassidy and she was asked to audition at Elstree studios, after which she was offered the part. None of the actors cast as the Jackson family were matched for appearance or screen compatibility. Cassidy commented, \"it was all decided without doing that. I don't think it particularly mattered that none of us Jackson kids looked like each other because all our characters had different dads!\"<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\n==Development==\nEarly on in the character's narrative, Sonia was given a trumpet to play, which she did badly, infuriating her family and neighbours. According to Cassidy, this was on the behest of Storyliner and future Executive Producer of ''EastEnders'', [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]]. Cassidy revealed that she took lessons to play the trumpet, but that when she began to play well, she was asked by the producers to pretend to play it badly as Sonia was supposed to be playing it badly.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/> Other storylines included a period where Sonia was bullied by her friend [[Clare Bates]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]) after she fell in with the wrong crowd at school. Despite the bullying storyline, Cassidy said that she and Bissix were good friends during their time together on the soap.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the actress who played Sonia's mother Carol decided to quit ''EastEnders''. It was at this stage that the producers made a decision to write the majority of the Jackson family out. Cassidy commented, \"I thought I was out of a job [on ''EastEnders''] forever!\". Cassidy made several temporary returns on-screen months later to visit Clare or Bianca, but she was still uncertain about the future of her character: \"I didn't come back to the show for about four months or so after [ I was written out in 1997]. And after Clare left the Square [in 1998] I was gone for another eight months. I just got on with school and all that\".

In the storyline, Pauline dies in suspicious circumstances and Sonia is blamed for killing her, although Sonia is eventually vindicated when Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]) admits to manslaughter. Sonia and Martin and their daughter Rebecca leave Walford as a united family for the [[United States]]. In 2010, Cassidy said one of the reasons she decided to leave the show was because of Sonia's affair with [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]), saying it was wrong for the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a197691/natalie-cassidy-bemoans-lesbian-storyline.html|title=Natalie Cassidy bemoans lesbian storyline|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Paul|last=Millar|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite Cassidy's departure being specified as a \"break\", Cassidy commented in 2008, \"I feel that door's closed now and I need to go and do other stuff [...] Maybe in nine years I might go back.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a89852/natalie-cassidy-misses-patsy-palmer.html|title=Natalie Cassidy misses Patsy Palmer|date=21 February 2008|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> More recently, in 2009, press reports suggested that the actress was keen to reprise the role.

Sharon Hadrian writes: \"It was the first time in over a decade that a lesbian couple had been depicted in the East London drama, lending cautious optimism to the idea that the BBC was finally integrating its traditionally heterosexual soaps [...] Lesbian fans, meanwhile, are struggling to care at all after being led on by the show's failed attempts at writing a decent lesbian story line [...]  Despite their troubles, Martin and Sonia got married in 2004 and \u2014 given their past \u2014 many fans believe they are meant to be together. If this seems like the most inopportune time to turn Sonia into a lesbian, well, the show's writers did it anyway [...]  Sonia's sudden lesbian affair was met with disapproval from all sides, and nobody \u2014 the fans, characters or even the actors \u2014 was particularly supportive of her relationship. As a result, perhaps, the writers wrote what was expected of them [...] there was hardly room in the script for any affection or sympathy at all; instead, their relationship was written around its impact on Martin and the other Albert Square residents. The reaction of Rebecca's guardian, Margaret, was especially hurtful. When the [lesbian] relationship became public, she immediately sought to award sole custody of Rebecca to Martin, citing Sonia's sexual orientation as the reason she would be an unfit mother. This vitriolic response to Sonia and Naomi's relationship could have been a pivotal moment had the program's producers used the opportunity to prove either the quality of their relationship or to reinforce Sonia's parenting abilities. Unfortunately, they did neither of these things. Instead, Margaret's reaction was surprisingly representative of the public response to their relationship. Fans of the show were upset that anyone (let alone a lesbian) had come between Sonia and Martin. Naomi came off looking especially predatory \u2014 a common trait in media representations of gay and lesbian characters \u2014 by seducing a formerly heterosexual woman and convincing her to leave her family [...] not too surprisingly, Naomi and Sonia broke up. Afterward, Naomi faded into the background and Sonia ended up back with Martin, seeming to forget entirely about the same-sex attractions she once had [...] It was a sad but not unexpected ending to a rare chance for the BBC to acknowledge lesbian sexuality in its programming and for viewers to witness a positive lesbian relationship that didn't ruin anybody's life [...] Sonia or Naomi [...] had the potential to develop a loving depiction of lesbian sexuality but were failed by the show's writers and, arguably, the BBC's institutionalized homophobia\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/3/eastenders?page=0%2C1|title=No More Lesbians on \"EastEnders\"|date=28 February 2007|work=[[AfterEllen.com]]|accessdate=18 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306075547/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/3/eastenders?page=0%2C1|archivedate=6 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of EastEnders characters (1993)|List of ''EastEnders'' characters (1993)]]\n*[[List of media portrayals of bisexuality]]\n*[[List of LGBT characters in television and radio]]\n*[[List of fictional nurses]]\n*[[List of soap opera villains]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{EastEnders character external link|sonia-jackson}}\n\n{{EastEnders characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fowler, Sonia}}\n[[Category:EastEnders characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional nurses]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual females]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional waiting staff]]\n[[Category:Fictional teenage parents]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n[[Category:Beale family (EastEnders)]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional thieves]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Fowler"}
