Beginning in the mid-19th century, aside from the work being done by women for broad-based economic and political equality and for social reforms, women sought to change voting laws to allow them to vote.<ref>[[History of Woman Suffrage]]</ref> National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards that objective, especially the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (founded in 1904 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]), as well as for equal civil rights for women.<ref>Allison Sneider,  \"The New Suffrage History: Voting Rights in International Perspective\", ''History Compass,'' (July 2010) 8#7 pp. 692\u2013703,</ref>\n\nWomen who owned property gained the right to vote in the [[Isle of Man]] in 1881, and in 1893, women in the then British [[colony of New Zealand]] were granted the right to vote. In Australia, women progressively gained the right to vote between 1894 and 1911 (federally in 1902).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Australia and New Zealand|last=Christine.|first=Lindop|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-423390-3|location=Oxford|page=27|oclc=361237847}}</ref> Most major Western powers extended voting rights to women in the interwar period, including Canada (1917), Britain and Germany (1918), Austria and the Netherlands (1919) and the United States (1920). Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (1952), and Switzerland (1971).\n\n[[Leslie P. Hume|Leslie Hume]] argues that the First World War changed the popular mood:\n\n: The women's contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Hume|title=The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies 1897\u20131914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1TlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT281|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=281|isbn=978-1-317-21326-0 }}</ref>\n\nExtended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before [[universal suffrage]] for men; for instance, literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it. The [[United Nations]] encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (1979) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this Convention.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:AnnaIIStolQued.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Anna II, Abbess of Quedlinburg]].

Through subsequent centuries, Europe was generally ruled by monarchs, though various forms of parliament arose at different times.

Women elders voted on hereditary male chiefs and could depose them.\n\nThe emergence of modern democracy generally began with male citizens obtaining the right to vote in advance of female citizens, except in the Kingdom of Hawai'i, where universal suffrage was introduced in 1840 without mention of sex; however, a constitutional amendment in 1852 rescinded female voting and put property qualifications on male voting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kauanui |first=J.

The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] saw British women over 30 gain the vote. Dutch women won the vote in 1919, and American women on 26 August 1920 with the passage of the 19th Amendment (the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] secured voting rights for racial minorities).

Suffragist themes often included the notions that women were naturally kinder and more concerned about children and the elderly.  As Kraditor shows, it was often assumed that women voters would have a civilizing effect on politics, opposing domestic violence, liquor, and emphasizing cleanliness and community.  An opposing theme, Kraditor argues, held that women had the same moral standards. They should be equal in every way and that there was no such thing as a woman's \"natural role\".<ref>Aileen S.

The first general election at which women could vote was the [[1933 South African general election|1933&nbsp;election]]. At that election [[Leila Reitz]] (wife of [[Deneys Reitz]]) was elected as the first female&nbsp;MP, representing [[Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]]. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the [[Cape Province]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to white foreign nationals when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.\n\nThe right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]], was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult [[coloured]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1981. In 1984 the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was established, and the right to vote for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] and [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.\n\nIn 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] was granted to all adult citizens.\n\n====Southern Rhodesia====\nSouthern Rhodesian white women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie&nbsp;(1875\u20131950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920\u20131928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outside Westminster. The influx of women settlers from Britain proved a decisive factor in the 1922&nbsp;referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner Nationalists]] in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or \"responsible government\".<ref>See Lowry, 1997</ref> Black Rhodesian males qualified for the vote in 1923 (based only upon property, assets, income, and literacy).

Web. 4 Oct. 2016.</ref>\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[Bangladesh]] was (mostly) the province of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.<ref>Dilara Choudhury, and Al Masud Hasanuzzaman,  \"Political Decision-Making in Bangladesh and the Role of Women,\" ''Asian Profile,'' (Feb 1997) 25#1 pp. 53\u201369</ref>\n\n====India====\n{{main|Women's suffrage in India}}\nWomen in India were allowed to vote right from the first general elections after the independence of India in 1947 unlike during the British rule who resisted allowing women to vote.<ref name=\"BBCWomen\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43081429|title=Did the Empire resist women's suffrage in India?|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|date=2018-02-22|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1917. It sought votes for women and the right to hold legislative office on the same basis as men. These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref name = Basu>Aparna Basu, \"Women's Struggle for the Vote: 1917\u20131937,\" ''Indian Historical Review,'' (Jan 2008) 35#1 pp. 128\u201343</ref> British and [[Feminism in India|Indian feminists]] combined in 1918 to publish a magazine ''Stri Dharma'' that featured international news from a feminist perspective.<ref>Michelle Elizabeth Tusan, \"Writing Stri Dharma: international feminism, nationalist politics, and women's press advocacy in late colonial India,\" ''[[Women's History Review]],'' (Dec 2003) 12#4 pp. 623\u201349</ref> In 1919 in the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]], the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being [[monarchy|monarchies]]).<ref name = Basu/> In [[Bengal]] province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.<ref>Barbara Southard, \"Colonial Politics and Women's Rights: Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Bengal, British India in the 1920s,\" ''[[Modern Asian Studies]],'' (March 1993) 27#2 pp. 397\u2013439</ref>\n\nWhereas wealthy and educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This happened when the Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[sacred scripture]] of the Sikh faith.\n\nIn the [[Government of India Act 1935]] the [[British Raj]] set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women's leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.<ref>Basu (Jan 2008), 140\u201343</ref>\n\n====Indonesia====\n[[Indonesia]] granted women voting rights for municipal councils in 1905. Only men who could read and write could vote, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the [[Literacy|literacy rate]] for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group that pressed for women's suffrage in Indonesia was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association), founded in the [[Netherlands]] in 1894. VVV tried to attract Indonesian members, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the first national representative body, the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], was formed which still excluded women from voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, women gained the right to be elected to urban representative institutions, which led to some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, only European women and municipal councils could vote,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}<!-- how can a municipal council be a voter? --> excluding all other women and [[Local government|local councils]]. In September 1941, the Volksraad extended the vote to women of all races. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (subject to property and educational qualifications).<ref name=Blackburn>Blackburn, Susan, 'Winning the Vote for Women in Indonesia' ''Australian Feminist Studies'', Volume 14, Number 29, 1 April 1999, pp. 207\u201318</ref>\n\n====Iran====\n{{see also|1963 Iranian referendum}}\nA [[1963 Iranian referendum|referendum in January 1963]] overwhelmingly approved by voters gave women the right to vote, a right previously denied to them under the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|Iranian Constitution of 1906]] pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 3.<ref name=Timeline />\n\n====Israel====\nWomen have had full suffrage since the [[Israel's independence|establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948.\n\nThe first woman to be elected [[Prime Minister of Israel]] was [[Golda Meir]] in 1969.\n\n====Japan====\n[[File:Woman's Rights Meeting Tokyo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Women's Rights meeting in [[Tokyo]], to push for women's suffrage]]\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Japan}}\n\nAlthough women were allowed to vote in some prefectures in 1880, women's suffrage was enacted at a national level in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305105909/http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archivedate=2008-03-05 |title=The Fusae Ichikawa Memorial Association |publisher=Ichikawa-fusae.or.jp |accessdate=2011-01-08}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 January 2014.</ref>\n\n'''Korea'''\n\nSouth Korean women were granted the vote in 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/empowerment-women-south-korea|title=The Empowerment of Women in South Korea|date=2014-03-11|work=JIA SIPA|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Kuwait====\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Kuwait}}\nWhen voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the [[right to vote]].<ref name=\"stat\">{{Cite book|year=2001|title=African Women and Children: Crisis and Response|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom/page/8 8]|author=Apollo Rwomire|isbn=978-0-275-96218-0}}</ref> The right was later removed.

In 1906 the movement wrote an open letter to the Queen pleading for women's suffrage.

It promoted a vision of \"transcendent citizenship\" for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a white settler nation. While the women's suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of white women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked white women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \"racial degeneration.\"<ref>Anne-Marie.

Women involved in larger movements for social justice began to agitate equal rights and opportunities on par with men; following the example of their European peers, Elvira Dellepiane Rawson, [[Cecilia Grierson]] and [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]] began to form a number of groups in defense of the civil rights of women between 1900 and 1910.  The first major victories for extending the civil rights of women occurred in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|Province of San Juan]].  Women had been allowed to vote in that province since 1862, but only in municipal elections.  A similar right was extended in the [[Santa Fe Province|province of Santa Fe]] where a constitution that ensured women's suffrage was enacted at the municipal level, although female participation in votes initially remained low. In 1927, San Juan sanctioned its Constitution and broadly recognized the equal rights of men and women. However, the [[1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|1930 coup]] overthrew these advances.\n\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Balvanera - Manifestaci\u00f3n por el voto femenino en 1948.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Women's demonstration in Buenos Aires in front of the National Congress by law for universal suffrage, 1947]]\n\nA great pioneer of women's suffrage was [[Julieta Lanteri]], the daughter of Italian immigrants, who in 1910 requested a national court to grant her the right to citizenship (at the time not generally given to single female immigrants) as well as suffrage. The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: \"As a judge, I have a duty to declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived of what they do not prohibit.\"\n\nIn July 1911, [[Julieta Lanteri|Dr. Lanteri]] were enumerated, and on November 26 of that year exercised her right to vote, the first Ibero-American woman to vote.

In 1935, women's rights supporters founded the Feminine Cultural Group (known as 'ACF' from its initials in Spanish), with the goal of tackling women's problems. The group supported women's political and social rights, and believed it was necessary to involve and inform women about these issues in order to ensure their personal development. It went on to give seminars, as well as founding night schools and the House of Laboring Women.\n\nGroups looking to reform the 1936 Civil Code of Conduct in conjunction with the Venezuelan representation to the Union of American Women called the First Feminine Venezuelan Congress in 1940. In this congress, delegates discussed the situation of women in Venezuela and their demands. Key goals were women's suffrage and a reform to the Civil Code of Conduct. Around twelve thousand signatures were collected and handed to the Venezuelan Congress, which reformed the Civil Code of Conduct in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, groups supporting women's suffrage, the most important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained the right to vote at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the Correo C\u00edvico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the [[1945 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat|1945 Venezuelan Coup d'\u00c9tat]] and the [[1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election|call for a new Constitution]], to which women were elected, women's suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.\n\n==In non-religious organizations==\nThe right of women to vote has sometimes been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, it was not until 1964 that women in the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] in the United States were first allowed to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nad.org/nad-history#1970s |title=NAD History; National Association of the Deaf |publisher=Nad.org |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n===Catholicism===\nThe [[Pope]] is elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp |title=How is the Pope elected? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=2005-04-06 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Women are not appointed as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |title=Women and the Priesthood |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=2011-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904055106/http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |archivedate=2011-09-04 |df= }}</ref> The female Catholic offices of [[Abbess]] or Mother Superior are elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Women in Islam}}\nIn some countries, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Goodstein|first1=Laurie}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{see also|Women in Judaism}}\nIn Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and most Orthodox Jewish movements women have the right to vote.

Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (1952), and Switzerland (1971).\n\n[[Leslie P. Hume|Leslie Hume]] argues that the First World War changed the popular mood:\n\n: The women's contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Hume|title=The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies 1897\u20131914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1TlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT281|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=281|isbn=978-1-317-21326-0 }}</ref>\n\nExtended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before [[universal suffrage]] for men; for instance, literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it. The [[United Nations]] encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (1979) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this Convention.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:AnnaIIStolQued.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Anna II, Abbess of Quedlinburg]].

The first general election at which women could vote was the [[1933 South African general election|1933&nbsp;election]]. At that election [[Leila Reitz]] (wife of [[Deneys Reitz]]) was elected as the first female&nbsp;MP, representing [[Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]]. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the [[Cape Province]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to white foreign nationals when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.\n\nThe right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]], was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult [[coloured]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1981. In 1984 the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was established, and the right to vote for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] and [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.\n\nIn 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] was granted to all adult citizens.\n\n====Southern Rhodesia====\nSouthern Rhodesian white women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie&nbsp;(1875\u20131950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920\u20131928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outside Westminster. The influx of women settlers from Britain proved a decisive factor in the 1922&nbsp;referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner Nationalists]] in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or \"responsible government\".<ref>See Lowry, 1997</ref> Black Rhodesian males qualified for the vote in 1923 (based only upon property, assets, income, and literacy).

Web. 4 Oct. 2016.</ref>\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[Bangladesh]] was (mostly) the province of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.<ref>Dilara Choudhury, and Al Masud Hasanuzzaman,  \"Political Decision-Making in Bangladesh and the Role of Women,\" ''Asian Profile,'' (Feb 1997) 25#1 pp. 53\u201369</ref>\n\n====India====\n{{main|Women's suffrage in India}}\nWomen in India were allowed to vote right from the first general elections after the independence of India in 1947 unlike during the British rule who resisted allowing women to vote.<ref name=\"BBCWomen\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43081429|title=Did the Empire resist women's suffrage in India?|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|date=2018-02-22|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1917. It sought votes for women and the right to hold legislative office on the same basis as men. These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref name = Basu>Aparna Basu, \"Women's Struggle for the Vote: 1917\u20131937,\" ''Indian Historical Review,'' (Jan 2008) 35#1 pp. 128\u201343</ref> British and [[Feminism in India|Indian feminists]] combined in 1918 to publish a magazine ''Stri Dharma'' that featured international news from a feminist perspective.<ref>Michelle Elizabeth Tusan, \"Writing Stri Dharma: international feminism, nationalist politics, and women's press advocacy in late colonial India,\" ''[[Women's History Review]],'' (Dec 2003) 12#4 pp. 623\u201349</ref> In 1919 in the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]], the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being [[monarchy|monarchies]]).<ref name = Basu/> In [[Bengal]] province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.<ref>Barbara Southard, \"Colonial Politics and Women's Rights: Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Bengal, British India in the 1920s,\" ''[[Modern Asian Studies]],'' (March 1993) 27#2 pp. 397\u2013439</ref>\n\nWhereas wealthy and educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This happened when the Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[sacred scripture]] of the Sikh faith.\n\nIn the [[Government of India Act 1935]] the [[British Raj]] set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women's leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.<ref>Basu (Jan 2008), 140\u201343</ref>\n\n====Indonesia====\n[[Indonesia]] granted women voting rights for municipal councils in 1905. Only men who could read and write could vote, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the [[Literacy|literacy rate]] for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group that pressed for women's suffrage in Indonesia was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association), founded in the [[Netherlands]] in 1894. VVV tried to attract Indonesian members, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the first national representative body, the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], was formed which still excluded women from voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, women gained the right to be elected to urban representative institutions, which led to some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, only European women and municipal councils could vote,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}<!-- how can a municipal council be a voter? --> excluding all other women and [[Local government|local councils]]. In September 1941, the Volksraad extended the vote to women of all races. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (subject to property and educational qualifications).<ref name=Blackburn>Blackburn, Susan, 'Winning the Vote for Women in Indonesia' ''Australian Feminist Studies'', Volume 14, Number 29, 1 April 1999, pp. 207\u201318</ref>\n\n====Iran====\n{{see also|1963 Iranian referendum}}\nA [[1963 Iranian referendum|referendum in January 1963]] overwhelmingly approved by voters gave women the right to vote, a right previously denied to them under the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|Iranian Constitution of 1906]] pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 3.<ref name=Timeline />\n\n====Israel====\nWomen have had full suffrage since the [[Israel's independence|establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948.\n\nThe first woman to be elected [[Prime Minister of Israel]] was [[Golda Meir]] in 1969.\n\n====Japan====\n[[File:Woman's Rights Meeting Tokyo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Women's Rights meeting in [[Tokyo]], to push for women's suffrage]]\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Japan}}\n\nAlthough women were allowed to vote in some prefectures in 1880, women's suffrage was enacted at a national level in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305105909/http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archivedate=2008-03-05 |title=The Fusae Ichikawa Memorial Association |publisher=Ichikawa-fusae.or.jp |accessdate=2011-01-08}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 January 2014.</ref>\n\n'''Korea'''\n\nSouth Korean women were granted the vote in 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/empowerment-women-south-korea|title=The Empowerment of Women in South Korea|date=2014-03-11|work=JIA SIPA|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Kuwait====\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Kuwait}}\nWhen voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the [[right to vote]].<ref name=\"stat\">{{Cite book|year=2001|title=African Women and Children: Crisis and Response|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom/page/8 8]|author=Apollo Rwomire|isbn=978-0-275-96218-0}}</ref> The right was later removed.

The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a white settler nation. While the women's suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of white women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked white women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \"racial degeneration.\"<ref>Anne-Marie.

Women involved in larger movements for social justice began to agitate equal rights and opportunities on par with men; following the example of their European peers, Elvira Dellepiane Rawson, [[Cecilia Grierson]] and [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]] began to form a number of groups in defense of the civil rights of women between 1900 and 1910.  The first major victories for extending the civil rights of women occurred in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|Province of San Juan]].  Women had been allowed to vote in that province since 1862, but only in municipal elections.  A similar right was extended in the [[Santa Fe Province|province of Santa Fe]] where a constitution that ensured women's suffrage was enacted at the municipal level, although female participation in votes initially remained low. In 1927, San Juan sanctioned its Constitution and broadly recognized the equal rights of men and women. However, the [[1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|1930 coup]] overthrew these advances.\n\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Balvanera - Manifestaci\u00f3n por el voto femenino en 1948.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Women's demonstration in Buenos Aires in front of the National Congress by law for universal suffrage, 1947]]\n\nA great pioneer of women's suffrage was [[Julieta Lanteri]], the daughter of Italian immigrants, who in 1910 requested a national court to grant her the right to citizenship (at the time not generally given to single female immigrants) as well as suffrage. The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: \"As a judge, I have a duty to declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived of what they do not prohibit.\"\n\nIn July 1911, [[Julieta Lanteri|Dr. Lanteri]] were enumerated, and on November 26 of that year exercised her right to vote, the first Ibero-American woman to vote.

On July 17, 1919, he served as deputy national on behalf of the people of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]].\n\nOn February 27, 1946, three days after the [[1946 Argentine general election|elections]] that consecrated president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his wife First Lady [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] 26 years of age gave his first political speech in an organized women to thank them for their support of Per\u00f3n's candidacy. On that occasion, Eva demanded equal rights for men and women and particularly, women's suffrage:\n\n{{quote|The woman Argentina has exceeded the period of civil tutorials.

The opposition of conservative bias was evident, not only the opposition parties but even within parties who supported [[Peronism]]. Eva Per\u00f3n constantly pressured the parliament for approval, even causing protests from the latter for this intrusion.\n\nAlthough it was a brief text in three articles, that practically could not give rise to discussions, the Senate recently gave preliminary approval to the project August 21, 1946, and had to wait over a year for the House of Representative to publish the September 9, 1947 Law 13,010, establishing equal political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in [[Argentina]]. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously.\n\n[[File:Eva Per\u00f3n votando.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Eva Per\u00f3n]] voting at the hospital in 1951.

Here it is, my sisters, summarized into few articles of compact letters lies a long history of battles, stumbles, and hope.\nBecause of this, in it there lie exasperating indignation, shadows of menacing sunsets, but also cheerful awakenings of triumphal auroras. And the latter which translates the victory of women over the incomprehensions, the denials, and the interests created by the castes now repudiated by our national awakening.\nAnd a leader who destiny forged to victoriously face the problems of our era, General [Per\u00f3n].

In 1935, women's rights supporters founded the Feminine Cultural Group (known as 'ACF' from its initials in Spanish), with the goal of tackling women's problems. The group supported women's political and social rights, and believed it was necessary to involve and inform women about these issues in order to ensure their personal development. It went on to give seminars, as well as founding night schools and the House of Laboring Women.\n\nGroups looking to reform the 1936 Civil Code of Conduct in conjunction with the Venezuelan representation to the Union of American Women called the First Feminine Venezuelan Congress in 1940. In this congress, delegates discussed the situation of women in Venezuela and their demands. Key goals were women's suffrage and a reform to the Civil Code of Conduct. Around twelve thousand signatures were collected and handed to the Venezuelan Congress, which reformed the Civil Code of Conduct in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, groups supporting women's suffrage, the most important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained the right to vote at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the Correo C\u00edvico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the [[1945 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat|1945 Venezuelan Coup d'\u00c9tat]] and the [[1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election|call for a new Constitution]], to which women were elected, women's suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.\n\n==In non-religious organizations==\nThe right of women to vote has sometimes been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, it was not until 1964 that women in the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] in the United States were first allowed to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nad.org/nad-history#1970s |title=NAD History; National Association of the Deaf |publisher=Nad.org |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n===Catholicism===\nThe [[Pope]] is elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp |title=How is the Pope elected? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=2005-04-06 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Women are not appointed as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |title=Women and the Priesthood |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=2011-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904055106/http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |archivedate=2011-09-04 |df= }}</ref> The female Catholic offices of [[Abbess]] or Mother Superior are elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Women in Islam}}\nIn some countries, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Goodstein|first1=Laurie}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{see also|Women in Judaism}}\nIn Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and most Orthodox Jewish movements women have the right to vote.

It is uncertain whether it was situated on the southern tip of the hill or on the northern elevation, near the Kammerhof.\n\nThe oldest part of the present-day palace was built in the 14th century by [[Stephen, Duke of Slavonia]], who was the younger brother of King [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Only the foundations remain of the [[keep|castle keep]], which was known as '''Stephen's Tower''' (Hungarian: ''Istv\u00e1n-torony''). The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] palace of King Louis I was arranged around a narrow courtyard next to the keep.\n\n[[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] significantly enlarged the palace and strengthened its fortifications. Sigismund, as a [[Holy Roman Emperor]], needed a magnificent royal residence to express his prominence among the rulers of Europe. He chose Buda Castle as his main residence, and during his long reign it became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late [[Middle Ages]]. Buda was an important artistic centre of the [[International Gothic]] style.\n\nConstruction began in the 1410s and was largely finished in the 1420s, although some minor works continued until the death of the king in 1437. The palace was first mentioned in 1437, under the name \"''fricz palotha''\".\n\nThe most important part of Sigismund's palace was the northern wing, known as the Fresh Palace (Hun: ''Friss-palota''). On the top floor was a large hall called the Roman Hall ({{convert|70|xx|20|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with a carved wooden ceiling. Great windows and balconies faced toward the city of [[Buda]]. The fa\u00e7ade of the palace was decorated with statues, a and coat-of-arms. In front stood the bronze [[equestrian statue]] of Sigismund, later repaired by King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]].\n\nThe southern part of the royal residency was surrounded with narrow ''[[zwingers]]''. Two parallel walls, the so-called \"cortina walls\", run down from the palace to the River [[Danube]] across the steep hillside. The most imposing structure, the Broken Tower (Hun: ''Csonka-torony''), on the western side of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', remained unfinished. The basement of the tower was used as a [[dungeon]]; the top floors were probably the treasury of the royal jewels.\n\nThe last phase of large-scale building activity took place under King Matthias Corvinus. During the first decades of his reign the king finished the work on the Gothic palace. The Royal Chapel, with the surviving [[Palace Chapel (Buda Castle)|Lower Church]], was likely built at that time.\n\nAfter the marriage of Matthias and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476, Italian [[humanists]], artists and craftsmen arrived at Buda. The Hungarian capital became the first centre of [[Renaissance]] north of the Alps. The king rebuilt the palace in an early Renaissance style. The ''cour d'honneur'' was modernised and an Italian ''[[loggia]]'' was added. Inside the palace were two rooms with golden ceilings: the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana]] and a passage with the frescoes of the twelve signs of the [[Zodiac]]. The fa\u00e7ade of the palace was decorated with statues of [[John Hunyadi]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hunyadi]] and King Matthias. In the middle of the court there was a fountain with a statue of [[Pallas Athene]].\n\nOnly fragments remain of this Renaissance palace: some red marble balustrades, lintels and decorative glazed tiles from stoves and floors.\n\n[[File:Var rondellecivertanlegi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|The reconstructed medieval fortifications and the Great Rondella]]\nIn the last years of his reign Matthias Corvinus started construction of a new Renaissance palace on the eastern side of the Sigismund Courtyard, next to the Fresh Palace. The '''Matthias Palace''' remained unfinished because of the king's early death. The palace had a monumental red marble stairway in front of the fa\u00e7ade. Matthias Corvinus was usually identified with [[Hercules]] by the humanists of his court; the bronze gates were decorated with panels depicting the deeds of Hercules, and a great bronze statue of the Greek hero welcomed the guests in the [[forecourt]] of the palace complex, where [[jousts]] were held.\n\nThe walled gardens of the palace were laid out on the western slopes of the Castle Hill. In the middle of the enclosure, a Renaissance villa was built by Matthias. Only one column survives of this so-called ''Aula Marmorea''.\n\nAfter the death of Matthias Corvinus, his successor, King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], carried on the works of the '''Matthias Palace''', especially after his marriage with [[Anna of Foix-Candale]] in 1502.\n\nUnder the reign of King [[John Z\u00e1polya]] (the last national ruler of Hungary) the palace was repaired. On the southern tip of the Castle Hill, the Great Rondella was built by Italian military engineers. The circular [[bastion]] is one of the main surviving structure of the old palace.\n\n===Ottoman Era===\n[[File:Buda Citerioris Hungariae Caput Regni avita sedes. vulgo Ofen 1617.jpg|thumb|Georg Houfnagel's view of Buda in 1617|alt=|left]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] collapsed. The [[Ottoman Turks]] occupied the evacuated town on 11 September 1526. Although Buda was sacked and burned, the Royal Palace was not damaged. Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] carried away all the bronze statues (the Hunyadis, Pallas Athene and Hercules) with him to [[Constantinople]]. The statues were destroyed there in a rebellion a few years later. The Sultan also took many volumes from the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana|Corvina library]].\n\nIn 1529 the Ottoman army besieged and occupied Buda again, and the palace was badly damaged. On 29 August 1541 Buda was occupied again by the Ottomans, without any resistance. Buda became part of [[Ottoman Empire]] and the seat of the [[Eyalet]] of Budin. The original German and Hungarian population left the city, immigrants from Ottoman Empire and the Balkan peninsula came to their place.<ref>Oliver A. I. Botar : From European Capital to Ottoman Outpost: The Decline of Buda in the Sixteenth Century, (1987, Spring) LINK: [http://epa.oszk.hu/00000/00010/00016/pdf/HSR_1987_1_003-025.pdf]</ref>\n\nAlthough Turkish travel writers wrote enthusiastically about the beauty of the palace of the Hungarian kings, the new Ottoman government let the palace decay. It was partially used as barracks a storage place and stables, and otherwise it stood empty.\n\nThe palace was called ''I\u00e7 Kala'' (\"Inner Castle\") and ''Hisar Pe\u00e7e'' (\"Citadel\") by the Turks. The name of the ''cour d'honneur'' was ''\"Seray meydani\"''. The favourite nickname of the complex was \"Palace of the Golden Apples\".[[File:Die Einnahme von Buda 1686.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] took [[Buda]] after a long [[Battle of Buda (1686)|siege]] in 1686]]\n\nThe economic decline of [[Buda]] the capital city during the Ottoman conquest characterised by the stagnation of population, the population of Buda was not larger in 1686, than the population of the city two centuries earlier in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andr\u00e1s Ger\u0151, J\u00e1nos Po\u00f3r|title=Budapest: a history from its beginnings to 1998, Volume 86 van Atlantic studies on society in change , Volume 462 van East European monographs|publisher=Social Science Monographs|page=3|year=1997|ISBN=9780880333597|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sONnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22population+of+Buda%22&dq=%22population+of+Buda%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjIufSz26vIAhXEWxoKHVEpAqg}}</ref> The Ottomans allowed the Hungarian royal place to fall into ruins.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew Wheatcroft|title=The Enemy at the Gate: Habsburgs, Ottomans, and the Battle for Europe|publisher=Basic Books|page=206|year=2010|ISBN=9780465020812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA206 }}</ref> The amortised palace was later transformed into a gunpowder storage and magazine by the Ottomans,<ref>{{cite book|author= Steve Fallon, Sally Schafer|title=Lonely Planet Budapest|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2015|ISBN=9781743605059|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jOJzBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT443 }}</ref> which caused its detonation during the siege in 1686.

Unsuccessful sieges in 1542, 1598, 1603 and 1684 caused serious damage. The Ottoman authorities repaired only the fortifications. According to 17th-century sources, many buildings of the former Royal Palace were roofless and their vaults collapsed. Nonetheless the medieval palace mostly survived until the great siege of 1686.\n\n===Destruction of the medieval castle===\n[[File:Ostrom1686.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|The great siege of Buda (1686); contemporary drawing]]\nThe medieval palace was destroyed in the [[Battle of Buda (1686)|great siege of 1686]] when Buda was captured by allied Christian forces.\n\nIn 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed Western European Christian campaign was started to take the city. This time the Holy League's army was much larger, consisting of 65,000\u2013100,000 men, including German, Hungarian, Croat, Dutch, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers and other Europeans as volunteers, [[artillerymen]] and officers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] defenders consisted of 7,000 men.<ref>{{cite book|last=Young|first=William|title=International Politics and Warfare in the Age of Louis XIV and Peter the Great: A Guide to the Historical Literature|year=2004|publisher=iUniverse|page=433|ISBN=9780595329922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wErzZ_lUWAQC&pg=PA432}}</ref>\n\nIn a heavy artillery bombardment, many buildings burned and collapsed. The Stephen's Tower, used as a [[gunpowder]] store by the Ottomans, exploded when hit by a single cannon, said to have been fired by a [[friar]] called G\u00e1bor, also referred as T\u00fczes G\u00e1bor (\"Gabriel Fiery\"). According to contemporary sources, the explosion killed as many as 1,500 Turkish soldiers and caused a wave on the Danube that washed away artillery batteries and guards standing on the opposite shore.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nHabsburg military engineers made several plans and drawings of the buildings in subsequent decades. Although the walls mainly survived, the burned-out shell rapidly decayed from a lack of maintenance. Between 1702 and 1715, Stephen's Tower disappeared completely, and the palace was beyond repair. In 1715, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles III]] ordered the demolition of the ruins. Johann H\u00f6lbling surveyed the still-existing structures. The king ordered the surviving marble statues, antiquities, inscriptions and coins should be spared (there is no evidence about the realization of the royal decree). The main part of the palace and the Broken Tower were totally demolished, the hollows and moats were filled and a new flat [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] was established. The southern fortifications, zwingers and rooms were buried under tons of rubbish and earth.\n\n===Early Baroque palace===\n[[File:Samuel Mikoviny 001.jpg|thumb|The royal castle built under King Charles III (1733)]]\nIn 1715 a small [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] palace was built according to the plans of Johann H\u00f6lbling. It was a simple rectangular building, with an inner court and a shorter side wing, which was later demolished. The H\u00f6lbling palace is identical with the core of the present-day palace, where the Baroque Court of the Budapest Historical Museum is now located.\n\nThe interior of the palace was left unfinished when work stopped in 1719. The [[Hofkriegsrat]] commissioned Fortunato di Prati to make several plans for the palace, but lack of money hindered their implementation.\n\nIn 1723 the palace was accidentally burned down and the windows were walled up in order to stop further deterioration. Several drawings from the 1730s and 1740s show the unfinished decaying shell of the simple two-storey blockhouse. Some engravings show an idealised finished version which never existed. Sometime around 1730 the roof was repaired.\n\n===Era of Maria Theresa===\n[[File:Johann Ernst Mansfeld 001.jpg|thumb|The royal castle during the reign of Maria Theresa (1777)|alt=|left]]\nIn 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich, President of the Hungarian Chamber, appealed to the public to finish the derelict palace by means of public subscription. Palatine [[J\u00e1nos P\u00e1lffy]] called upon the [[Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]] and cities to award grants for the project. The moment was favourable because relations between the Hungarian nobility and the Habsburgs were exceptionally good. The Hungarians supported Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] in the dire need of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The queen was grateful for this, and the new Royal Palace became the symbol of peace and friendship between the dynasty and the nation.\n\nThe plans of the splendid, U-shaped Baroque palace with a ''cour d'honneur'' were drawn by Jean Nicolas Jadot, chief architect of the Viennese court. After 1753 the plans were modified by his successor, Nicolaus Pacassi. Ign\u00e1c Oraschek, master builder, who guided the works, and modified the plans according to his own ideas. The foundation stone of the palace was laid on 13 May 1749, which was the Queen's birthday. The work continued at a good pace until 1758, when financial difficulties caused a seven-year break. By that time only the interiors were left unfinished.[[File:Budapest, Castle Hill, Hungary - panoramio (6).jpg|thumb|The fa\u00e7ade of the ''cour d'honneur'' constructed under Hillebrandt in the 1760s]]According to surviving historical documents, the layout of the palace followed Jadot's signed plans of 1749. The fa\u00e7ades, some interior elements and the St. Sigismund Chapel are the works of [[Nicol\u00f2 Pacassi]], while the special double [[false dome]]s were probably planned by Oraschek, formerly the master builder of Count Grassalkovich. Double false domes were typical features of the so-called Grassalkovich-type Baroque castles like [[G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151]]. However, this feature was later removed from the palace.\n\nIn 1764 the Queen visited the palace and allotted 20,000 [[thalers]] a year for the work, which recommenced in 1765 according to the plans of Franz Anton Hillebrandt. Hillebrand altered the ''cour d'honneur'' fa\u00e7ade of the central wing in [[Rococo]] style. In 1769 the St. Sigismund Chapel was consecrated and the palace was finished the same year. According to the aggregate statement of Grassalkovich, the costs were 402,679 [[forints]].\n\n===Nuns and scholars===\nThe future of the complex was uncertain; the Queen had no intention to use it as a royal residence, because she did not spend much time in Buda. In 1769 she gave one wing to the [[Sisters of Loreto]], who came from [[Sankt P\u00f6lten]]. The building was handed over on 13 May 1770, but the elegant Baroque rooms were considered unsuitable for a [[nunnery]]. Alexander [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevich]], rector of the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]],<ref>Ungarische Revue, Volume 11, S.53, Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia, Franklin-Verein, 1891.</ref> had provided financing to Maria Theresa, which supposedly should have been repaid, according to her letters to her children and friends.<ref>Briefe an ihre Kinder und Freunde; Verfasser/in: Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria; Alfred Ritter von Arneth, Verlag: Braum\u00fcller, Wien 1881.</ref> In 1777 the Queen decided that the University of [[Trnava|Nagyszombat]] should move to Buda.\n\nThe nuns moved out and the palace was hastily adapted to use as a university. The work was guided by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Farkas Kempelen]] and led to classrooms, teacher's cabinets, museums, a library and a university press being built. In the front, the false dome was removed and a four-storey observatory tower, planned by [[Alfred Hillebrandt]] or Karl Georg Zillack, was erected.\n\nIn 1778 Hillebrandt built a new chapel for [[Saint Stephen of Hungary|the first king of Hungary, Saint Stephen's]], the mummified right hand, which was recovered by Queen Maria Theresa from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] in 1771.<ref>Europe's centre around AD 1000, Volume 1, page 7, Council of Europe, Art Exhibition, Alfried Wieczorek, Hans-Martin Hinz, Theiss, 2000. {{ISBN|978-3-8062-1549-6}}</ref><ref>[[Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107]], page 54, \u017deljko Brneti\u0107, \u0160kolska knjiga, 1990. {{ISBN|978-86-03-99817-7}}</ref> The Chapel of the Holy Right was situated near the St Sigismund Chapel, in the middle of an inner court. The outer form was [[octagon]]al and the inside was oval, crowned by a dome. The altar-piece was painted by Joseph Hauzinger.\n\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony of the university was held on 25 June 1780, the 40th anniversary of the coronation of the Queen. The throne room became a splendid [[wikt:aula#Latin|aula]] decorated with frescoes depicting the four faculties. In 1953, two [[grisaille]] frescoes were discovered on the shorter sides of the room.\n\n===Residence of the Palatines===\n[[File:J\u00f3zsef n\u00e1dor Barab\u00e1s Mikl\u00f3s.jpg|thumb|Archduke Joseph Anton, [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|Palatine of Hungary]], resided in the castle.]]\nFunctional problems of the university remained unresolved, which led to the faculties being moved to [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in 1783. In 1791 the palace became the residence of the new Habsburg [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]] of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria]]. After the early death of the palatine in 1795, his younger brother [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Joseph]] succeeded him, followed by [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Stephen]]. The palatinal court in Buda Castle was the centre of fashionable life and high society in the Hungarian capital.\n\nIn 1810 the palatinal palace was damaged by fire, but in the next decades, plans were made to raise the building with an upper storey, but they were not implemented, although the observatory tower, which hindered the work, was removed. In 1838 the crypt of the St. Sigismund Chapel was rebuilt according to the plans of Franz H\u00fcppmann: the [[Palatinal Crypt]] was the burial place of Palatine Joseph and his family. The crypt is the only part of the palace that survived the Second World War.\n\nPalatine Joseph established gardens on the southern and eastern hillsides of the Castle Hill according to the plans of Antal Tost. The gardens of Buda Castle were among the most famous English-style [[landscape garden]]s in Hungary.\n\nPalatine Stephen left the palace on 23 September 1848 when a break between the liberal Hungarian government and the dynasty became inevitable.\n\nOn 5 January Buda was occupied by the Austrian army led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]]. The chief commander lodged in the royal palace.\n\nOn 4 May 1849, the Hungarian army, led by [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], [[Battle of Buda (1849)|laid siege on Buda Castle]], which was being defended by General [[Heinrich Hentzi]]. On 20 May the Hungarians captured Buda with an assault. The palace was the last stronghold of the Austrian troops, and became a site of heavy artillery fighting. The ensuing fire consumed the central and southern wings; they were completely burned out and their interiors were destroyed.\n\n===Era of Franz Joseph===\n[[File:Budai var01.jpg|thumb|Buda Castle before its remodeling in the 1880s]]\nThe palace was rebuilt between 1850 and 1856 by Josef Weiss and Carl Neuwirth. The 13-axis central wing was raised with a third storey and a squat attic-tower. The central [[risalit]] was decorated with a balcony of six colossal columns. With these changes, the former Viennese Baroque palace of Maria Theresa became considered a more austere [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical Baroque]] building.\n\nThe ballroom was redecorated with marbles and stuccoes. After 1853 stately rooms were designed in a French Rococo style, with white-gold [[stucco]]es and furniture from the [[Hofburg]]. The palace was already too small for the needs of the royal court, so the kitchens and service rooms were housed in the neighbouring [[Zeughaus, Buda|Zeughaus]]. The palace was connected with the Zeughaus by a glassed passageway.\n\nOn the western side of the ''cour d'honneur'' two smaller buildings were erected, using plans by Weiss and Neuwirth in 1854. The two-storey ''St\u00f6ckl'' housed the apartments of the archdukes and imperial officials, whereas the Wachlokal was built for the royal guards.[[File:Gyoergy Kloesz 001.jpg|thumb|View of the castle before its remodeling, as seen from the Danube|alt=|left]]Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] visited Buda Castle in 1856 and 1857. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], Franz Joseph was crowned king of Hungary. The palace played an important part in the lavish ceremony and was a symbol of peace between the dynasty and the nation.\n\nIn the last decades of the 19th century Budapest experienced rapid economic development. Ambitious [[urban planning]] projects were carried out to express the growing wealth and higher status of the Hungarian capital, with special attention being paid to the rebuilding of Buda Castle. The autonomous Hungarian government intended to create a royal palace to match any famous European royal residence (especially their old rival, [[Vienna]]'s Hofburg). The rebuilding spanned forty years, between 1875 and 1912, and caused sweeping changes in topography of the entire area.\n\nFirst the V\u00e1rkert-baz\u00e1r (Royal Garden Pavilion) was built on the embankment of the Danube, at the foot of the Castle Hill, between 1875 and 1882. This [[Neo-Renaissance]] gateway was designed by a Hungarian architect named [[Mikl\u00f3s Ybl]]. The structure was an open arcade, with pavilions, stairways and ramps, and two blocks of flats. Ybl also built a new waterworks pumping station, named V\u00e1rkert-kioszk (Royal Garden Kiosk), and two stair towers against the medieval cortina walls. The southern stair tower followed French Renaissance style, resembling a small turreted castle, while the northern stair tower was similar to a Gothic brick donjon (a fortified main tower from a castle, also called a keep). Only V\u00e1rkert-baz\u00e1r and V\u00e1rkert-kioszk survive currently.\n\n[[File:Budai var03.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Danube terrace with Eugene of Savoy's monument]]\nIn 1882 Prime Minister [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] charged Ybl with drawing a master plan for rebuilding the palace. In his 1885 plan, Ybl preserved the old Baroque palace, but mirrored it on the western side of the ''cour d'honneur'', which doubled the size of the residence. He also planned a new [[carriageway]] on the western hillside, demolishing the medieval walls and towers of the \u00dajvil\u00e1g-kert terrace. The narrowness of the natural plateau of the Castle Hill meant there was not enough space for the new Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, which Ybl solved by erecting a substructure down to the foot of the hill. The monumental western fa\u00e7ade sits on this windowless, three-storey high substructure. The whole block covered almost the entire hill, but the main fa\u00e7ade on the ''cour d'honneur'' had the same modest height as the Baroque palace. The fa\u00e7ade was clad with stone slabs, while the old parts are stuccoed; hence, the difference between the original Baroque and the Neo-Renaissance wings is obvious. The formerly open ''cour d'honneur'' became a closed court with an arched gateway, guarded by the four lions of the sculptor, [[J\u00e1nos Fadrusz]]. The court is called Lions Court (or ''Oroszl\u00e1nos udvar'').\n\n[[File:Buda Royal Castle western courtyard 1880.jpg|thumb|Royal procession in the western courtyard (1880s)]]\nThe work began on 1 May 1890, but Ybl died on 22 January 1891. His successor, [[Alajos Hauszmann]], slightly modified the plans of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing. In 1896 the building reached the level of the court, and King Franz Joseph ceremoniously laid down the foundation stone of the palace, which was soon completed.\n\nIn 1893, the 25th anniversary of King Franz Joseph's coronation was celebrated in the Royal Palace. However, the old banqueting hall proved to be too small, so Hauszmann enlarged the room by knocking down and reconstructing the wall towards the ''cour d'honneur'' (which additionally had the Hillebrandt fa\u00e7ade).\n\nIn spite of this expansion and Ybl's new wing, the palace was still deemed insufficient for great royal celebrations, so another round of construction began. The north wing, standing on the site of the old Zeughaus, was completely designed by Hauszmann. The architect doubled the Baroque palace on the Danube side, generally imitating its traditional architectural style. At the meeting point of the old and the new wings, a colonnaded portico was erected, with a lavishly-decorated [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] (with allegorical statues by K\u00e1roly Sennyey) and a flight of stairs called the ''Habsburg Stairs''. The whole palace was crowned with a dome with a copy of the [[Crown of St. Stephen]] at its apex. The dome, like other details of the north wing, shows German ''[[Jugendstil]]'' influences, as does the rear fa\u00e7ade towards the western forecourt. This forecourt also contains the [[Matthias Fountain]] (Hungarian: ''M\u00e1ty\u00e1s k\u00fatja'') by sculptor [[Alajos Str\u00f3bl]]. Above the main gate, towards Szent Gy\u00f6rgy t\u00e9r, stood a statue of the Goddess Hungaria. This side was the main fa\u00e7ade of the complex, but it was much shorter and less characteristic than the long Danube fa\u00e7ade. The old Chapel of the Holy Right was demolished to make room for a carriageway.\n\n[[File:Budai var02.jpg|thumb|The western forecourt with the facade of the Grand Ballroom|alt=|left]]\nHauszmann designed a new riding school in the former \u00dajvil\u00e1g terrace, which was now named the ''Csik\u00f3s'' court, after the Csik\u00f3s statue of Gy\u00f6rgy Vastagh (now in the western forecourt). In front of the long Danube fa\u00e7ade, an equestrian statue was erected in honour of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], the victorious leader of the Habsburg army in the [[Battle of Zenta]]. The eastern forecourt was closed off with a lavish wrought-iron rail, which ended in a pillar crowned by a statue of the legendary [[Turul]], the sacred bird of the [[Magyars]], spreading its wings above Budapest. Two flights of stairs led up to the Szent Gy\u00f6rgy t\u00e9r, which was on much higher ground.\n\nIn the western forecourt, Hauszmann designed a new neo-Baroque guardhouse and rebuilt the old Royal Stables. The Royal Gardens on the southern hillside were famous for their precious plants, glass houses and picturesque terraces. In the middle of the gardens stood the Swiss House of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Queen Elisabeth]], furnished with Hungarian folk art objects. The house was built above the ruins of the medieval gatehouse, partially making use of them.\n\nThe interior of the palace was decorated and furnished exclusively with works of the leading Hungarian artists of the age. The Royal Palace was officially inaugurated in 1912. Contemporary critics praised it as the most outstanding Hungarian building of the turn of the 20th century.\n\n===Interbellum years and World War II===\n[[File:Royal Castle Budapest 1926.JPG|thumb|View of the dome and the terrace with Prince Eugene's monument (1926)]]\nThe Hauszmann palace existed for around three decades: on 30 December 1916, the building played a part in the coronation ceremony of the last Hungarian king, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV of Hungary]]. After the 1918 revolution and the removal of the Habsburg dynasty, the Royal Palace became the seat of the new regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Horthy lived in the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing with his family between the years of 1920 and 1944. In this era the palace was the centre of Hungarian political and social life. Famous guests entertained by Horthy in the palace included King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] in 1937 and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) in 1938.[[File:Budav\u00e1ri Palota 10x15.jpg|thumb|The Royal Palace in the 1930s|alt=|left]]On 16 October 1944 a Nazi German commando unit, led by [[Otto Skorzeny]], occupied the Royal Palace and forced the regent to abdicate. Buda Castle was the last major stronghold of Budapest held by [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis forces]] during the [[Battle of Budapest|siege of Budapest]] between 29 December 1944 and 13 February 1945. The German and Hungarian forces defending the castle attempted to break the Soviet blockade on 11 February 1945, but failed. Allegedly the Soviet Red Army knew about their plans and had aimed heavy weapons at the possible escape routes hours earlier. This is considered one of the biggest disasters of Hungarian military history.\n\nHeavy fights and artillery fire rendered the palace into ruins. The furniture vanished, roofs and vaults collapsed and the southern and western wings were burned out. The destruction was comparable to that of the great siege of 1686.\n\n===Reconstruction===\nImmediately after the war, archeological research was begun in order to unearth the remains of the [[Medieval Royal Palace (Buda Castle)|medieval castle]]. The research, led by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ger\u0151 (1946\u20131966) and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Zolnay (1967\u20131979), was likely the biggest castle excavation in Europe. The former Royal Gardens stairways, pavilions and glass houses, which dated from the turn of the 20th century, had to be sacrificed. Important parts of the former Sigismund and Matthias Palace had survived under the thick earth fill.\n\n[[File:Lanc hid - Budapest 3 Febr 1946 Foto Takkk Hungary.jpg|thumb|The burned-out ruins of the Royal Palace and the Chain Bridge (1946)]]\nThe first reconstruction plan of the medieval remains was written by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ger\u0151 in 1950 and finalised in 1952. The reconstruction work was finished in 1966. Contrary to the generally accepted principles of historic reconstruction, the medieval fortification system was rebuilt in its entirety. Important elements like the 16th century Great Rondella and the medieval Gatehouse, the Mace Tower, the walls and the zwingers were reconstructed according to the results of the archaeological research and contemporary pictorial evidence. The low-lying southern wing of the Gothic palace was also reconstructed, together with the vaulted Gothic Hall and the Lower Church of the former Royal Chapel. Medieval-style gardens were planted in the zwingers. The foundation of the Stephen's Tower was unearthed, but as archaeological evidence was lacking, the tower was not reconstructed. The remains of the Broken Tower were covered again.\n\nThe large-scale reconstruction of the medieval fortifications substantially changed the cityscape of Budapest. At the time it was considered a highly successful project, reconciling historical authenticity with urban-planning demands.\n\nIn the 1970s, archeological research continued on the northern and western side of the palace, led by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Zolnay. It produced many important achievements, including the Late Gothic Buda Castle Statues. The Karakash Pasha Tower, in the ''\u00dajvil\u00e1g Garden'', was a Turkish-era tower demolished at the end of the 19th century. Photographic evidence enabled its reconstruction, but the new tower was only a copy of the original, and the details are not considered authentic.\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Buda Castle 2365941876 12a03f263c.jpg|thumb|The modernist dome designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961. Vast amounts of art work and sculpture on the exterior and almost all of the interior that survived the war were intentionally destroyed during the postwar reconstruction.]]\nThe government made a decision about reconstruction only in 1948. According to contemporary photos, all the important interiors were in a damaged state, but their reconstruction was technically possible. The new communist government of Hungary considered the Royal Palace a symbol of the former regime. Therefore, Hungarian leaders chose to thoroughly modernise the interior and exterior of the palace. Architectural trends played a part in the decision, as modernist architects had condemned the Hauszmann style as \"too ornate\".\n\nThe first modernist reconstruction plan was made by architect Istv\u00e1n Jan\u00e1ky in 1950. His controversial concept was later modified. In 1952 the Hungarian government asked for help from Poland, because they had successfully rebuilt [[Warsaw]] and, indeed, other cities. A delegation of Polish experts, led by the architectural historian [[Jan Zachwatowicz]], proposed the rebuilding of the Hauszmann palace.[[File:Buda--Castles01.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the castle today|alt=|left]]During the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the remaining interior, including the rooms and halls that were undamaged, were destroyed. Important exterior details, such as the main entrance, the Habsburg Steps, the dome, the Royal Stables, the guardhouse and the riding school were demolished, and the remaining fa\u00e7ades were simplified. In Lions Court the ornate gates of ''King's Stairs'' and ''Diplomat's Stairs'' were demolished. The doorway of the castle church disappeared, as did the chapel. The detailed Neo-Baroque roofs were simplified and plain new windows were installed. The allegorical sculpture group of the tympanum was destroyed.\n\nAt the same time however, medieval elements that were uncovered were reconstructed in what was thought their appearance was. No precise drawings existed of the medieval elements, therefore an approximate reconstruction of their appearance was done.\n\nThe modernist dome was designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961 after Italian Baroque models. The palace was rebuilt by 1966, but the interior spaces were ready only in the 1980s. Buda Castle became a cultural centre, home to three museums and the [[National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library]].\n\n===21st century===\nIn March 2006 the National Office of Cultural Heritage finalised the long-term development plan of Buda Castle. Asserting that the modernisation in 1952\u201366 caused irreversible damage, they proposed the partial reconstruction of the fa\u00e7ades, including the dome and the Habsburg Steps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nol.hu/archivum/archiv-390037?ref=sso|title=N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g \u2013 Pap\u00edron sz\u00e9p a V\u00e1r j\u00f6v\u0151je|work=nol.hu|accessdate=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113092114/http://nol.hu/archivum/archiv-390037?ref=sso|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> No decision has been reached about the realization of the development plan.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] chose the medieval King's Cellar in Buda Castle as the place to announce the list of the \"most important public works projects\", which was financed by [[European Union]] funds between 2007 and 2013.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfu.hu/a_kormany_dontott_az_uj_magyarorszag_fejlesztesi_terv_akcioterveirol |title=Nemzeti Fejleszt\u00e9si \u00dcgyn\u00f6ks\u00e9g |publisher=Nfu.hu |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206091241/http://www.nfu.hu/a_kormany_dontott_az_uj_magyarorszag_fejlesztesi_terv_akcioterveirol |archivedate=6 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 an international consortium began to build an underground garage for 700 cars under the former Csik\u00f3s Court.

Only the ground and first floors were reconstructed; the castle was originally much higher. The unfinished fa\u00e7ade stops at the level of the Baroque terrace above, with two windows opening towards the southern court and another two opening towards the eastern court. The four almost-identical windows are square, four-panel stone constructions of very fine Gothic craftsmanship, with their outer frames decorated with small columns. One window, which had been walled up, was discovered ''in situ'' during archeological research, and the others were reconstructed from fragments by the sculptor Ern\u0151 Szak\u00e1l by means of [[anastylosis]]. The ground floor openings are simpler. An arched stone doorway gives access to the southern court from the cellar under the Gothic Hall.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade was originally plastered. The whitewashed surface was decorated with a painted pattern in a rusty hue, resembling [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. Fragments of painted geometrical decoration, a common feature on the medieval buildings of Buda, were discovered on the eastern fa\u00e7ade, but it was not restored.\n\nA Gothic balcony tower projects from the wall at the end of the eastern fa\u00e7ade. Its reconstruction was a much debated issue, because the balcony tower goes above the level of the Baroque terrace, disturbing the harmonious panorama of the palace. On the other hand, it clearly indicates that there are higher, missing floors.\n\nThe balcony tower is a two-storey structure standing on a wide stone basement. The first floor is a solid stone wall without any openings and the niche behind it belongs to the Gothic Hall. The second floor has a balcony with three windows; it is now closed off by a glass wall. Originally it would have been part of an important ceremonial room. The balcony is in the shape of half an octagon. The three Gothic double lancet windows are considered the most important architectural elements of the tower and the profiles; frames and mullions were restored in a simplified form, using many of the original stones. The tower is covered with a flat metal roof.\n\nThe Gothic Hall is connected to Stephen's Castle (''Istv\u00e1n v\u00e1r'') on the western side. It was named after Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, the younger brother of King Louis I of Hungary. Built in the 1340s\u20131370s, it is the oldest part of the medieval royal palace. Only the foundation and three interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms survive.\n\nStephen's Tower (''Istv\u00e1n torony'') was the keep of Stephen's Castle. However, it was destroyed by an explosion in 1686. The ground floor walls were discovered a little time after 1946. It was a square building (11.7 \u00d7 11.1 m), built upon the rock surface of Castle Hill. The walls are 2.31 to 2.7 m thick with narrow [[arrowslit]]s on the southern, western and northern sides. The original doorway, on the eastern side, was walled up after the Gothic Hall was built in the 15th century.\n\nStephen's Tower was originally a free-standing structure, sited differently from later buildings. The triangle in front of it was walled up to create a continuous southern fa\u00e7ade for the palace. During post-war reconstruction, this part of the fa\u00e7ade (with a broken stone doorway) was not reconstructed. A vaulted room (6.2 \u00d7 6.3 m) on the ground floor was still intact in 1820, according to a contemporary drawing. Although the ribs, [[corbel]]s and [[key stone]] were discovered during archeological research, the room was not reconstructed. A spiral stairway had connected the room with the missing higher floors.\n\nThe remaining part of the Stephen's Castle (with the barrel-vaulted rooms behind) has a simple stone fa\u00e7ade with a Gothic doorway. The pointed arch was later restored.\n\n==Interior==\nThe interior from the time of Maria Theresa and Franz Joseph was mostly destroyed during World War II and the post-war reconstruction, excluding the Palatinal Crypt, which survived both. Little information exists about the interiors from the medieval and Baroque eras, but the palace built at the turn of the 20th century was meticulously recorded, using detailed descriptions, photographic documentation and grounds plans. Architect Alajos Hauszmann said about the royal apartments: \"I created a {{convert|200|m|ft|-1|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} long series of rooms, longer than any similar royal apartments in continental Europe except [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].\"\n\nA series of rooms from the medieval castle were unearthed and reconstructed during the post-war rebuilding of Buda Castle in 1958\u201362. They are now part of the permanent exhibition of the Budapest History Museum in \"Building E\" of Buda Castle.\n\n===Medieval period===\n\n====Architectural context====\nOnly a fragment of the medieval castle survived the destruction of 1686\u20131715. The surviving rooms are not considered the most important ones; and none of the more famous rooms and buildings mentioned in the medieval sources exist today. The rooms which were unearthed after 1946 were only saved by chance and by their geographical position at a lower level than the newly created Baroque terrace. The Gothic Hall and the Palace Chapel were built by King Sigismund Luxemburg at the beginning of the 15th century. The castle wing is surrounded by a complex system of medieval fortifications.\n\n====Castle chapel====\n[[File:Buda castle interior church.JPG|thumb|The lower chapel of the medieval castle]]\nThe first chapel in the castle was probably built in the 14th century during the reign of Louis I of Hungary. Eberhard Windecke claimed in his Chronicle that [[Charles II of Hungary]] was murdered in 1386 in a room from which the royal chapel could be seen. The chapel was again mentioned in the Chronicle of [[Lorenzo de Monacis]], which was written around 1390.\n\nKing Sigismund of Luxemburg thoroughly rebuilt the old Anjou castle during the first decades of the 15th century. He erected a Gothic church in place of the former chapel. The Anjou castle's fa\u00e7ade was now facing towards the inner palace courtyard, and the long chancel was projecting from the eastern side of the palace. The [[chancel]] was built upon a lower church due to a lack of space on the narrow plateau. The church had a {{convert|21|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|0}} nave and an {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|0}} chancel. The [[flamboyant]] Royal Church of Buda Castle was similar to the more famous [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.\n\nArcheological research proved the date of the church, because 15th-century strata were discovered under the intact brick floor of the lower church.<ref>L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Zolnay: A budai v\u00e1r, Bp: 1981, p. 60</ref>\n\nIn November 1489, Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the Ottoman Empire sent the relics of [[John the Merciful|John the Almoner]] to King Matthias Corvinus. The King placed the relics in the Royal Chapel, which was re-dedicated and embellished with Renaissance furniture. In 1526, Buda was plundered by the Ottoman Turks after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. The relics were rescued in time and carried to [[Pressburg]], where they are still kept currently. A surviving church inventory from 1530 shows a wealth of furnishings. Later, King [[J\u00e1nos Szapolyai]] converted the lower church into a bastion. The large Gothic windows were walled up; and only the rectangular arrow slits were left open.\n\nIn 1541 the Ottoman Turks captured Buda without resistance, and the Royal Church ceased to be a place of Christian worship. The upper church was destroyed in the 1686 siege of Buda, and the ruins were demolished in 1715. The vault of the lower church collapsed, and the interior was filled with rubbish. The remains were then buried under the new Baroque terrace for two centuries.\n\nThe ruins of the lower church were discovered by archeologists in 1949\u201350. The remains were buried in 1953 because of conceptional disputes about the possible reconstruction. The chapel, finally reconstructed by 1963, was re-consecrated in 1990.\n\n====Gothic Hall====\nThe Gothic Hall is one of the most important surviving examples of secular Gothic architecture in Central Europe. It was built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg in the early 15th century as an extension of the earlier [[Anjou]] palace. It was built on the southern edge of the natural rock plateau of Castle Hill. The level difference between the plateau and the southern court was about {{convert|2.79|m|ft|1}}. A vaulted cellar was built under the hall to span this difference.\n\nThe Gothic Hall is an irregular rectangle of {{convert |20.2|xx|11.55|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a closed niche on the eastern side, which is the inside of the balcony tower. It is divided into two naves with Gothic [[rib vault]]s. The vaults are supported by two massive pillars which come up through the floor from the cellar beneath the room, and in addition, half-pillars in the corners support the ribs. All six vaults are quadripartite, and the two on the inner side are irregularly shaped.\n\nThe hall has four windows, two on the southern side and two on the eastern side, with stone benches in the window niches. The Hall was connected to the palace through a door in the northern wall, supposedly on the place of the original doorway. The northern section of the floor is three steps higher.\n\n[[File:Schedel chapel.JPG|thumb|Buda Castle in the [[Middle Ages]], from the Chronicles of [[Hartmann Schedel]]. The castle church, dedicated to St. John the Almoner, is indicated by the blue rectangle.]]All the newly built side walls were plastered and painted white, while the original stone surfaces were left uncovered. The ribs, pillars, arches and window niches were restored by sculptor Ern\u0151 Szak\u00e1l in 1961\u201362. The ribs have a simple profile, but fragments of a more complicated type were also found in the rubble, together with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s. These pieces supposedly belonged to another stately hall situated above the room, but they were built into the reconstructed vaults by restorers in the 20th-century.\n\nThe northern pillar of the Gothic Hall was already discovered by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century. The remains were buried under the outbuildings of the Royal Gardens, and Hauszmann protected the medieval pillar by building a brick shaft around it.\n\n====Barrel-vaulted rooms====\nThree interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms belong to the oldest part of the palace, Stephen's Castle, which was built by Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, in the 14th century. The northern room is larger ({{convert|6.62|xx|9.42|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) than the southern ones ({{convert|5|xx|4.55|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The northern room is covered by an east-west axial vault while the southern rooms have north-south axial vaults.\n\nThe southern room is connected to the inner courtyard by a doorway. There is a small window high on the western wall. The middle room has a similar window. The larger northern room has three slit windows, one facing west and two facing north, all had iron rails. The rooms were connected to each other with carved Gothic corbel doors. The walls were originally plastered. In the southern room, a medieval stairway led to a [[trapdoor]] and a medieval toilet hidden in the empty space between the walls of the castle and the keep.\n\nThe barrel vaulted rooms were supposedly used as a prison in the Middle Ages. Later the southern vaults collapsed. The intact barrel vault of the northern room was broken by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century when he filled the cellar with rubble. The barrel-vaulted rooms were restored in 1958\u20131962.\n\n====Albrecht Cellar====\nA medieval cellar north of the barrel-vaulted rooms, later called ''Albrecht pince'' (Albrecht Cellar), is covered with a Gothic brick barrel vault. The walls are blackened from burning. The cellar was probably built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg as the ''Cisterna Regia'', i.e. the great underground [[cistern]] of the palace.\n\nThe Cisterna Regia was situated under the former northern zwinger of the palace. This small rectangular courtyard became a private royal garden during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The private garden was an early Renaissance ''giardino segreto'' (hidden garden). It was designed by architect [[Chimenti Camicia]] in the 1470s. A well in the middle of the garden was fed by the cistern underneath.\n\nThe hidden garden, the well and the cistern survived the 1686 siege of Buda. They were indicated on the plans of the area drawn by military architect Joseph de Ha\u00fcy in 1687. In 1715\u20131724 the former Cisterna Regia became the cellar of the new Baroque palace. A section of this room was later used as an ice chamber.\n\n====King's Cellar====\nThe King's Cellar (''Kir\u00e1ly pince'') is not a medieval structure, but a Baroque-era brick cellar under the Danube side of Building E. It was filled with tons of earth and rubble, and the original eastern fa\u00e7ade of the medieval royal palace survived under the fill. The inner walls of the Baroque palace were actually built upon the old fa\u00e7ade. Only the {{convert|7|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|0}} basement section of the original fa\u00e7ade remained.\n\nThis wing was built by King Sigismund of Luxenburg in the early 15th century and was rebuilt by King Matthias Corvinus 50 years later. The surviving eastern fa\u00e7ade was built from large, finely carved blocks of stone. It followed the contour of Castle Hill with a break in the middle. A [[buttress]] was added and a rectangular tower with two buttresses on its corners. The lower part of a balcony on the tower was reconstructed, with three elegant Gothic corbels decorated with cusps.\n\nIt was not possible to demolish the King's Cellar because the whole Baroque palace was resting upon it; the inner fill was removed in 1961. The medieval fa\u00e7ade was reconstructed inside the cellar space between 1961 and 1965. Large windows were cut in the outer wall of the cellar to let in the daylight. Currently, the architectural history of the palace is discernible by viewing the interwoven layers of the past.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny chose the King's Cellar as the place to announce the list of the \"most important public works projects\", financed by European Union funds between 2007 and 2013.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n=== Baroque and Historicism ===\n\n==== Old ceremonial rooms ====\nThe old ceremonial rooms were as follows:\n\n===== \"Zenta\" Room =====\n[[File:Zenta Eloterem.png|thumb|The Zenta Room]]\nThe \"Zenta\" Room (''\"Zenta\" el\u0151terem'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the audience antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the central wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the large painting of the Battle of Zenta contained therein.\n\n===== Audience Antechamber =====\n[[File:Fogadasi Varoterem.png|thumb|left|The Audience Antechamber]]\nThe Audience Antechamber (''Fogad\u00e1si v\u00e1r\u00f3terem'') was situated north of the ballroom on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Antichambre Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin'' (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Antechamber\"). The room gave access to Maria Theresa's private apartments from the ballroom. In the early 1900s, the audience antechamber became part of the ceremonial apartments and had the same white-golden Rococo stucco decoration as the white antechamber on the other side.\n\n===== Grand Throne Room =====\n[[File:Buda Castle nagyterem-mj.jpg|thumb|The Grand Throne Room (c. 1894)]]\nThe Grand Throne Room (''Nagy tr\u00f3nterem''), formerly known as the ballroom (''Nagyterem''), on the first floor of the Baroque wing had several layers of Baroque decoration from the second half of the 18th and the 19th century. Two surviving drawings record the oldest form of the room. Jakob Schmutzer's drawing from 1777 shows the opening ceremony of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University after it was moved to the palace. The room had a Late Baroque decoration with double grooved [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster]]s between the windows and stucco garlands. The walls were decorated with [[Vinzenz Fischer]]'s frescoes of the four faculties. J\u00f3zsef Pollencig's drawing from 1795 shows a ball scene in the \"Prunksaal\". The pilasters were kept, but the frescoes were already covered, and the whole room was stuccoed. On the vault the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary can be seen. After the destruction of the 1849 siege, the room was redecorated in Neo-Baroque style. In 1892 the old ballroom was rebuilt with a new ceiling and a gallery towards the Lions Court; three of its side walls were preserved. It was enlarged again after 1896. The function of the ballroom was given to another new hall and this room was converted into the main throne hall instead. In the early 1900s, the room had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with three large chandeliers.\n\nVinzenz Fischer's frescoes were re-discovered in 1953 during the post-war reconstruction. In spite of this, all the decoration layers were destroyed. Today it houses the Gothic altar collection of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]].\n\n===== White Antechamber =====\n[[File:Feher Eloterem.png|thumb|left|The White Antechamber]]\nThe White Antechamber (''Feh\u00e9r el\u0151terem'') is on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated south of the throne room. In the Baroque era it was called ''Zweytes Antichambre'' (\"second antechamber\"). In the early 1900s it had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a white Rococo stove.\n\n===== \"Coronation\" Room =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Koronazas Eloterem.png|thumb|The Coronation Room]]\nThe \"Coronation\" Room (''\"Koron\u00e1z\u00e1s\" el\u0151terem''), also on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the white antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the southern wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the painting of Franz Joseph I's coronation as [[King of Hungary]] after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\n==== Old royal apartments ====\nThe old royal apartments are as follows:\n\n===== Small Throne Room =====\n[[File:Kis Tronterem.jpg|thumb|left|The Small Throne Room]]\nThe Small Throne Room (''Kis tr\u00f3nterem''), which was situated next to the Audience Antechamber on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Audienz-Zimmer'' and was part of the Empress' private apartments. In Hauszmann's time it was converted into the throne room of the palace, with a simple Baroque throne under a [[baldachin]]. It had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo [[cocklestove]].\n\n===== \"Circle\" Tearoom =====\n[[File:Circle Teaszalon.png|thumb|The \"Circle\" Tearoom]]\nThe \"Circle\" Tearoom (''\"Circle\" teaszalon'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and situated next to the small throne room, in the corner of the southern wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Gesellschaft Zimmer Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin'' (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Parlour\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo [[cocklestove]]. The furniture consisted of a Rococo parlour suite.\n\n===== Antechamber =====\n[[File:Eloszoba 25.png|thumb|left|Antechamber, former dressing room of the Queen]]\nThe Antechamber was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated next to the \"circle\" tearoom with two windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called ''Ankleide-Zimmer Ihrer Majest\u00e4t der Kaiserin'' (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Dressing Room\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. It was connected to another small room, the ''Frauen Kammer''. In Hauszmann's time the walls were largely clad with wallpaper. The furniture consisted of a Rococo [[cocklestove]], chairs and paintings. The last small room of the Empress, the former ''Schreib cabinet'' (\"writing room\"), with one window opening on to the Danube, later became a simple passageway.\n\n===== Smoking Room =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Dohanyzo Szalon.png|thumb|The Smoking Salon, former bedchamber of Queen Maria Theresa]]\nThe Smoking Room (''Doh\u00e1nyz\u00f3 szalon'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated in the middle of the Danube side of the old palace. In the Baroque era it was called ''Schlafzimmer Ihrer k.k. Majest\u00e4ten'' (\"The Imperial Couple's Bedroom\"). It was the only common room of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I. In the early 1900s, the walls were largely hung with wallpaper. The furniture consisted of a Rococo parlour suite and paintings. In the old imperial apartments only the ceilings had the typically white-golden stucco decoration, used in the old ceremonial apartments.\n\n===== Writing Room =====\n[[File:Iroszoba.png|thumb|left|The Writing Room]]\nThe Writing Room (''\u00cdr\u00f3szoba'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was formerly part of the private apartments of Francis I. One window opened to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called ''Ankleidecabinet S.M. des Kaisers'' (\"Emperor's Dressing Room\"). It was connected to another small room, the second dressing room. Later, the imperial dressing room was divided with a wall; with half being converted into a simple passageway, the other into a small writing room. In the early 1900s the latter's walls were largely clad with a very ornate Rococo wallpaper. It had a white marble mantelpiece with a large Rococo mirror above.\n\n===== Parlour =====\n[[File:Tarsalkodo Terem.png|thumb|The Parlour]]\nThe Parlour (''T\u00e1rsalkod\u00f3 terem''), on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was part of the private apartments of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]. It was situated in the corner of the southern wing with 2+3 windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era the room was divided with a wall, one half named ''Empfangs Zimmer S.M. des Kaisers'' (\"Imperial Audience Room\"), the other ''Arbeits Cabinet'' (\"Study\"). In Hauszmann's time, it was converted to a great parlour with wallpaper clad walls, a Rococo cocklestove, a chandelier, paintings, chairs and a mirror.\n\n===== Antechamber =====\n[[File:Eloszoba 29.png|thumb|left|last Antechamber]]\nThe Antechamber, on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was the last room of the former private apartments of Francis I. In the Baroque era it was called ''Zweytes Audienz Zimmer'' (\"second audience room\"). In Hauszmann's time the walls were mainly clad with wallpaper, and it had a Rococo cocklestove, a chandelier, paintings and chairs.\n\n====South Wing====\nThe rooms of the south wing are as follows:\n\n===== Baroque Court =====\nThe Baroque Court (''Barokk udvar''), a rectangular court, which is the oldest part of the Baroque palace. Here the original 18\u201319th century fa\u00e7ades survived, and in 1997 the court was covered with a glass roof and became the main exhibition hall of the Budapest History Museum.\n\n===== King's Staircase =====\n[[File:Kir\u00e1lyl\u00e9pcs\u0151 bej\u00e1rata.png|thumb|upright|Entrance to the King's Staircase]]\nThe King's Staircase (''Kir\u00e1ly-l\u00e9pcs\u0151''), the Baroque main staircase of the southern wing gave access to the private apartments of Emperor Francis I. Both the King's Staircase and its northern twin, the Diplomat's Staircase, had ornate gates opening onto Lions Court, decorated with [[telamon]]s. The kitchens were originally situated on the ground floor of the southern wing, but they were relocated by Hauszmann.\n\n==== Central Wing ====\nThe central wing had the following rooms:\n\n===== Diplomat's Staircase =====\nThe Diplomat's Staircase (''Diplomata-l\u00e9pcs\u0151'') was the Baroque main staircase of the central (originally northern) wing and gave access to the private apartments of Maria Theresa. In the 18th century there was an officer's dining room and a smaller kitchen on the ground floor and another dining room with a cafe kitchen on the first floor. The southern and northern (later central) wings had the same ground plan: all the rooms opened from a passageway running along the sides of a rectangular central court. The two monumental stairways were rebuilt by Hauszmann in Neo-Baroque style.\n\n===== St Stephen's Chapel =====\n[[File:Kapolna Buda varpalota.jpg|thumb|upright|St Stephen's Chapel|alt=|left]]\nSt Stephen's Chapel, known before as St. Sigismund Chapel, or Castle Church (''Szent Zsigmond-k\u00e1polna'', ''V\u00e1rtemplom'') was the [[chapel royal]] in the western end of this wing, which had no fa\u00e7ades, only a door opening onto Lions Court (through an antechamber). Construction was finished in 1768 and the church was consecrated in 1769. The ground plan was drawn by Nicolaus Pacassi, with the interior was designed by his follower, Franz Anton Hillebrandt. The ground plan followed a typical \"violin\" form favoured in the Baroque church architecture of Central Europe at that time. It had a rectangular chancel and a nave with four bays for side altars. On the first and the second floors two oratories opened into the chancel and a two-storey high gallery was situated above the entrance. In 1777\u201378 a new door was opened in the first side bay to give access to the new chapel of the Holy Right. An engraving from 1771 to 1780 shows the original interior design in its completed form: double pilasters, windows with segmental arches, stucco and false marble decoration, double oratory windows and a doorway with a stucco veil drawn aside by flying [[Putto|putti]]. The church was slightly rebuilt by Hauszmann, who demolished the Chapel of the Holy Right in 1899 and built a new chapel for the relic behind the chancel (converting a small recess). This chapel was decorated with the golden Venetian mosaics of [[K\u00e1roly Lotz]]. A new Neo-Baroque main altar was built in the church in 1899.\n\n20th-century photos testify that the church survived in its Baroque form until the war. During a siege, the vaults of the church partially collapsed and the furniture was plundered. The Castle Church was left decaying for more than a decade. In 1957 the remaining two vaults collapsed, and the church was totally destroyed and converted to exhibition spaces. The altar table was rescued and re-erected in [[Pilisv\u00f6r\u00f6sv\u00e1r]] in 1957. The Lotz mosaics from the Chapel of the Holy Right were also rescued and re-assembled in [[Balatonalm\u00e1di]].\n\n===== Palatinal Crypt =====\n[[File:Jozsefnador palatin Hungary tombstone.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary]] in the Palatinal Crypt]]\nThe [[Palatinal Crypt]] (''N\u00e1dori kripta'') was under the former palace chapel and is the only surviving room of the whole Royal Castle. The underground crypt was first used as a burial place between 1770 and 1777. In August 1820, Elisabeth Karoline, Palatine Joseph's infant daughter was buried in the crypt. Seventeen years later, the Palatine's 13-year-old son Alexander Leopold followed. Palatine Joseph decided to convert the crypt into a family mausoleum and commissioned Franz H\u00fcppmann with the task. The work was finished in 1838, and other members of the Palatine's family were reburied here. Palatine Joseph himself was interred on 13 January 1847. The crypt was continuously used by the Hungarian branch of the Habsburg family. It was repeatedly restored and enriched with new works of art, frescoes, statues and ornate stone sarcophagi, made by renowned artists of the 19th century. The last member of the family buried there was Archduchess Klotild in 1927. The crypt survived the war unscathed and was spared during the post-war reconstruction.\n\nThe crypt was looted in 1966 and 1973 (during the construction works), when some corpses were thrown out of the sarcophagi by the thieves. The human remains were later identified and reburied. The crypt was restored in 1985\u20131987. Since then the Palatinal Crypt is part of the exhibition of the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\n====North Wing====\n\n===== Lobby =====\nThe main lobby (''El\u0151csarnok'') of the Royal Palace was situated in Hauszmann's Northern Wing On the Danube side. It was a long, rectangular hall divided into four sections with free standing [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and two square pillars. The section at the southern end was elevated a few steps. Nine arched windows opened towards the Danube. In the middle of the other sidewall, a doorway led to the inner courtyard. The walls and the ceiling were stuccoed. The southern elevation was closed off with a stone balustrade between the pillars and the wall. The ornate lobby was designed for important state ceremonies.\n\n===== Grand Ballroom =====\n[[File:Nagy Balterem.png|thumb|left|The Grand Ballroom]]\nThe Grand Ballroom (''Nagy b\u00e1lterem''), in the middle part of the northern wing, took over the function of the smaller old ballroom in the Baroque wing. Designed by Hauszmann, it was the most splendid room of the palace. The two-storey high, airy room was lavishly decorated with stuccoes, half columns, trabeation, balconies and six crystal chandeliers in Neo-Baroque style. Seven arched windows and doorways opened towards a pillared terrace facing the western forecourt. On the other side, the ballroom was connected to the Buffet Hall through three doors.\n\nPhotos made after the war show the room with its vaulted ceiling collapsed. The ballroom was not restored but totally destroyed in the course of the post-war remodelling.\n\n===== Dining Hall =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Buffet Csarnok.png|thumb|The Dining Hall]]\nThe Dining Hall (''Buffet-csarnok''), on the Danube side of the northern wing, was a very long hall used for state banquets. It was connected to the Great Ballroom nearby and it was possible to join them together. There was a shorter, passage-like space between the two rooms. This passage was separated from the Buffet Hall by six square pillars, while its other side was a solid wall with three doors. On the eastern side of the Buffet Hall a long row of windows opened towards the Danube and a pillared terrace. The Buffet Hall was divided into three sections with free-standing Ionic columns, holding trabeations. The vaulted ceiling was lavishly decorated with frescoes and stuccoes.\n\n===== Habsburg Hall =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kir\u00e1lyi Palota, Habsburg Nagyterem.png|thumb|left|The Habsburg Hall]]\nThe Habsburg Hall (''Habsburg terem'') was situated in the middle of the long palace complex, under Hauszmann's (false) dome, where the new northern wing and the old palace met. Although this part of the building belonged to the original palace, it was thoroughly rebuilt by Hauszmann\u2013this stately room was totally his own work. It was one of the three historical rooms of the palace representing the important periods of Hungarian history. A free-standing, double flight of steps, called the Habsburg Steps, connected the room with the Royal Gardens on the Danube terrace. The room had lavish Baroque decorations with half-pillars and gilded stuccoes. The vaulted ceiling was decorated with K\u00e1roly Lotz's fresco ''Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty''. K\u00e1roly Senyei's four [[Carrara marble]] busts stood in front of the sidewalls representing King Charles III, Queen Maria Theresa, King Franz Joseph and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Queen Elisabeth]].\n\nThe Habsburg Hall survived World War II relatively undamaged, but in the 1950s it was demolished for political reasons.\n\n====Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing====\n[[File:Budapest, Budav\u00e1ri Palota.jpg|thumb|Wing facing the district of Krisztinav\u00e1ros]]\nThe Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing faces the district of [[Krisztinav\u00e1ros]], which was named in honour of the daughter of Queen Maria Theresa, Archduchess [[Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen]].\n\n===== Entrance hall =====\nThe entrance hall (''El\u0151csarnok'') opened from Lions Court, under an arcaded Neo-Renaissance portico, through ornate wrought-iron doors. This now serves as the entrance of the [[Hungarian National Library]]. The hall was a long, oblong-shaped room with 4+4 free standing Ionic columns in front of the walls on the longer sides, holding a trabeation. In the end of the shorter sides two doors opened into antechambers. The three arcaded doorways on the longer side opened into a lobby. The ceiling of the hallway was stuccoed, and the whole design was Italian Renaissance in style.\n\n===== Lobby =====\n[[File:Lepcsohaz.jpg|thumb|The Grand Staircase]]\nThe lobby (''El\u0151csarnok'') was connected to the hall of the main staircase through pillars. The stuccoed ceiling was held up by two rectangular pillars. The apartments of Archduke J\u00f3zsef \u00c1gost and his wife, Archduchess Auguszta, were situated on the ground floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing and opened from this room. Now it serves as the lobby of the Hungarian National Library in a radically modernised form.\n\n===== Main Staircase =====\nThe monumental main staircase (''F\u0151l\u00e9pcs\u0151h\u00e1z''), with three flights, led up from the lobby to the first floor in an airy, glass-roofed hall. The side walls of the hall were decorated in Italian Renaissance style with colossal Corinthian half-columns, stuccoes and lunette openings. Ornate wrought-iron chandeliers and intricate balustrades decorated the stairs. On the ground floor, colossal [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlas statues]] stood beside the side pillars, holding the weight of the upper flights. The marble statues were the works of J\u00e1nos Fadrusz from 1897. During the post-war reconstruction the main staircase was radically modernised. Only the two colossal Atlas statues survived. Now they are standing somewhat incongruently near their original places.\n\n===== St Stephen's Room =====\n[[File:Szent Istvan Terem.png|thumb|left|St Stephen's Room]]\nSt Stephen's Room (''\"Szent Istv\u00e1n\" terem''), on the first floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, was one of the \"historical rooms\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. Together with the Matthias Room and the Habsburg Room, they represented the three most important periods of [[History of Hungary|Hungarian history]]. Saint Stephen's Room connected the new Private Royal Apartments and\u2014through a very long passageway\u2014the Old Royal Apartments in the Danube Wing. Its style evoked the age of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1ds]], the first Hungarian dynasty in the early Middle Ages. The walls were clad with dark carved wood paneling. The most spectacular item was a large stone mantelpiece with [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] architectural details and the bust of King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]], the first king of Hungary. The room was furnished with medieval-looking metal chandeliers and heavy wooden furniture.\n\n===== Matthias Room =====\n[[File:Matyas Terem 1903.jpg|thumb|Matthias Room]]\nMatthias Room (''M\u00e1ty\u00e1s terem'') was named after King [[Matthias Corvinus]], who ruled in the late Middle Ages. It was one of the three \"historical rooms\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. The room opened from the Royal Bedroom, at the end of the line of private apartments. It had three windows opening towards the hills of Buda. There was a long terrace in front of the room. The style of the Matthias Room was [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], with carved wooden paneling and a coffered ceiling. It was furnished with a mantelpiece in the corner and two chandeliers, the most spectacular item being the equestrian statue of King Matthias, sculpted by J\u00e1nos Fadrusz. The statue was a miniature copy of the original standing on the main square of [[Kolozsv\u00e1r]] (now Cluj-Napoca). This copy was saved after the war and put on display in the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\n===== Strong Room =====\n[[File:Kir\u00e1lyi Palota b\u00e1lterme, a k\u00f6zszeml\u00e9re helyezett Szent Korona \u00e9s a koron\u00e1z\u00e1si \u00e9kszerek. Fortepan 23009.jpg|thumb|Hungarian Crown Jewels on display at the Strong Room]]\nThe Hungarian crown jewels were kept in the specially-designed Strong Room (''P\u00e1nc\u00e9lterem'') on the second floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing. The [[Crown of Saint Stephen]] was kept here between 1900 and 1944.\n\n===== Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum =====\nThe small Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum (''Erzs\u00e9bet Kir\u00e1lyn\u00e9 Eml\u00e9km\u00fazeum'') on the second floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing was established in remembrance of Queen Elisabeth after her murder in 1898. Memorabilia were collected by Ida Ferenczy, Elisabeth's former [[lady-in-waiting]], Viscountess Pallavicini and Countess Ilona Batthy\u00e1ny. The museum opened on 15 January 1908 as an affiliate of the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. The collection contained personal items, letters and clothes. Its most important relic was the costume that Elisabeth had been wearing when she was murdered. One room was meticulously recreated as the Queen's own writing room with her original writing desk and her 219 Hungarian books. The museum was badly damaged during World War II,<ref name=\"UNESCO\">\"Budapest including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle\", UNESCO.hu, 2010.</ref> and the surviving relics were bestowed to other museums.\n\n====Private royal apartments====\n\n===== Royal Entrance Hall =====\n[[File:I. Fejedelmi eloterem 54.jpg|thumb|The Entrance Hall]]\nThe Royal Entrance Hall (''Fejedelmi el\u0151terem''), on the first floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing, gave access to the rooms of the Private Royal Apartments of King Franz Joseph I. The private apartments were situated in the southwestern part of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, their windows opening towards the hills of Buda. The Royal Entrance Hall was connected through a wide passageway to the main staircase hall. The spacious, oblong-shaped hall was divided in three, with two pairs of Ionic marble columns supporting [[architrave]]s. The central part of the room was much longer than the bays at the ends. Doors connected the hall with the rooms of the private apartments. In the middle of the longer wall stood an ornate stone mantelpiece with the bust of Franz Joseph. On the other side, three windows opened to the inner courtyard of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing. The ceiling was stuccoed and the side walls of the hall were covered with marble.\n\n===== Antechamber =====\n[[File:Eloterem 58.jpg|thumb|left|Antechamber]]\nThe antechamber (''El\u0151terem'') of the private apartments opened from the Royal Entrance Hall. It had three windows facing toward the hills. The room had a typical [[Biedermeier]] white-golden stucco decoration with floral wallpapers, resembling to the cosy rooms of [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]]. All the rooms of the private apartments followed this Viennese style favoured by the King. The antechamber was furnished with a stone mantelpiece (with a mirror above), an [[Empire (style)|Empire]] crystal chandelier, a stone flowerpot standing on a fluted column and Neo-Renaissance table with chairs.\n\n===== Audience Room =====\n[[File:Fogadoszoba 59.jpg|thumb|The Audience Room]]\nThe audience room (''Fogad\u00f3szoba'') of Franz Joseph I was situated in a corner of the private apartments wing, with two windows opening southwards and three windows opening westwards. It had a beautiful stuccoed and frescoed ceiling. The walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, a golden Rococo console table with a large mirror and a parlour suite.\n\n===== Writing Room =====\n[[File:Iroszoba 60.png|thumb|left|Writing room in the royal suite]]\nThe writing room (''\u00cdr\u00f3szoba'') of Franz Joseph had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white cocklestove, a table and chairs. To the right and left two similar parlours opened from the room.\n\n===== Royal Bedroom =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, I. Fejedelmi Haloszoba.png|thumb|Bedroom of the king]]\nThe bedroom (''Fejedelmi h\u00e1l\u00f3szoba'') of the king had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, the baldachined royal bed and a [[folding screen]]. The bedroom was connected to a dressing room, a private bathroom and smaller rooms belonging to the butler and the servants.\n\n===== Royal Dining Hall =====\n[[File:I. Fejedelmi Ebedlo 57.jpg|thumb|left|The Dining Room]]\nThe Royal Dining Hall (''Fejedelmi eb\u00e9dl\u0151'') opened from the Royal Entrance Hall, and it was the largest room of the private apartments. The long hall had six windows opening towards [[Gell\u00e9rt Hill]]. Three crystal chandeliers gave light to the elegant stuccoed space. In the middle of the longer side wall, between the two doors, stood a marble mantelpiece.\n\n===== \"Circle\" Room =====\n[[File:Circle Terem 56.jpg|thumb|The \"Circle\" Room]]\nThe \"Circle\" Room (''\"Circle\" terem'') opened from the Royal Dining Hall. It was the last room of the private apartments on the southern side, with three windows opening towards Gell\u00e9rt Hill. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white cocklestove and chairs.\n\n===== Dining Room =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Ebedlo.png|thumb|left|The Dining Room in the royal guest suite]]\nThe small dining room (''Eb\u00e9dl\u0151'') was situated in the northern part of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, among the other rooms of the Royal Guest Suite. Four windows opened towards Krisztinav\u00e1ros. The ceiling was stuccoed, while the walls were covered with carved wooden panelling and wallpaper. A stone mantelpiece and large painting above it (depicting a hunting scene with a deer) gave a homey feeling to the room. It was furnished with a crystal chandelier and a long dining table with 12 chairs.\n\n==== Archducal Apartments ====\nThese apartments, on the ground floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing, were designed in 1902 for [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] (1872\u20131962), the head of the Hungarian branch of the Habsburgs and his wife, [[Princess Auguste of Bavaria (1875\u20131964)|Archduchess Augusta]] (1875\u20131964). They could be reached from the lobby of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing through a long passageway. The most important rooms were (in due course): the ''salon'', where guests were entertained; the ''great parlour''; ''parlour''; ''dining room''; the ''Archduke's study''; the ''Archduke's bedroom''; the ''Archduchess' bedroom''; the ''Archduchess' study''; and the ''breakfast parlour''. All rooms had a relatively simple decoration with white stuccoed ceilings and stucco panels above the doorways. The walls were covered with wallpaper. Crystal chandeliers, stone mantelpieces and typical turn-of-the-century furniture gave the rooms a homey ambiance. The great parlour was decorated with large paintings.\n\n==Works of art==\nThe castle and its gardens have been decorated with works of art since their foundation in the 14th century. Only written sources speak about the most important medieval works, but detailed pictorial and written information exists about the 19th-century artistic decoration of the palace, which was mainly created by the most important Hungarian artists of the era. Many of the statues survived the destruction during the siege of Budapest in 1944\u201345 and were later restored. On the other hand, important works of art were destroyed during the controversial reconstruction of the castle during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n===Sculptural monuments===\n[[File:Budapest, Castle Hill, 1014 Hungary - panoramio (36).jpg|thumb|Matthias Fountain|alt=|255x255px]]\n;Matthias Fountain (''M\u00e1ty\u00e1s k\u00fatja'')\nThe spectacular fountain decorates the western forecourt of the palace. It shows a group of hunters led by King Matthias Corvinus together with hounds, a killed deer, Galeotto Marzio with a hawk and Sz\u00e9p Ilonka with a doe. This group of people stands between fallen rocks with water running down into a basin. The fountain was made by sculptor Alajos Str\u00f3bl. The dead deer was modelled upon a majestic stag killed in 1896 by poachers in the forest owned by Str\u00f3bl. The damaged sculpture was restored after the war. Nowadays it is probably the most photographed object in the palace.\n\n;Monument of Prince Eugene of Savoy\nThe equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy stands on the Danube terrace, in a prominent position, high above Budapest. The Neo-Baroque statue was made by sculptor [[J\u00f3zsef R\u00f3na]] for the town of [[Senta|Zenta]], but the town could not afford the price. The monument was bought in 1900 as a temporary solution until the planned equestrian statue of King Franz Joseph was completed. This never happened, so Prince Eugen remained on his plinth. The plinth is decorated with two bronze reliefs showing the capture of the earth-works in Zenta and the decisive cavalry charge in the Battle of Zenta in 1697.\n\n[[File:Budapest princ Eugen 1.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of Prince Eugene of Savoy[[File:Turul and Hungarian flag.jpg|thumb|left|The mythological [[Turul]] bird]]]][[File:Csik\u00f3s statue by Gy\u00f6rgy Vastagh, Hunyadi Courtyard, Royal Palace. 2009 BudapestDSCN3859.jpg|thumb|Statue of the horseherd|alt=|240x240px]]\n;Horseherd (''Csik\u00f3s'')\nThe statue of the [[Hortob\u00e1gy National Park]] horseherd taming a wild horse originally stood in front of the Riding School in the former \u00dajvil\u00e1g terrace. It is the work of Gy\u00f6rgy Vastagh from 1901. The statue was displayed in the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris (1900). The damaged statue was removed during the 1960s, but it was later restored and erected in the western forecourt of the palace in 1983, next to the Matthias Fountain.\n\n;Turulbird (''Turulmad\u00e1r'')\nThe mythological Turul, high above the Danube, was made by [[Gyula Don\u00e1th]] in 1905. The plinth and the ornate Neo-Baroque rail ([[Gyula Jungfer]]'s work) was seriously damaged during the siege of Buda, but they were restored in 1981, together with the broken coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary on the plinth.\n\n[[File:BudapestDSCN3839.JPG|thumb|''Fishing Children'' by K\u00e1roly Senyei]]\n;Fishing Children\nThe Fountain of the Fishing Children on the Danube terrace is the work of sculptor K\u00e1roly Senyei from 1912. It depicts two children grappling with a fish. The fine workmanship of the fishing net is remarkable. The fountain was removed in 1955 and re-erected at R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Square in Pest, but brought back to its original place in 1976. It was restored in 2001.\n\n;Csongor and T\u00fcnde\nThe two statues depicting Csongor and T\u00fcnde, literary figures from [[Mih\u00e1ly V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty]]'s drama, originally decorated the Habsburg Steps in front of the palace. They are the works of sculptor [[Mikl\u00f3s Ligeti]] from 1903. The steps were demolished after the war, but the statues were saved and re-erected in 1976 on top of two simple concrete plinths near their original locations.\n\n;Lions\nTwo pairs of lions guard the monumental gate leading into Lions Court. The four statues are the works of J\u00e1nos Fadrusz from 1901. The animals standing on the outer side of the gate are calm and dignified, while the inner ones are menacing. One lion was broken in two pieces during the war, but it was recreated in the 1950s.\n\n;War and Peace\n\n[[File:V\u00e1rbels\u0151.jpg|thumb|left|One of the lions in the inner courtyard]]\nThe monumental allegorical bronze statues of War and Peace stand beside the entrance to the Budapest History Museum. They are the work of K\u00e1roly Senyei. Both War and Peace are represented by angels, one with a trumpet, the other with an olive branch. Under the angel of Peace is a returning soldier, while under the angel of War there is a dead Ottoman soldier and ancient Hungarian warriors.\n\nThere are sepulchral monuments in the Palatinal Crypt decorated with the statues of [[Gy\u00f6rgy Zala (sculptor)|Gy\u00f6rgy Zala]], Alajos Str\u00f3bl and K\u00e1roly Senyei.\n\n== Lost works of art ==\n\n;Hungaria\nThe monumental sculpture group decorated the main (northern) fa\u00e7ade of the palace, facing Szent Gy\u00f6rgy Square. On the top of the attic, crowning the fa\u00e7ade, stood the female figure of Hungaria, the allegorical representation of Hungary. Two semi-nude figures sat at her side, one male and one female, representing Industry and Commerce. The group was made by sculptor Gyula Jankovits in 1905. The sculpture was destroyed, together with the whole northern fa\u00e7ade, during the 1950s.\n\n;Pediment Group\nThe pediment above the Habsburg Steps was decorated with an allegorical group of K\u00e1roly Senyei representing the ''Apotheosis of the Dual Monarchy''. It was destroyed during the 1950s, together with the great coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary which originally crowned the fa\u00e7ade. The present-day pediment is plain, without any sculptural decoration.\n\n;Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty\nThe ceiling of the Habsburg Room was decorated with a fresco representing the apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty. It was the last important work of K\u00e1roly Lotz, painted in 1903, one year before his death. The artist was already seriously ill when he worked on the fresco. The \"Apotheosis\" followed the traditions of Baroque court painting, and the work was praised by contemporary critics. The fresco survived the war unscathed, but it was destroyed in the 1950s.\n\n==Museums and institutions==\n{{Main|Hungarian National Gallery|National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library}}\n[[File:Floor plans of Buda Castle en.svg|thumb|The ground plan of the castle complex, with the location of the museums]]\n[[File:Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest, Hungr\u00eda - panoramio (31).jpg|thumb|Baroque Oroszl\u00e1nos Gate of the Hungarian National Gallery]]\nThe Budapest History Museum is located in the southern wing of Buda Castle, in Building E, over four floors. It presents the history of Budapest from its beginnings until the modern era. The restored part of the medieval castle, including the Royal Chapel and the rib-vaulted Gothic Hall, belongs to the exhibition. The highlights of the exhibition are the Gothic statues of Buda Castle and a 14th-century silk tapestry decorated with the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] coats of arms. Small gardens were recreated in the medieval zwingers around the oldest parts of the building.\n\nThe Hungarian National Gallery is located in Building A, B, C and D. The museum presents the history of Hungarian art from the 11th century until the present, with a special exhibition concentrating on Gothic altarpieces (housed in the former Baroque Ballroom). The only surviving interior from the pre-war Royal Palace, the Palatinal Crypt, belongs to the museum.\n\n\"Building F\" is occupied by the National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library, the national library of Hungary. Its collection of rare and antique books, [[codices]] and manuscripts contains 35 Corvina pieces from the famous library of King Matthias Corvinus. The original Bibliotheca Corviniana was housed in the medieval Royal Castle of Buda.\n\n== The cellars and caves ==\nDuring the Ottoman era, the extensive cave system was utilized by the hunters to store tigers and Hungarian mountain bears.\n\nThe cellars stored an ornate wine collection from the Ergi wine growing region in the Northern frontier of Hungary.\n\n==Honors==\nPostage stamps

It was first completed in 1265, but the massive [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] palace today occupying most of the site was built between 1749 and 1769. The complex in the past was referred to as either the '''Royal Palace''' ({{lang-hu|Kir\u00e1lyi-palota}}) or the '''Royal Castle''' ({{lang-hu|Kir\u00e1lyi V\u00e1r}}, {{lang-de|link=no|K\u00f6nigliche Burg}}). The castle now houses the Hungarian National Gallery and The Budapest History Museum.\n\nBuda Castle sits on the southern tip of [[V\u00e1rhegy|Castle Hill]], surrounded by the touristic area known as [[V\u00e1rnegyed|V\u00e1rnegyed (Castle Quarter)]], which is famous for [[Middle Ages|medieval]], [[Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] houses, churches, public buildings and [[monument]]<nowiki/>s. The hill is linked to [[:hu: Clark \u00c1d\u00e1m t\u00e9r|Clark \u00c1d\u00e1m Square]] and the [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge]] by the [[Budapest Castle Hill Funicular|Castle Hill Funicular]]. The castle is a part of the Budapest [[World Heritage Site]], so declared in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400 |title=Budapest, including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Medieval Royal Palace (Buda Castle)}}\n[[File:Buda 1493.jpg|thumb|Buda Castle in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]\n\n[[File:M\u00e1ty\u00e1s budai v\u00e1ra.jpg|thumb|Eastern view of the Medieval Royal palace (1490s)|alt=|left]]\n[[File:Buda l\u00e1tk\u00e9pe-XVI. sz.jpg|thumb|Southern view of the Medieval Royal palace (1520s)]]\nThe first royal residence on the Castle Hill was built by [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] between 1247 and 1265. It is uncertain whether it was situated on the southern tip of the hill or on the northern elevation, near the Kammerhof.\n\nThe oldest part of the present-day palace was built in the 14th century by [[Stephen, Duke of Slavonia]], who was the younger brother of King [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Only the foundations remain of the [[keep|castle keep]], which was known as '''Stephen's Tower''' (Hungarian: ''Istv\u00e1n-torony''). The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] palace of King Louis I was arranged around a narrow courtyard next to the keep.\n\n[[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] significantly enlarged the palace and strengthened its fortifications. Sigismund, as a [[Holy Roman Emperor]], needed a magnificent royal residence to express his prominence among the rulers of Europe. He chose Buda Castle as his main residence, and during his long reign it became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late [[Middle Ages]]. Buda was an important artistic centre of the [[International Gothic]] style.\n\nConstruction began in the 1410s and was largely finished in the 1420s, although some minor works continued until the death of the king in 1437. The palace was first mentioned in 1437, under the name \"''fricz palotha''\".\n\nThe most important part of Sigismund's palace was the northern wing, known as the Fresh Palace (Hun: ''Friss-palota''). On the top floor was a large hall called the Roman Hall ({{convert|70|xx|20|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with a carved wooden ceiling. Great windows and balconies faced toward the city of [[Buda]]. The fa\u00e7ade of the palace was decorated with statues, a and coat-of-arms. In front stood the bronze [[equestrian statue]] of Sigismund, later repaired by King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]].\n\nThe southern part of the royal residency was surrounded with narrow ''[[zwingers]]''. Two parallel walls, the so-called \"cortina walls\", run down from the palace to the River [[Danube]] across the steep hillside. The most imposing structure, the Broken Tower (Hun: ''Csonka-torony''), on the western side of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', remained unfinished. The basement of the tower was used as a [[dungeon]]; the top floors were probably the treasury of the royal jewels.\n\nThe last phase of large-scale building activity took place under King Matthias Corvinus. During the first decades of his reign the king finished the work on the Gothic palace. The Royal Chapel, with the surviving [[Palace Chapel (Buda Castle)|Lower Church]], was likely built at that time.\n\nAfter the marriage of Matthias and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476, Italian [[humanists]], artists and craftsmen arrived at Buda. The Hungarian capital became the first centre of [[Renaissance]] north of the Alps. The king rebuilt the palace in an early Renaissance style. The ''cour d'honneur'' was modernised and an Italian ''[[loggia]]'' was added. Inside the palace were two rooms with golden ceilings: the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana]] and a passage with the frescoes of the twelve signs of the [[Zodiac]]. The fa\u00e7ade of the palace was decorated with statues of [[John Hunyadi]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hunyadi]] and King Matthias. In the middle of the court there was a fountain with a statue of [[Pallas Athene]].\n\nOnly fragments remain of this Renaissance palace: some red marble balustrades, lintels and decorative glazed tiles from stoves and floors.\n\n[[File:Var rondellecivertanlegi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|The reconstructed medieval fortifications and the Great Rondella]]\nIn the last years of his reign Matthias Corvinus started construction of a new Renaissance palace on the eastern side of the Sigismund Courtyard, next to the Fresh Palace. The '''Matthias Palace''' remained unfinished because of the king's early death. The palace had a monumental red marble stairway in front of the fa\u00e7ade. Matthias Corvinus was usually identified with [[Hercules]] by the humanists of his court; the bronze gates were decorated with panels depicting the deeds of Hercules, and a great bronze statue of the Greek hero welcomed the guests in the [[forecourt]] of the palace complex, where [[jousts]] were held.\n\nThe walled gardens of the palace were laid out on the western slopes of the Castle Hill. In the middle of the enclosure, a Renaissance villa was built by Matthias. Only one column survives of this so-called ''Aula Marmorea''.\n\nAfter the death of Matthias Corvinus, his successor, King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], carried on the works of the '''Matthias Palace''', especially after his marriage with [[Anna of Foix-Candale]] in 1502.\n\nUnder the reign of King [[John Z\u00e1polya]] (the last national ruler of Hungary) the palace was repaired. On the southern tip of the Castle Hill, the Great Rondella was built by Italian military engineers. The circular [[bastion]] is one of the main surviving structure of the old palace.\n\n===Ottoman Era===\n[[File:Buda Citerioris Hungariae Caput Regni avita sedes. vulgo Ofen 1617.jpg|thumb|Georg Houfnagel's view of Buda in 1617|alt=|left]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] collapsed. The [[Ottoman Turks]] occupied the evacuated town on 11 September 1526. Although Buda was sacked and burned, the Royal Palace was not damaged. Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] carried away all the bronze statues (the Hunyadis, Pallas Athene and Hercules) with him to [[Constantinople]]. The statues were destroyed there in a rebellion a few years later. The Sultan also took many volumes from the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana|Corvina library]].\n\nIn 1529 the Ottoman army besieged and occupied Buda again, and the palace was badly damaged. On 29 August 1541 Buda was occupied again by the Ottomans, without any resistance. Buda became part of [[Ottoman Empire]] and the seat of the [[Eyalet]] of Budin. The original German and Hungarian population left the city, immigrants from Ottoman Empire and the Balkan peninsula came to their place.<ref>Oliver A. I. Botar : From European Capital to Ottoman Outpost: The Decline of Buda in the Sixteenth Century, (1987, Spring) LINK: [http://epa.oszk.hu/00000/00010/00016/pdf/HSR_1987_1_003-025.pdf]</ref>\n\nAlthough Turkish travel writers wrote enthusiastically about the beauty of the palace of the Hungarian kings, the new Ottoman government let the palace decay. It was partially used as barracks a storage place and stables, and otherwise it stood empty.\n\nThe palace was called ''I\u00e7 Kala'' (\"Inner Castle\") and ''Hisar Pe\u00e7e'' (\"Citadel\") by the Turks. The name of the ''cour d'honneur'' was ''\"Seray meydani\"''. The favourite nickname of the complex was \"Palace of the Golden Apples\".[[File:Die Einnahme von Buda 1686.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] took [[Buda]] after a long [[Battle of Buda (1686)|siege]] in 1686]]\n\nThe economic decline of [[Buda]] the capital city during the Ottoman conquest characterised by the stagnation of population, the population of Buda was not larger in 1686, than the population of the city two centuries earlier in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andr\u00e1s Ger\u0151, J\u00e1nos Po\u00f3r|title=Budapest: a history from its beginnings to 1998, Volume 86 van Atlantic studies on society in change , Volume 462 van East European monographs|publisher=Social Science Monographs|page=3|year=1997|ISBN=9780880333597|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sONnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22population+of+Buda%22&dq=%22population+of+Buda%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjIufSz26vIAhXEWxoKHVEpAqg}}</ref> The Ottomans allowed the Hungarian royal place to fall into ruins.<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew Wheatcroft|title=The Enemy at the Gate: Habsburgs, Ottomans, and the Battle for Europe|publisher=Basic Books|page=206|year=2010|ISBN=9780465020812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA206 }}</ref> The amortised palace was later transformed into a gunpowder storage and magazine by the Ottomans,<ref>{{cite book|author= Steve Fallon, Sally Schafer|title=Lonely Planet Budapest|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2015|ISBN=9781743605059|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jOJzBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT443 }}</ref> which caused its detonation during the siege in 1686.

Unsuccessful sieges in 1542, 1598, 1603 and 1684 caused serious damage. The Ottoman authorities repaired only the fortifications. According to 17th-century sources, many buildings of the former Royal Palace were roofless and their vaults collapsed. Nonetheless the medieval palace mostly survived until the great siege of 1686.\n\n===Destruction of the medieval castle===\n[[File:Ostrom1686.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|The great siege of Buda (1686); contemporary drawing]]\nThe medieval palace was destroyed in the [[Battle of Buda (1686)|great siege of 1686]] when Buda was captured by allied Christian forces.\n\nIn 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed Western European Christian campaign was started to take the city. This time the Holy League's army was much larger, consisting of 65,000\u2013100,000 men, including German, Hungarian, Croat, Dutch, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers and other Europeans as volunteers, [[artillerymen]] and officers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] defenders consisted of 7,000 men.<ref>{{cite book|last=Young|first=William|title=International Politics and Warfare in the Age of Louis XIV and Peter the Great: A Guide to the Historical Literature|year=2004|publisher=iUniverse|page=433|ISBN=9780595329922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wErzZ_lUWAQC&pg=PA432}}</ref>\n\nIn a heavy artillery bombardment, many buildings burned and collapsed. The Stephen's Tower, used as a [[gunpowder]] store by the Ottomans, exploded when hit by a single cannon, said to have been fired by a [[friar]] called G\u00e1bor, also referred as T\u00fczes G\u00e1bor (\"Gabriel Fiery\"). According to contemporary sources, the explosion killed as many as 1,500 Turkish soldiers and caused a wave on the Danube that washed away artillery batteries and guards standing on the opposite shore.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nHabsburg military engineers made several plans and drawings of the buildings in subsequent decades. Although the walls mainly survived, the burned-out shell rapidly decayed from a lack of maintenance. Between 1702 and 1715, Stephen's Tower disappeared completely, and the palace was beyond repair. In 1715, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles III]] ordered the demolition of the ruins. Johann H\u00f6lbling surveyed the still-existing structures. The king ordered the surviving marble statues, antiquities, inscriptions and coins should be spared (there is no evidence about the realization of the royal decree). The main part of the palace and the Broken Tower were totally demolished, the hollows and moats were filled and a new flat [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] was established. The southern fortifications, zwingers and rooms were buried under tons of rubbish and earth.\n\n===Early Baroque palace===\n[[File:Samuel Mikoviny 001.jpg|thumb|The royal castle built under King Charles III (1733)]]\nIn 1715 a small [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] palace was built according to the plans of Johann H\u00f6lbling. It was a simple rectangular building, with an inner court and a shorter side wing, which was later demolished. The H\u00f6lbling palace is identical with the core of the present-day palace, where the Baroque Court of the Budapest Historical Museum is now located.\n\nThe interior of the palace was left unfinished when work stopped in 1719. The [[Hofkriegsrat]] commissioned Fortunato di Prati to make several plans for the palace, but lack of money hindered their implementation.\n\nIn 1723 the palace was accidentally burned down and the windows were walled up in order to stop further deterioration. Several drawings from the 1730s and 1740s show the unfinished decaying shell of the simple two-storey blockhouse. Some engravings show an idealised finished version which never existed. Sometime around 1730 the roof was repaired.\n\n===Era of Maria Theresa===\n[[File:Johann Ernst Mansfeld 001.jpg|thumb|The royal castle during the reign of Maria Theresa (1777)|alt=|left]]\nIn 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich, President of the Hungarian Chamber, appealed to the public to finish the derelict palace by means of public subscription. Palatine [[J\u00e1nos P\u00e1lffy]] called upon the [[Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]] and cities to award grants for the project. The moment was favourable because relations between the Hungarian nobility and the Habsburgs were exceptionally good. The Hungarians supported Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] in the dire need of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The queen was grateful for this, and the new Royal Palace became the symbol of peace and friendship between the dynasty and the nation.\n\nThe plans of the splendid, U-shaped Baroque palace with a ''cour d'honneur'' were drawn by Jean Nicolas Jadot, chief architect of the Viennese court. After 1753 the plans were modified by his successor, Nicolaus Pacassi. Ign\u00e1c Oraschek, master builder, who guided the works, and modified the plans according to his own ideas. The foundation stone of the palace was laid on 13 May 1749, which was the Queen's birthday. The work continued at a good pace until 1758, when financial difficulties caused a seven-year break. By that time only the interiors were left unfinished.[[File:Budapest, Castle Hill, Hungary - panoramio (6).jpg|thumb|The fa\u00e7ade of the ''cour d'honneur'' constructed under Hillebrandt in the 1760s]]According to surviving historical documents, the layout of the palace followed Jadot's signed plans of 1749. The fa\u00e7ades, some interior elements and the St. Sigismund Chapel are the works of [[Nicol\u00f2 Pacassi]], while the special double [[false dome]]s were probably planned by Oraschek, formerly the master builder of Count Grassalkovich. Double false domes were typical features of the so-called Grassalkovich-type Baroque castles like [[G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151]]. However, this feature was later removed from the palace.\n\nIn 1764 the Queen visited the palace and allotted 20,000 [[thalers]] a year for the work, which recommenced in 1765 according to the plans of Franz Anton Hillebrandt. Hillebrand altered the ''cour d'honneur'' fa\u00e7ade of the central wing in [[Rococo]] style. In 1769 the St. Sigismund Chapel was consecrated and the palace was finished the same year. According to the aggregate statement of Grassalkovich, the costs were 402,679 [[forints]].\n\n===Nuns and scholars===\nThe future of the complex was uncertain; the Queen had no intention to use it as a royal residence, because she did not spend much time in Buda. In 1769 she gave one wing to the [[Sisters of Loreto]], who came from [[Sankt P\u00f6lten]]. The building was handed over on 13 May 1770, but the elegant Baroque rooms were considered unsuitable for a [[nunnery]].

The work was guided by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Farkas Kempelen]] and led to classrooms, teacher's cabinets, museums, a library and a university press being built. In the front, the false dome was removed and a four-storey observatory tower, planned by [[Alfred Hillebrandt]] or Karl Georg Zillack, was erected.\n\nIn 1778 Hillebrandt built a new chapel for [[Saint Stephen of Hungary|the first king of Hungary, Saint Stephen's]], the mummified right hand, which was recovered by Queen Maria Theresa from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] in 1771.<ref>Europe's centre around AD 1000, Volume 1, page 7, Council of Europe, Art Exhibition, Alfried Wieczorek, Hans-Martin Hinz, Theiss, 2000. {{ISBN|978-3-8062-1549-6}}</ref><ref>[[Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107]], page 54, \u017deljko Brneti\u0107, \u0160kolska knjiga, 1990. {{ISBN|978-86-03-99817-7}}</ref> The Chapel of the Holy Right was situated near the St Sigismund Chapel, in the middle of an inner court. The outer form was [[octagon]]al and the inside was oval, crowned by a dome. The altar-piece was painted by Joseph Hauzinger.\n\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony of the university was held on 25 June 1780, the 40th anniversary of the coronation of the Queen. The throne room became a splendid [[wikt:aula#Latin|aula]] decorated with frescoes depicting the four faculties. In 1953, two [[grisaille]] frescoes were discovered on the shorter sides of the room.\n\n===Residence of the Palatines===\n[[File:J\u00f3zsef n\u00e1dor Barab\u00e1s Mikl\u00f3s.jpg|thumb|Archduke Joseph Anton, [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|Palatine of Hungary]], resided in the castle.]]\nFunctional problems of the university remained unresolved, which led to the faculties being moved to [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in 1783. In 1791 the palace became the residence of the new Habsburg [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]] of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria]]. After the early death of the palatine in 1795, his younger brother [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Joseph]] succeeded him, followed by [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Stephen]]. The palatinal court in Buda Castle was the centre of fashionable life and high society in the Hungarian capital.\n\nIn 1810 the palatinal palace was damaged by fire, but in the next decades, plans were made to raise the building with an upper storey, but they were not implemented, although the observatory tower, which hindered the work, was removed. In 1838 the crypt of the St. Sigismund Chapel was rebuilt according to the plans of Franz H\u00fcppmann: the [[Palatinal Crypt]] was the burial place of Palatine Joseph and his family. The crypt is the only part of the palace that survived the Second World War.\n\nPalatine Joseph established gardens on the southern and eastern hillsides of the Castle Hill according to the plans of Antal Tost. The gardens of Buda Castle were among the most famous English-style [[landscape garden]]s in Hungary.\n\nPalatine Stephen left the palace on 23 September 1848 when a break between the liberal Hungarian government and the dynasty became inevitable.\n\nOn 5 January Buda was occupied by the Austrian army led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]]. The chief commander lodged in the royal palace.\n\nOn 4 May 1849, the Hungarian army, led by [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], [[Battle of Buda (1849)|laid siege on Buda Castle]], which was being defended by General [[Heinrich Hentzi]]. On 20 May the Hungarians captured Buda with an assault. The palace was the last stronghold of the Austrian troops, and became a site of heavy artillery fighting. The ensuing fire consumed the central and southern wings; they were completely burned out and their interiors were destroyed.\n\n===Era of Franz Joseph===\n[[File:Budai var01.jpg|thumb|Buda Castle before its remodeling in the 1880s]]\nThe palace was rebuilt between 1850 and 1856 by Josef Weiss and Carl Neuwirth. The 13-axis central wing was raised with a third storey and a squat attic-tower. The central [[risalit]] was decorated with a balcony of six colossal columns. With these changes, the former Viennese Baroque palace of Maria Theresa became considered a more austere [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical Baroque]] building.\n\nThe ballroom was redecorated with marbles and stuccoes. After 1853 stately rooms were designed in a French Rococo style, with white-gold [[stucco]]es and furniture from the [[Hofburg]]. The palace was already too small for the needs of the royal court, so the kitchens and service rooms were housed in the neighbouring [[Zeughaus, Buda|Zeughaus]]. The palace was connected with the Zeughaus by a glassed passageway.\n\nOn the western side of the ''cour d'honneur'' two smaller buildings were erected, using plans by Weiss and Neuwirth in 1854. The two-storey ''St\u00f6ckl'' housed the apartments of the archdukes and imperial officials, whereas the Wachlokal was built for the royal guards.[[File:Gyoergy Kloesz 001.jpg|thumb|View of the castle before its remodeling, as seen from the Danube|alt=|left]]Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] visited Buda Castle in 1856 and 1857. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], Franz Joseph was crowned king of Hungary. The palace played an important part in the lavish ceremony and was a symbol of peace between the dynasty and the nation.\n\nIn the last decades of the 19th century Budapest experienced rapid economic development. Ambitious [[urban planning]] projects were carried out to express the growing wealth and higher status of the Hungarian capital, with special attention being paid to the rebuilding of Buda Castle. The autonomous Hungarian government intended to create a royal palace to match any famous European royal residence (especially their old rival, [[Vienna]]'s Hofburg). The rebuilding spanned forty years, between 1875 and 1912, and caused sweeping changes in topography of the entire area.\n\nFirst the V\u00e1rkert-baz\u00e1r (Royal Garden Pavilion) was built on the embankment of the Danube, at the foot of the Castle Hill, between 1875 and 1882. This [[Neo-Renaissance]] gateway was designed by a Hungarian architect named [[Mikl\u00f3s Ybl]]. The structure was an open arcade, with pavilions, stairways and ramps, and two blocks of flats. Ybl also built a new waterworks pumping station, named V\u00e1rkert-kioszk (Royal Garden Kiosk), and two stair towers against the medieval cortina walls. The southern stair tower followed French Renaissance style, resembling a small turreted castle, while the northern stair tower was similar to a Gothic brick donjon (a fortified main tower from a castle, also called a keep). Only V\u00e1rkert-baz\u00e1r and V\u00e1rkert-kioszk survive currently.\n\n[[File:Budai var03.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Danube terrace with Eugene of Savoy's monument]]\nIn 1882 Prime Minister [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] charged Ybl with drawing a master plan for rebuilding the palace. In his 1885 plan, Ybl preserved the old Baroque palace, but mirrored it on the western side of the ''cour d'honneur'', which doubled the size of the residence. He also planned a new [[carriageway]] on the western hillside, demolishing the medieval walls and towers of the \u00dajvil\u00e1g-kert terrace. The narrowness of the natural plateau of the Castle Hill meant there was not enough space for the new Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, which Ybl solved by erecting a substructure down to the foot of the hill. The monumental western fa\u00e7ade sits on this windowless, three-storey high substructure. The whole block covered almost the entire hill, but the main fa\u00e7ade on the ''cour d'honneur'' had the same modest height as the Baroque palace. The fa\u00e7ade was clad with stone slabs, while the old parts are stuccoed; hence, the difference between the original Baroque and the Neo-Renaissance wings is obvious. The formerly open ''cour d'honneur'' became a closed court with an arched gateway, guarded by the four lions of the sculptor, [[J\u00e1nos Fadrusz]]. The court is called Lions Court (or ''Oroszl\u00e1nos udvar'').\n\n[[File:Buda Royal Castle western courtyard 1880.jpg|thumb|Royal procession in the western courtyard (1880s)]]\nThe work began on 1 May 1890, but Ybl died on 22 January 1891. His successor, [[Alajos Hauszmann]], slightly modified the plans of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing. In 1896 the building reached the level of the court, and King Franz Joseph ceremoniously laid down the foundation stone of the palace, which was soon completed.\n\nIn 1893, the 25th anniversary of King Franz Joseph's coronation was celebrated in the Royal Palace. However, the old banqueting hall proved to be too small, so Hauszmann enlarged the room by knocking down and reconstructing the wall towards the ''cour d'honneur'' (which additionally had the Hillebrandt fa\u00e7ade).\n\nIn spite of this expansion and Ybl's new wing, the palace was still deemed insufficient for great royal celebrations, so another round of construction began. The north wing, standing on the site of the old Zeughaus, was completely designed by Hauszmann. The architect doubled the Baroque palace on the Danube side, generally imitating its traditional architectural style. At the meeting point of the old and the new wings, a colonnaded portico was erected, with a lavishly-decorated [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] (with allegorical statues by K\u00e1roly Sennyey) and a flight of stairs called the ''Habsburg Stairs''. The whole palace was crowned with a dome with a copy of the [[Crown of St. Stephen]] at its apex. The dome, like other details of the north wing, shows German ''[[Jugendstil]]'' influences, as does the rear fa\u00e7ade towards the western forecourt. This forecourt also contains the [[Matthias Fountain]] (Hungarian: ''M\u00e1ty\u00e1s k\u00fatja'') by sculptor [[Alajos Str\u00f3bl]]. Above the main gate, towards Szent Gy\u00f6rgy t\u00e9r, stood a statue of the Goddess Hungaria. This side was the main fa\u00e7ade of the complex, but it was much shorter and less characteristic than the long Danube fa\u00e7ade. The old Chapel of the Holy Right was demolished to make room for a carriageway.\n\n[[File:Budai var02.jpg|thumb|The western forecourt with the facade of the Grand Ballroom|alt=|left]]\nHauszmann designed a new riding school in the former \u00dajvil\u00e1g terrace, which was now named the ''Csik\u00f3s'' court, after the Csik\u00f3s statue of Gy\u00f6rgy Vastagh (now in the western forecourt). In front of the long Danube fa\u00e7ade, an equestrian statue was erected in honour of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], the victorious leader of the Habsburg army in the [[Battle of Zenta]]. The eastern forecourt was closed off with a lavish wrought-iron rail, which ended in a pillar crowned by a statue of the legendary [[Turul]], the sacred bird of the [[Magyars]], spreading its wings above Budapest. Two flights of stairs led up to the Szent Gy\u00f6rgy t\u00e9r, which was on much higher ground.\n\nIn the western forecourt, Hauszmann designed a new neo-Baroque guardhouse and rebuilt the old Royal Stables. The Royal Gardens on the southern hillside were famous for their precious plants, glass houses and picturesque terraces. In the middle of the gardens stood the Swiss House of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Queen Elisabeth]], furnished with Hungarian folk art objects. The house was built above the ruins of the medieval gatehouse, partially making use of them.\n\nThe interior of the palace was decorated and furnished exclusively with works of the leading Hungarian artists of the age. The Royal Palace was officially inaugurated in 1912. Contemporary critics praised it as the most outstanding Hungarian building of the turn of the 20th century.\n\n===Interbellum years and World War II===\n[[File:Royal Castle Budapest 1926.JPG|thumb|View of the dome and the terrace with Prince Eugene's monument (1926)]]\nThe Hauszmann palace existed for around three decades: on 30 December 1916, the building played a part in the coronation ceremony of the last Hungarian king, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV of Hungary]]. After the 1918 revolution and the removal of the Habsburg dynasty, the Royal Palace became the seat of the new regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Horthy lived in the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing with his family between the years of 1920 and 1944. In this era the palace was the centre of Hungarian political and social life. Famous guests entertained by Horthy in the palace included King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] in 1937 and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) in 1938.[[File:Budav\u00e1ri Palota 10x15.jpg|thumb|The Royal Palace in the 1930s|alt=|left]]On 16 October 1944 a Nazi German commando unit, led by [[Otto Skorzeny]], occupied the Royal Palace and forced the regent to abdicate. Buda Castle was the last major stronghold of Budapest held by [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis forces]] during the [[Battle of Budapest|siege of Budapest]] between 29 December 1944 and 13 February 1945. The German and Hungarian forces defending the castle attempted to break the Soviet blockade on 11 February 1945, but failed. Allegedly the Soviet Red Army knew about their plans and had aimed heavy weapons at the possible escape routes hours earlier. This is considered one of the biggest disasters of Hungarian military history.\n\nHeavy fights and artillery fire rendered the palace into ruins. The furniture vanished, roofs and vaults collapsed and the southern and western wings were burned out. The destruction was comparable to that of the great siege of 1686.\n\n===Reconstruction===\nImmediately after the war, archeological research was begun in order to unearth the remains of the [[Medieval Royal Palace (Buda Castle)|medieval castle]]. The research, led by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ger\u0151 (1946\u20131966) and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Zolnay (1967\u20131979), was likely the biggest castle excavation in Europe. The former Royal Gardens stairways, pavilions and glass houses, which dated from the turn of the 20th century, had to be sacrificed. Important parts of the former Sigismund and Matthias Palace had survived under the thick earth fill.\n\n[[File:Lanc hid - Budapest 3 Febr 1946 Foto Takkk Hungary.jpg|thumb|The burned-out ruins of the Royal Palace and the Chain Bridge (1946)]]\nThe first reconstruction plan of the medieval remains was written by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ger\u0151 in 1950 and finalised in 1952. The reconstruction work was finished in 1966. Contrary to the generally accepted principles of historic reconstruction, the medieval fortification system was rebuilt in its entirety. Important elements like the 16th century Great Rondella and the medieval Gatehouse, the Mace Tower, the walls and the zwingers were reconstructed according to the results of the archaeological research and contemporary pictorial evidence. The low-lying southern wing of the Gothic palace was also reconstructed, together with the vaulted Gothic Hall and the Lower Church of the former Royal Chapel. Medieval-style gardens were planted in the zwingers. The foundation of the Stephen's Tower was unearthed, but as archaeological evidence was lacking, the tower was not reconstructed. The remains of the Broken Tower were covered again.\n\nThe large-scale reconstruction of the medieval fortifications substantially changed the cityscape of Budapest. At the time it was considered a highly successful project, reconciling historical authenticity with urban-planning demands.\n\nIn the 1970s, archeological research continued on the northern and western side of the palace, led by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Zolnay. It produced many important achievements, including the Late Gothic Buda Castle Statues. The Karakash Pasha Tower, in the ''\u00dajvil\u00e1g Garden'', was a Turkish-era tower demolished at the end of the 19th century. Photographic evidence enabled its reconstruction, but the new tower was only a copy of the original, and the details are not considered authentic.\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Buda Castle 2365941876 12a03f263c.jpg|thumb|The modernist dome designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961. Vast amounts of art work and sculpture on the exterior and almost all of the interior that survived the war were intentionally destroyed during the postwar reconstruction.]]\nThe government made a decision about reconstruction only in 1948. According to contemporary photos, all the important interiors were in a damaged state, but their reconstruction was technically possible. The new communist government of Hungary considered the Royal Palace a symbol of the former regime. Therefore, Hungarian leaders chose to thoroughly modernise the interior and exterior of the palace. Architectural trends played a part in the decision, as modernist architects had condemned the Hauszmann style as \"too ornate\".\n\nThe first modernist reconstruction plan was made by architect Istv\u00e1n Jan\u00e1ky in 1950. His controversial concept was later modified. In 1952 the Hungarian government asked for help from Poland, because they had successfully rebuilt [[Warsaw]] and, indeed, other cities. A delegation of Polish experts, led by the architectural historian [[Jan Zachwatowicz]], proposed the rebuilding of the Hauszmann palace.[[File:Buda--Castles01.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the castle today|alt=|left]]During the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the remaining interior, including the rooms and halls that were undamaged, were destroyed. Important exterior details, such as the main entrance, the Habsburg Steps, the dome, the Royal Stables, the guardhouse and the riding school were demolished, and the remaining fa\u00e7ades were simplified. In Lions Court the ornate gates of ''King's Stairs'' and ''Diplomat's Stairs'' were demolished. The doorway of the castle church disappeared, as did the chapel. The detailed Neo-Baroque roofs were simplified and plain new windows were installed. The allegorical sculpture group of the tympanum was destroyed.\n\nAt the same time however, medieval elements that were uncovered were reconstructed in what was thought their appearance was. No precise drawings existed of the medieval elements, therefore an approximate reconstruction of their appearance was done.\n\nThe modernist dome was designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961 after Italian Baroque models. The palace was rebuilt by 1966, but the interior spaces were ready only in the 1980s. Buda Castle became a cultural centre, home to three museums and the [[National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library]].\n\n===21st century===\nIn March 2006 the National Office of Cultural Heritage finalised the long-term development plan of Buda Castle. Asserting that the modernisation in 1952\u201366 caused irreversible damage, they proposed the partial reconstruction of the fa\u00e7ades, including the dome and the Habsburg Steps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nol.hu/archivum/archiv-390037?ref=sso|title=N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g \u2013 Pap\u00edron sz\u00e9p a V\u00e1r j\u00f6v\u0151je|work=nol.hu|accessdate=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113092114/http://nol.hu/archivum/archiv-390037?ref=sso|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> No decision has been reached about the realization of the development plan.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] chose the medieval King's Cellar in Buda Castle as the place to announce the list of the \"most important public works projects\", which was financed by [[European Union]] funds between 2007 and 2013.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfu.hu/a_kormany_dontott_az_uj_magyarorszag_fejlesztesi_terv_akcioterveirol |title=Nemzeti Fejleszt\u00e9si \u00dcgyn\u00f6ks\u00e9g |publisher=Nfu.hu |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206091241/http://www.nfu.hu/a_kormany_dontott_az_uj_magyarorszag_fejlesztesi_terv_akcioterveirol |archivedate=6 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 an international consortium began to build an underground garage for 700 cars under the former Csik\u00f3s Court.

Only the ground and first floors were reconstructed; the castle was originally much higher. The unfinished fa\u00e7ade stops at the level of the Baroque terrace above, with two windows opening towards the southern court and another two opening towards the eastern court. The four almost-identical windows are square, four-panel stone constructions of very fine Gothic craftsmanship, with their outer frames decorated with small columns. One window, which had been walled up, was discovered ''in situ'' during archeological research, and the others were reconstructed from fragments by the sculptor Ern\u0151 Szak\u00e1l by means of [[anastylosis]]. The ground floor openings are simpler. An arched stone doorway gives access to the southern court from the cellar under the Gothic Hall.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade was originally plastered. The whitewashed surface was decorated with a painted pattern in a rusty hue, resembling [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. Fragments of painted geometrical decoration, a common feature on the medieval buildings of Buda, were discovered on the eastern fa\u00e7ade, but it was not restored.\n\nA Gothic balcony tower projects from the wall at the end of the eastern fa\u00e7ade. Its reconstruction was a much debated issue, because the balcony tower goes above the level of the Baroque terrace, disturbing the harmonious panorama of the palace. On the other hand, it clearly indicates that there are higher, missing floors.\n\nThe balcony tower is a two-storey structure standing on a wide stone basement. The first floor is a solid stone wall without any openings and the niche behind it belongs to the Gothic Hall. The second floor has a balcony with three windows; it is now closed off by a glass wall. Originally it would have been part of an important ceremonial room. The balcony is in the shape of half an octagon. The three Gothic double lancet windows are considered the most important architectural elements of the tower and the profiles; frames and mullions were restored in a simplified form, using many of the original stones. The tower is covered with a flat metal roof.\n\nThe Gothic Hall is connected to Stephen's Castle (''Istv\u00e1n v\u00e1r'') on the western side. It was named after Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, the younger brother of King Louis I of Hungary. Built in the 1340s\u20131370s, it is the oldest part of the medieval royal palace. Only the foundation and three interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms survive.\n\nStephen's Tower (''Istv\u00e1n torony'') was the keep of Stephen's Castle. However, it was destroyed by an explosion in 1686. The ground floor walls were discovered a little time after 1946. It was a square building (11.7 \u00d7 11.1 m), built upon the rock surface of Castle Hill. The walls are 2.31 to 2.7 m thick with narrow [[arrowslit]]s on the southern, western and northern sides. The original doorway, on the eastern side, was walled up after the Gothic Hall was built in the 15th century.\n\nStephen's Tower was originally a free-standing structure, sited differently from later buildings. The triangle in front of it was walled up to create a continuous southern fa\u00e7ade for the palace. During post-war reconstruction, this part of the fa\u00e7ade (with a broken stone doorway) was not reconstructed. A vaulted room (6.2 \u00d7 6.3 m) on the ground floor was still intact in 1820, according to a contemporary drawing. Although the ribs, [[corbel]]s and [[key stone]] were discovered during archeological research, the room was not reconstructed. A spiral stairway had connected the room with the missing higher floors.\n\nThe remaining part of the Stephen's Castle (with the barrel-vaulted rooms behind) has a simple stone fa\u00e7ade with a Gothic doorway. The pointed arch was later restored.\n\n==Interior==\nThe interior from the time of Maria Theresa and Franz Joseph was mostly destroyed during World War II and the post-war reconstruction, excluding the Palatinal Crypt, which survived both. Little information exists about the interiors from the medieval and Baroque eras, but the palace built at the turn of the 20th century was meticulously recorded, using detailed descriptions, photographic documentation and grounds plans. Architect Alajos Hauszmann said about the royal apartments: \"I created a {{convert|200|m|ft|-1|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} long series of rooms, longer than any similar royal apartments in continental Europe except [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].\"\n\nA series of rooms from the medieval castle were unearthed and reconstructed during the post-war rebuilding of Buda Castle in 1958\u201362. They are now part of the permanent exhibition of the Budapest History Museum in \"Building E\" of Buda Castle.\n\n===Medieval period===\n\n====Architectural context====\nOnly a fragment of the medieval castle survived the destruction of 1686\u20131715. The surviving rooms are not considered the most important ones; and none of the more famous rooms and buildings mentioned in the medieval sources exist today. The rooms which were unearthed after 1946 were only saved by chance and by their geographical position at a lower level than the newly created Baroque terrace. The Gothic Hall and the Palace Chapel were built by King Sigismund Luxemburg at the beginning of the 15th century. The castle wing is surrounded by a complex system of medieval fortifications.\n\n====Castle chapel====\n[[File:Buda castle interior church.JPG|thumb|The lower chapel of the medieval castle]]\nThe first chapel in the castle was probably built in the 14th century during the reign of Louis I of Hungary. Eberhard Windecke claimed in his Chronicle that [[Charles II of Hungary]] was murdered in 1386 in a room from which the royal chapel could be seen. The chapel was again mentioned in the Chronicle of [[Lorenzo de Monacis]], which was written around 1390.\n\nKing Sigismund of Luxemburg thoroughly rebuilt the old Anjou castle during the first decades of the 15th century. He erected a Gothic church in place of the former chapel. The Anjou castle's fa\u00e7ade was now facing towards the inner palace courtyard, and the long chancel was projecting from the eastern side of the palace. The [[chancel]] was built upon a lower church due to a lack of space on the narrow plateau. The church had a {{convert|21|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|0}} nave and an {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|0}} chancel. The [[flamboyant]] Royal Church of Buda Castle was similar to the more famous [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.\n\nArcheological research proved the date of the church, because 15th-century strata were discovered under the intact brick floor of the lower church.<ref>L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Zolnay: A budai v\u00e1r, Bp: 1981, p. 60</ref>\n\nIn November 1489, Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the Ottoman Empire sent the relics of [[John the Merciful|John the Almoner]] to King Matthias Corvinus. The King placed the relics in the Royal Chapel, which was re-dedicated and embellished with Renaissance furniture. In 1526, Buda was plundered by the Ottoman Turks after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. The relics were rescued in time and carried to [[Pressburg]], where they are still kept currently. A surviving church inventory from 1530 shows a wealth of furnishings. Later, King [[J\u00e1nos Szapolyai]] converted the lower church into a bastion. The large Gothic windows were walled up; and only the rectangular arrow slits were left open.\n\nIn 1541 the Ottoman Turks captured Buda without resistance, and the Royal Church ceased to be a place of Christian worship. The upper church was destroyed in the 1686 siege of Buda, and the ruins were demolished in 1715. The vault of the lower church collapsed, and the interior was filled with rubbish. The remains were then buried under the new Baroque terrace for two centuries.\n\nThe ruins of the lower church were discovered by archeologists in 1949\u201350. The remains were buried in 1953 because of conceptional disputes about the possible reconstruction. The chapel, finally reconstructed by 1963, was re-consecrated in 1990.\n\n====Gothic Hall====\nThe Gothic Hall is one of the most important surviving examples of secular Gothic architecture in Central Europe. It was built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg in the early 15th century as an extension of the earlier [[Anjou]] palace. It was built on the southern edge of the natural rock plateau of Castle Hill. The level difference between the plateau and the southern court was about {{convert|2.79|m|ft|1}}. A vaulted cellar was built under the hall to span this difference.\n\nThe Gothic Hall is an irregular rectangle of {{convert |20.2|xx|11.55|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a closed niche on the eastern side, which is the inside of the balcony tower. It is divided into two naves with Gothic [[rib vault]]s. The vaults are supported by two massive pillars which come up through the floor from the cellar beneath the room, and in addition, half-pillars in the corners support the ribs. All six vaults are quadripartite, and the two on the inner side are irregularly shaped.\n\nThe hall has four windows, two on the southern side and two on the eastern side, with stone benches in the window niches. The Hall was connected to the palace through a door in the northern wall, supposedly on the place of the original doorway. The northern section of the floor is three steps higher.\n\n[[File:Schedel chapel.JPG|thumb|Buda Castle in the [[Middle Ages]], from the Chronicles of [[Hartmann Schedel]]. The castle church, dedicated to St. John the Almoner, is indicated by the blue rectangle.]]All the newly built side walls were plastered and painted white, while the original stone surfaces were left uncovered. The ribs, pillars, arches and window niches were restored by sculptor Ern\u0151 Szak\u00e1l in 1961\u201362. The ribs have a simple profile, but fragments of a more complicated type were also found in the rubble, together with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s. These pieces supposedly belonged to another stately hall situated above the room, but they were built into the reconstructed vaults by restorers in the 20th-century.\n\nThe northern pillar of the Gothic Hall was already discovered by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century. The remains were buried under the outbuildings of the Royal Gardens, and Hauszmann protected the medieval pillar by building a brick shaft around it.\n\n====Barrel-vaulted rooms====\nThree interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms belong to the oldest part of the palace, Stephen's Castle, which was built by Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, in the 14th century. The northern room is larger ({{convert|6.62|xx|9.42|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) than the southern ones ({{convert|5|xx|4.55|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The northern room is covered by an east-west axial vault while the southern rooms have north-south axial vaults.\n\nThe southern room is connected to the inner courtyard by a doorway. There is a small window high on the western wall. The middle room has a similar window. The larger northern room has three slit windows, one facing west and two facing north, all had iron rails. The rooms were connected to each other with carved Gothic corbel doors. The walls were originally plastered. In the southern room, a medieval stairway led to a [[trapdoor]] and a medieval toilet hidden in the empty space between the walls of the castle and the keep.\n\nThe barrel vaulted rooms were supposedly used as a prison in the Middle Ages. Later the southern vaults collapsed. The intact barrel vault of the northern room was broken by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century when he filled the cellar with rubble. The barrel-vaulted rooms were restored in 1958\u20131962.\n\n====Albrecht Cellar====\nA medieval cellar north of the barrel-vaulted rooms, later called ''Albrecht pince'' (Albrecht Cellar), is covered with a Gothic brick barrel vault. The walls are blackened from burning. The cellar was probably built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg as the ''Cisterna Regia'', i.e. the great underground [[cistern]] of the palace.\n\nThe Cisterna Regia was situated under the former northern zwinger of the palace. This small rectangular courtyard became a private royal garden during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The private garden was an early Renaissance ''giardino segreto'' (hidden garden). It was designed by architect [[Chimenti Camicia]] in the 1470s. A well in the middle of the garden was fed by the cistern underneath.\n\nThe hidden garden, the well and the cistern survived the 1686 siege of Buda. They were indicated on the plans of the area drawn by military architect Joseph de Ha\u00fcy in 1687. In 1715\u20131724 the former Cisterna Regia became the cellar of the new Baroque palace. A section of this room was later used as an ice chamber.\n\n====King's Cellar====\nThe King's Cellar (''Kir\u00e1ly pince'') is not a medieval structure, but a Baroque-era brick cellar under the Danube side of Building E. It was filled with tons of earth and rubble, and the original eastern fa\u00e7ade of the medieval royal palace survived under the fill. The inner walls of the Baroque palace were actually built upon the old fa\u00e7ade. Only the {{convert|7|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|0}} basement section of the original fa\u00e7ade remained.\n\nThis wing was built by King Sigismund of Luxenburg in the early 15th century and was rebuilt by King Matthias Corvinus 50 years later. The surviving eastern fa\u00e7ade was built from large, finely carved blocks of stone. It followed the contour of Castle Hill with a break in the middle. A [[buttress]] was added and a rectangular tower with two buttresses on its corners. The lower part of a balcony on the tower was reconstructed, with three elegant Gothic corbels decorated with cusps.\n\nIt was not possible to demolish the King's Cellar because the whole Baroque palace was resting upon it; the inner fill was removed in 1961. The medieval fa\u00e7ade was reconstructed inside the cellar space between 1961 and 1965. Large windows were cut in the outer wall of the cellar to let in the daylight. Currently, the architectural history of the palace is discernible by viewing the interwoven layers of the past.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny chose the King's Cellar as the place to announce the list of the \"most important public works projects\", financed by European Union funds between 2007 and 2013.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n=== Baroque and Historicism ===\n\n==== Old ceremonial rooms ====\nThe old ceremonial rooms were as follows:\n\n===== \"Zenta\" Room =====\n[[File:Zenta Eloterem.png|thumb|The Zenta Room]]\nThe \"Zenta\" Room (''\"Zenta\" el\u0151terem'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the audience antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the central wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the large painting of the Battle of Zenta contained therein.\n\n===== Audience Antechamber =====\n[[File:Fogadasi Varoterem.png|thumb|left|The Audience Antechamber]]\nThe Audience Antechamber (''Fogad\u00e1si v\u00e1r\u00f3terem'') was situated north of the ballroom on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Antichambre Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin'' (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Antechamber\"). The room gave access to Maria Theresa's private apartments from the ballroom. In the early 1900s, the audience antechamber became part of the ceremonial apartments and had the same white-golden Rococo stucco decoration as the white antechamber on the other side.\n\n===== Grand Throne Room =====\n[[File:Buda Castle nagyterem-mj.jpg|thumb|The Grand Throne Room (c. 1894)]]\nThe Grand Throne Room (''Nagy tr\u00f3nterem''), formerly known as the ballroom (''Nagyterem''), on the first floor of the Baroque wing had several layers of Baroque decoration from the second half of the 18th and the 19th century. Two surviving drawings record the oldest form of the room. Jakob Schmutzer's drawing from 1777 shows the opening ceremony of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University after it was moved to the palace. The room had a Late Baroque decoration with double grooved [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster]]s between the windows and stucco garlands. The walls were decorated with [[Vinzenz Fischer]]'s frescoes of the four faculties. J\u00f3zsef Pollencig's drawing from 1795 shows a ball scene in the \"Prunksaal\". The pilasters were kept, but the frescoes were already covered, and the whole room was stuccoed. On the vault the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary can be seen. After the destruction of the 1849 siege, the room was redecorated in Neo-Baroque style. In 1892 the old ballroom was rebuilt with a new ceiling and a gallery towards the Lions Court; three of its side walls were preserved. It was enlarged again after 1896. The function of the ballroom was given to another new hall and this room was converted into the main throne hall instead. In the early 1900s, the room had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with three large chandeliers.\n\nVinzenz Fischer's frescoes were re-discovered in 1953 during the post-war reconstruction. In spite of this, all the decoration layers were destroyed. Today it houses the Gothic altar collection of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]].\n\n===== White Antechamber =====\n[[File:Feher Eloterem.png|thumb|left|The White Antechamber]]\nThe White Antechamber (''Feh\u00e9r el\u0151terem'') is on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated south of the throne room. In the Baroque era it was called ''Zweytes Antichambre'' (\"second antechamber\"). In the early 1900s it had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a white Rococo stove.\n\n===== \"Coronation\" Room =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Koronazas Eloterem.png|thumb|The Coronation Room]]\nThe \"Coronation\" Room (''\"Koron\u00e1z\u00e1s\" el\u0151terem''), also on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the white antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the southern wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the painting of Franz Joseph I's coronation as [[King of Hungary]] after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\n==== Old royal apartments ====\nThe old royal apartments are as follows:\n\n===== Small Throne Room =====\n[[File:Kis Tronterem.jpg|thumb|left|The Small Throne Room]]\nThe Small Throne Room (''Kis tr\u00f3nterem''), which was situated next to the Audience Antechamber on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Audienz-Zimmer'' and was part of the Empress' private apartments. In Hauszmann's time it was converted into the throne room of the palace, with a simple Baroque throne under a [[baldachin]]. It had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo [[cocklestove]].\n\n===== \"Circle\" Tearoom =====\n[[File:Circle Teaszalon.png|thumb|The \"Circle\" Tearoom]]\nThe \"Circle\" Tearoom (''\"Circle\" teaszalon'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and situated next to the small throne room, in the corner of the southern wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Gesellschaft Zimmer Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin'' (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Parlour\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo [[cocklestove]]. The furniture consisted of a Rococo parlour suite.\n\n===== Antechamber =====\n[[File:Eloszoba 25.png|thumb|left|Antechamber, former dressing room of the Queen]]\nThe Antechamber was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated next to the \"circle\" tearoom with two windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called ''Ankleide-Zimmer Ihrer Majest\u00e4t der Kaiserin'' (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Dressing Room\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. It was connected to another small room, the ''Frauen Kammer''. In Hauszmann's time the walls were largely clad with wallpaper. The furniture consisted of a Rococo [[cocklestove]], chairs and paintings. The last small room of the Empress, the former ''Schreib cabinet'' (\"writing room\"), with one window opening on to the Danube, later became a simple passageway.\n\n===== Smoking Room =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Dohanyzo Szalon.png|thumb|The Smoking Salon, former bedchamber of Queen Maria Theresa]]\nThe Smoking Room (''Doh\u00e1nyz\u00f3 szalon'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated in the middle of the Danube side of the old palace. In the Baroque era it was called ''Schlafzimmer Ihrer k.k. Majest\u00e4ten'' (\"The Imperial Couple's Bedroom\"). It was the only common room of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I. In the early 1900s, the walls were largely hung with wallpaper. The furniture consisted of a Rococo parlour suite and paintings. In the old imperial apartments only the ceilings had the typically white-golden stucco decoration, used in the old ceremonial apartments.\n\n===== Writing Room =====\n[[File:Iroszoba.png|thumb|left|The Writing Room]]\nThe Writing Room (''\u00cdr\u00f3szoba'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was formerly part of the private apartments of Francis I. One window opened to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called ''Ankleidecabinet S.M. des Kaisers'' (\"Emperor's Dressing Room\"). It was connected to another small room, the second dressing room. Later, the imperial dressing room was divided with a wall; with half being converted into a simple passageway, the other into a small writing room. In the early 1900s the latter's walls were largely clad with a very ornate Rococo wallpaper. It had a white marble mantelpiece with a large Rococo mirror above.\n\n===== Parlour =====\n[[File:Tarsalkodo Terem.png|thumb|The Parlour]]\nThe Parlour (''T\u00e1rsalkod\u00f3 terem''), on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was part of the private apartments of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]. It was situated in the corner of the southern wing with 2+3 windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era the room was divided with a wall, one half named ''Empfangs Zimmer S.M. des Kaisers'' (\"Imperial Audience Room\"), the other ''Arbeits Cabinet'' (\"Study\"). In Hauszmann's time, it was converted to a great parlour with wallpaper clad walls, a Rococo cocklestove, a chandelier, paintings, chairs and a mirror.\n\n===== Antechamber =====\n[[File:Eloszoba 29.png|thumb|left|last Antechamber]]\nThe Antechamber, on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was the last room of the former private apartments of Francis I. In the Baroque era it was called ''Zweytes Audienz Zimmer'' (\"second audience room\"). In Hauszmann's time the walls were mainly clad with wallpaper, and it had a Rococo cocklestove, a chandelier, paintings and chairs.\n\n====South Wing====\nThe rooms of the south wing are as follows:\n\n===== Baroque Court =====\nThe Baroque Court (''Barokk udvar''), a rectangular court, which is the oldest part of the Baroque palace. Here the original 18\u201319th century fa\u00e7ades survived, and in 1997 the court was covered with a glass roof and became the main exhibition hall of the Budapest History Museum.\n\n===== King's Staircase =====\n[[File:Kir\u00e1lyl\u00e9pcs\u0151 bej\u00e1rata.png|thumb|upright|Entrance to the King's Staircase]]\nThe King's Staircase (''Kir\u00e1ly-l\u00e9pcs\u0151''), the Baroque main staircase of the southern wing gave access to the private apartments of Emperor Francis I. Both the King's Staircase and its northern twin, the Diplomat's Staircase, had ornate gates opening onto Lions Court, decorated with [[telamon]]s. The kitchens were originally situated on the ground floor of the southern wing, but they were relocated by Hauszmann.\n\n==== Central Wing ====\nThe central wing had the following rooms:\n\n===== Diplomat's Staircase =====\nThe Diplomat's Staircase (''Diplomata-l\u00e9pcs\u0151'') was the Baroque main staircase of the central (originally northern) wing and gave access to the private apartments of Maria Theresa. In the 18th century there was an officer's dining room and a smaller kitchen on the ground floor and another dining room with a cafe kitchen on the first floor. The southern and northern (later central) wings had the same ground plan: all the rooms opened from a passageway running along the sides of a rectangular central court. The two monumental stairways were rebuilt by Hauszmann in Neo-Baroque style.\n\n===== St Stephen's Chapel =====\n[[File:Kapolna Buda varpalota.jpg|thumb|upright|St Stephen's Chapel|alt=|left]]\nSt Stephen's Chapel, known before as St. Sigismund Chapel, or Castle Church (''Szent Zsigmond-k\u00e1polna'', ''V\u00e1rtemplom'') was the [[chapel royal]] in the western end of this wing, which had no fa\u00e7ades, only a door opening onto Lions Court (through an antechamber). Construction was finished in 1768 and the church was consecrated in 1769. The ground plan was drawn by Nicolaus Pacassi, with the interior was designed by his follower, Franz Anton Hillebrandt. The ground plan followed a typical \"violin\" form favoured in the Baroque church architecture of Central Europe at that time. It had a rectangular chancel and a nave with four bays for side altars. On the first and the second floors two oratories opened into the chancel and a two-storey high gallery was situated above the entrance. In 1777\u201378 a new door was opened in the first side bay to give access to the new chapel of the Holy Right. An engraving from 1771 to 1780 shows the original interior design in its completed form: double pilasters, windows with segmental arches, stucco and false marble decoration, double oratory windows and a doorway with a stucco veil drawn aside by flying [[Putto|putti]]. The church was slightly rebuilt by Hauszmann, who demolished the Chapel of the Holy Right in 1899 and built a new chapel for the relic behind the chancel (converting a small recess). This chapel was decorated with the golden Venetian mosaics of [[K\u00e1roly Lotz]]. A new Neo-Baroque main altar was built in the church in 1899.\n\n20th-century photos testify that the church survived in its Baroque form until the war. During a siege, the vaults of the church partially collapsed and the furniture was plundered. The Castle Church was left decaying for more than a decade. In 1957 the remaining two vaults collapsed, and the church was totally destroyed and converted to exhibition spaces. The altar table was rescued and re-erected in [[Pilisv\u00f6r\u00f6sv\u00e1r]] in 1957. The Lotz mosaics from the Chapel of the Holy Right were also rescued and re-assembled in [[Balatonalm\u00e1di]].\n\n===== Palatinal Crypt =====\n[[File:Jozsefnador palatin Hungary tombstone.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary]] in the Palatinal Crypt]]\nThe [[Palatinal Crypt]] (''N\u00e1dori kripta'') was under the former palace chapel and is the only surviving room of the whole Royal Castle. The underground crypt was first used as a burial place between 1770 and 1777. In August 1820, Elisabeth Karoline, Palatine Joseph's infant daughter was buried in the crypt. Seventeen years later, the Palatine's 13-year-old son Alexander Leopold followed. Palatine Joseph decided to convert the crypt into a family mausoleum and commissioned Franz H\u00fcppmann with the task. The work was finished in 1838, and other members of the Palatine's family were reburied here. Palatine Joseph himself was interred on 13 January 1847. The crypt was continuously used by the Hungarian branch of the Habsburg family. It was repeatedly restored and enriched with new works of art, frescoes, statues and ornate stone sarcophagi, made by renowned artists of the 19th century. The last member of the family buried there was Archduchess Klotild in 1927. The crypt survived the war unscathed and was spared during the post-war reconstruction.\n\nThe crypt was looted in 1966 and 1973 (during the construction works), when some corpses were thrown out of the sarcophagi by the thieves. The human remains were later identified and reburied. The crypt was restored in 1985\u20131987. Since then the Palatinal Crypt is part of the exhibition of the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\n====North Wing====\n\n===== Lobby =====\nThe main lobby (''El\u0151csarnok'') of the Royal Palace was situated in Hauszmann's Northern Wing On the Danube side. It was a long, rectangular hall divided into four sections with free standing [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and two square pillars. The section at the southern end was elevated a few steps. Nine arched windows opened towards the Danube. In the middle of the other sidewall, a doorway led to the inner courtyard. The walls and the ceiling were stuccoed. The southern elevation was closed off with a stone balustrade between the pillars and the wall. The ornate lobby was designed for important state ceremonies.\n\n===== Grand Ballroom =====\n[[File:Nagy Balterem.png|thumb|left|The Grand Ballroom]]\nThe Grand Ballroom (''Nagy b\u00e1lterem''), in the middle part of the northern wing, took over the function of the smaller old ballroom in the Baroque wing. Designed by Hauszmann, it was the most splendid room of the palace. The two-storey high, airy room was lavishly decorated with stuccoes, half columns, trabeation, balconies and six crystal chandeliers in Neo-Baroque style. Seven arched windows and doorways opened towards a pillared terrace facing the western forecourt. On the other side, the ballroom was connected to the Buffet Hall through three doors.\n\nPhotos made after the war show the room with its vaulted ceiling collapsed. The ballroom was not restored but totally destroyed in the course of the post-war remodelling.\n\n===== Dining Hall =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Buffet Csarnok.png|thumb|The Dining Hall]]\nThe Dining Hall (''Buffet-csarnok''), on the Danube side of the northern wing, was a very long hall used for state banquets. It was connected to the Great Ballroom nearby and it was possible to join them together. There was a shorter, passage-like space between the two rooms. This passage was separated from the Buffet Hall by six square pillars, while its other side was a solid wall with three doors. On the eastern side of the Buffet Hall a long row of windows opened towards the Danube and a pillared terrace. The Buffet Hall was divided into three sections with free-standing Ionic columns, holding trabeations. The vaulted ceiling was lavishly decorated with frescoes and stuccoes.\n\n===== Habsburg Hall =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kir\u00e1lyi Palota, Habsburg Nagyterem.png|thumb|left|The Habsburg Hall]]\nThe Habsburg Hall (''Habsburg terem'') was situated in the middle of the long palace complex, under Hauszmann's (false) dome, where the new northern wing and the old palace met. Although this part of the building belonged to the original palace, it was thoroughly rebuilt by Hauszmann\u2013this stately room was totally his own work. It was one of the three historical rooms of the palace representing the important periods of Hungarian history. A free-standing, double flight of steps, called the Habsburg Steps, connected the room with the Royal Gardens on the Danube terrace. The room had lavish Baroque decorations with half-pillars and gilded stuccoes. The vaulted ceiling was decorated with K\u00e1roly Lotz's fresco ''Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty''. K\u00e1roly Senyei's four [[Carrara marble]] busts stood in front of the sidewalls representing King Charles III, Queen Maria Theresa, King Franz Joseph and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Queen Elisabeth]].\n\nThe Habsburg Hall survived World War II relatively undamaged, but in the 1950s it was demolished for political reasons.\n\n====Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing====\n[[File:Budapest, Budav\u00e1ri Palota.jpg|thumb|Wing facing the district of Krisztinav\u00e1ros]]\nThe Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing faces the district of [[Krisztinav\u00e1ros]], which was named in honour of the daughter of Queen Maria Theresa, Archduchess [[Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen]].\n\n===== Entrance hall =====\nThe entrance hall (''El\u0151csarnok'') opened from Lions Court, under an arcaded Neo-Renaissance portico, through ornate wrought-iron doors. This now serves as the entrance of the [[Hungarian National Library]]. The hall was a long, oblong-shaped room with 4+4 free standing Ionic columns in front of the walls on the longer sides, holding a trabeation. In the end of the shorter sides two doors opened into antechambers. The three arcaded doorways on the longer side opened into a lobby. The ceiling of the hallway was stuccoed, and the whole design was Italian Renaissance in style.\n\n===== Lobby =====\n[[File:Lepcsohaz.jpg|thumb|The Grand Staircase]]\nThe lobby (''El\u0151csarnok'') was connected to the hall of the main staircase through pillars. The stuccoed ceiling was held up by two rectangular pillars. The apartments of Archduke J\u00f3zsef \u00c1gost and his wife, Archduchess Auguszta, were situated on the ground floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing and opened from this room. Now it serves as the lobby of the Hungarian National Library in a radically modernised form.\n\n===== Main Staircase =====\nThe monumental main staircase (''F\u0151l\u00e9pcs\u0151h\u00e1z''), with three flights, led up from the lobby to the first floor in an airy, glass-roofed hall. The side walls of the hall were decorated in Italian Renaissance style with colossal Corinthian half-columns, stuccoes and lunette openings. Ornate wrought-iron chandeliers and intricate balustrades decorated the stairs. On the ground floor, colossal [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlas statues]] stood beside the side pillars, holding the weight of the upper flights. The marble statues were the works of J\u00e1nos Fadrusz from 1897. During the post-war reconstruction the main staircase was radically modernised. Only the two colossal Atlas statues survived. Now they are standing somewhat incongruently near their original places.\n\n===== St Stephen's Room =====\n[[File:Szent Istvan Terem.png|thumb|left|St Stephen's Room]]\nSt Stephen's Room (''\"Szent Istv\u00e1n\" terem''), on the first floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, was one of the \"historical rooms\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. Together with the Matthias Room and the Habsburg Room, they represented the three most important periods of [[History of Hungary|Hungarian history]]. Saint Stephen's Room connected the new Private Royal Apartments and\u2014through a very long passageway\u2014the Old Royal Apartments in the Danube Wing. Its style evoked the age of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1ds]], the first Hungarian dynasty in the early Middle Ages. The walls were clad with dark carved wood paneling. The most spectacular item was a large stone mantelpiece with [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] architectural details and the bust of King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]], the first king of Hungary. The room was furnished with medieval-looking metal chandeliers and heavy wooden furniture.\n\n===== Matthias Room =====\n[[File:Matyas Terem 1903.jpg|thumb|Matthias Room]]\nMatthias Room (''M\u00e1ty\u00e1s terem'') was named after King [[Matthias Corvinus]], who ruled in the late Middle Ages. It was one of the three \"historical rooms\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. The room opened from the Royal Bedroom, at the end of the line of private apartments. It had three windows opening towards the hills of Buda. There was a long terrace in front of the room. The style of the Matthias Room was [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], with carved wooden paneling and a coffered ceiling. It was furnished with a mantelpiece in the corner and two chandeliers, the most spectacular item being the equestrian statue of King Matthias, sculpted by J\u00e1nos Fadrusz. The statue was a miniature copy of the original standing on the main square of [[Kolozsv\u00e1r]] (now Cluj-Napoca). This copy was saved after the war and put on display in the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\n===== Strong Room =====\n[[File:Kir\u00e1lyi Palota b\u00e1lterme, a k\u00f6zszeml\u00e9re helyezett Szent Korona \u00e9s a koron\u00e1z\u00e1si \u00e9kszerek. Fortepan 23009.jpg|thumb|Hungarian Crown Jewels on display at the Strong Room]]\nThe Hungarian crown jewels were kept in the specially-designed Strong Room (''P\u00e1nc\u00e9lterem'') on the second floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing. The [[Crown of Saint Stephen]] was kept here between 1900 and 1944.\n\n===== Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum =====\nThe small Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum (''Erzs\u00e9bet Kir\u00e1lyn\u00e9 Eml\u00e9km\u00fazeum'') on the second floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing was established in remembrance of Queen Elisabeth after her murder in 1898. Memorabilia were collected by Ida Ferenczy, Elisabeth's former [[lady-in-waiting]], Viscountess Pallavicini and Countess Ilona Batthy\u00e1ny. The museum opened on 15 January 1908 as an affiliate of the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. The collection contained personal items, letters and clothes. Its most important relic was the costume that Elisabeth had been wearing when she was murdered. One room was meticulously recreated as the Queen's own writing room with her original writing desk and her 219 Hungarian books. The museum was badly damaged during World War II,<ref name=\"UNESCO\">\"Budapest including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle\", UNESCO.hu, 2010.</ref> and the surviving relics were bestowed to other museums.\n\n====Private royal apartments====\n\n===== Royal Entrance Hall =====\n[[File:I. Fejedelmi eloterem 54.jpg|thumb|The Entrance Hall]]\nThe Royal Entrance Hall (''Fejedelmi el\u0151terem''), on the first floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing, gave access to the rooms of the Private Royal Apartments of King Franz Joseph I. The private apartments were situated in the southwestern part of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, their windows opening towards the hills of Buda. The Royal Entrance Hall was connected through a wide passageway to the main staircase hall. The spacious, oblong-shaped hall was divided in three, with two pairs of Ionic marble columns supporting [[architrave]]s. The central part of the room was much longer than the bays at the ends. Doors connected the hall with the rooms of the private apartments. In the middle of the longer wall stood an ornate stone mantelpiece with the bust of Franz Joseph. On the other side, three windows opened to the inner courtyard of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing. The ceiling was stuccoed and the side walls of the hall were covered with marble.\n\n===== Antechamber =====\n[[File:Eloterem 58.jpg|thumb|left|Antechamber]]\nThe antechamber (''El\u0151terem'') of the private apartments opened from the Royal Entrance Hall. It had three windows facing toward the hills. The room had a typical [[Biedermeier]] white-golden stucco decoration with floral wallpapers, resembling to the cosy rooms of [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]]. All the rooms of the private apartments followed this Viennese style favoured by the King. The antechamber was furnished with a stone mantelpiece (with a mirror above), an [[Empire (style)|Empire]] crystal chandelier, a stone flowerpot standing on a fluted column and Neo-Renaissance table with chairs.\n\n===== Audience Room =====\n[[File:Fogadoszoba 59.jpg|thumb|The Audience Room]]\nThe audience room (''Fogad\u00f3szoba'') of Franz Joseph I was situated in a corner of the private apartments wing, with two windows opening southwards and three windows opening westwards. It had a beautiful stuccoed and frescoed ceiling. The walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, a golden Rococo console table with a large mirror and a parlour suite.\n\n===== Writing Room =====\n[[File:Iroszoba 60.png|thumb|left|Writing room in the royal suite]]\nThe writing room (''\u00cdr\u00f3szoba'') of Franz Joseph had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white cocklestove, a table and chairs. To the right and left two similar parlours opened from the room.\n\n===== Royal Bedroom =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, I. Fejedelmi Haloszoba.png|thumb|Bedroom of the king]]\nThe bedroom (''Fejedelmi h\u00e1l\u00f3szoba'') of the king had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, the baldachined royal bed and a [[folding screen]]. The bedroom was connected to a dressing room, a private bathroom and smaller rooms belonging to the butler and the servants.\n\n===== Royal Dining Hall =====\n[[File:I. Fejedelmi Ebedlo 57.jpg|thumb|left|The Dining Room]]\nThe Royal Dining Hall (''Fejedelmi eb\u00e9dl\u0151'') opened from the Royal Entrance Hall, and it was the largest room of the private apartments. The long hall had six windows opening towards [[Gell\u00e9rt Hill]]. Three crystal chandeliers gave light to the elegant stuccoed space. In the middle of the longer side wall, between the two doors, stood a marble mantelpiece.\n\n===== \"Circle\" Room =====\n[[File:Circle Terem 56.jpg|thumb|The \"Circle\" Room]]\nThe \"Circle\" Room (''\"Circle\" terem'') opened from the Royal Dining Hall. It was the last room of the private apartments on the southern side, with three windows opening towards Gell\u00e9rt Hill. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white cocklestove and chairs.\n\n===== Dining Room =====\n[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Ebedlo.png|thumb|left|The Dining Room in the royal guest suite]]\nThe small dining room (''Eb\u00e9dl\u0151'') was situated in the northern part of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing, among the other rooms of the Royal Guest Suite. Four windows opened towards Krisztinav\u00e1ros. The ceiling was stuccoed, while the walls were covered with carved wooden panelling and wallpaper. A stone mantelpiece and large painting above it (depicting a hunting scene with a deer) gave a homey feeling to the room. It was furnished with a crystal chandelier and a long dining table with 12 chairs.\n\n==== Archducal Apartments ====\nThese apartments, on the ground floor of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros Wing, were designed in 1902 for [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] (1872\u20131962), the head of the Hungarian branch of the Habsburgs and his wife, [[Princess Auguste of Bavaria (1875\u20131964)|Archduchess Augusta]] (1875\u20131964). They could be reached from the lobby of the Krisztinav\u00e1ros wing through a long passageway. The most important rooms were (in due course): the ''salon'', where guests were entertained; the ''great parlour''; ''parlour''; ''dining room''; the ''Archduke's study''; the ''Archduke's bedroom''; the ''Archduchess' bedroom''; the ''Archduchess' study''; and the ''breakfast parlour''. All rooms had a relatively simple decoration with white stuccoed ceilings and stucco panels above the doorways. The walls were covered with wallpaper. Crystal chandeliers, stone mantelpieces and typical turn-of-the-century furniture gave the rooms a homey ambiance. The great parlour was decorated with large paintings.\n\n==Works of art==\nThe castle and its gardens have been decorated with works of art since their foundation in the 14th century. Only written sources speak about the most important medieval works, but detailed pictorial and written information exists about the 19th-century artistic decoration of the palace, which was mainly created by the most important Hungarian artists of the era. Many of the statues survived the destruction during the siege of Budapest in 1944\u201345 and were later restored. On the other hand, important works of art were destroyed during the controversial reconstruction of the castle during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n===Sculptural monuments===\n[[File:Budapest, Castle Hill, 1014 Hungary - panoramio (36).jpg|thumb|Matthias Fountain|alt=|255x255px]]\n;Matthias Fountain (''M\u00e1ty\u00e1s k\u00fatja'')\nThe spectacular fountain decorates the western forecourt of the palace. It shows a group of hunters led by King Matthias Corvinus together with hounds, a killed deer, Galeotto Marzio with a hawk and Sz\u00e9p Ilonka with a doe. This group of people stands between fallen rocks with water running down into a basin. The fountain was made by sculptor Alajos Str\u00f3bl. The dead deer was modelled upon a majestic stag killed in 1896 by poachers in the forest owned by Str\u00f3bl. The damaged sculpture was restored after the war. Nowadays it is probably the most photographed object in the palace.\n\n;Monument of Prince Eugene of Savoy\nThe equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy stands on the Danube terrace, in a prominent position, high above Budapest. The Neo-Baroque statue was made by sculptor [[J\u00f3zsef R\u00f3na]] for the town of [[Senta|Zenta]], but the town could not afford the price. The monument was bought in 1900 as a temporary solution until the planned equestrian statue of King Franz Joseph was completed. This never happened, so Prince Eugen remained on his plinth. The plinth is decorated with two bronze reliefs showing the capture of the earth-works in Zenta and the decisive cavalry charge in the Battle of Zenta in 1697.\n\n[[File:Budapest princ Eugen 1.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of Prince Eugene of Savoy[[File:Turul and Hungarian flag.jpg|thumb|left|The mythological [[Turul]] bird]]]][[File:Csik\u00f3s statue by Gy\u00f6rgy Vastagh, Hunyadi Courtyard, Royal Palace. 2009 BudapestDSCN3859.jpg|thumb|Statue of the horseherd|alt=|240x240px]]\n;Horseherd (''Csik\u00f3s'')\nThe statue of the [[Hortob\u00e1gy National Park]] horseherd taming a wild horse originally stood in front of the Riding School in the former \u00dajvil\u00e1g terrace. It is the work of Gy\u00f6rgy Vastagh from 1901. The statue was displayed in the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris (1900). The damaged statue was removed during the 1960s, but it was later restored and erected in the western forecourt of the palace in 1983, next to the Matthias Fountain.\n\n;Turulbird (''Turulmad\u00e1r'')\nThe mythological Turul, high above the Danube, was made by [[Gyula Don\u00e1th]] in 1905. The plinth and the ornate Neo-Baroque rail ([[Gyula Jungfer]]'s work) was seriously damaged during the siege of Buda, but they were restored in 1981, together with the broken coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary on the plinth.\n\n[[File:BudapestDSCN3839.JPG|thumb|''Fishing Children'' by K\u00e1roly Senyei]]\n;Fishing Children\nThe Fountain of the Fishing Children on the Danube terrace is the work of sculptor K\u00e1roly Senyei from 1912. It depicts two children grappling with a fish. The fine workmanship of the fishing net is remarkable. The fountain was removed in 1955 and re-erected at R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Square in Pest, but brought back to its original place in 1976. It was restored in 2001.\n\n;Csongor and T\u00fcnde\nThe two statues depicting Csongor and T\u00fcnde, literary figures from [[Mih\u00e1ly V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty]]'s drama, originally decorated the Habsburg Steps in front of the palace. They are the works of sculptor [[Mikl\u00f3s Ligeti]] from 1903. The steps were demolished after the war, but the statues were saved and re-erected in 1976 on top of two simple concrete plinths near their original locations.\n\n;Lions\nTwo pairs of lions guard the monumental gate leading into Lions Court. The four statues are the works of J\u00e1nos Fadrusz from 1901. The animals standing on the outer side of the gate are calm and dignified, while the inner ones are menacing. One lion was broken in two pieces during the war, but it was recreated in the 1950s.\n\n;War and Peace\n\n[[File:V\u00e1rbels\u0151.jpg|thumb|left|One of the lions in the inner courtyard]]\nThe monumental allegorical bronze statues of War and Peace stand beside the entrance to the Budapest History Museum. They are the work of K\u00e1roly Senyei. Both War and Peace are represented by angels, one with a trumpet, the other with an olive branch. Under the angel of Peace is a returning soldier, while under the angel of War there is a dead Ottoman soldier and ancient Hungarian warriors.\n\nThere are sepulchral monuments in the Palatinal Crypt decorated with the statues of [[Gy\u00f6rgy Zala (sculptor)|Gy\u00f6rgy Zala]], Alajos Str\u00f3bl and K\u00e1roly Senyei.\n\n== Lost works of art ==\n\n;Hungaria\nThe monumental sculpture group decorated the main (northern) fa\u00e7ade of the palace, facing Szent Gy\u00f6rgy Square. On the top of the attic, crowning the fa\u00e7ade, stood the female figure of Hungaria, the allegorical representation of Hungary. Two semi-nude figures sat at her side, one male and one female, representing Industry and Commerce. The group was made by sculptor Gyula Jankovits in 1905. The sculpture was destroyed, together with the whole northern fa\u00e7ade, during the 1950s.\n\n;Pediment Group\nThe pediment above the Habsburg Steps was decorated with an allegorical group of K\u00e1roly Senyei representing the ''Apotheosis of the Dual Monarchy''. It was destroyed during the 1950s, together with the great coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary which originally crowned the fa\u00e7ade. The present-day pediment is plain, without any sculptural decoration.\n\n;Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty\nThe ceiling of the Habsburg Room was decorated with a fresco representing the apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty. It was the last important work of K\u00e1roly Lotz, painted in 1903, one year before his death. The artist was already seriously ill when he worked on the fresco. The \"Apotheosis\" followed the traditions of Baroque court painting, and the work was praised by contemporary critics. The fresco survived the war unscathed, but it was destroyed in the 1950s.\n\n==Museums and institutions==\n{{Main|Hungarian National Gallery|National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library}}\n[[File:Floor plans of Buda Castle en.svg|thumb|The ground plan of the castle complex, with the location of the museums]]\n[[File:Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest, Hungr\u00eda - panoramio (31).jpg|thumb|Baroque Oroszl\u00e1nos Gate of the Hungarian National Gallery]]\nThe Budapest History Museum is located in the southern wing of Buda Castle, in Building E, over four floors. It presents the history of Budapest from its beginnings until the modern era. The restored part of the medieval castle, including the Royal Chapel and the rib-vaulted Gothic Hall, belongs to the exhibition. The highlights of the exhibition are the Gothic statues of Buda Castle and a 14th-century silk tapestry decorated with the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] coats of arms. Small gardens were recreated in the medieval zwingers around the oldest parts of the building.\n\nThe Hungarian National Gallery is located in Building A, B, C and D. The museum presents the history of Hungarian art from the 11th century until the present, with a special exhibition concentrating on Gothic altarpieces (housed in the former Baroque Ballroom). The only surviving interior from the pre-war Royal Palace, the Palatinal Crypt, belongs to the museum.\n\n\"Building F\" is occupied by the National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library, the national library of Hungary. Its collection of rare and antique books, [[codices]] and manuscripts contains 35 Corvina pieces from the famous library of King Matthias Corvinus. The original Bibliotheca Corviniana was housed in the medieval Royal Castle of Buda.\n\n== The cellars and caves ==\nDuring the Ottoman era, the extensive cave system was utilized by the hunters to store tigers and Hungarian mountain bears.\n\nThe cellars stored an ornate wine collection from the Ergi wine growing region in the Northern frontier of Hungary.\n\nVZ\n\n==Honors==\nPostage stamps depicting the castle were issued by Hungary on 26 March 1926<ref>https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/180760-Palace_of_Buda-Palace_of_Buda-Hungary</ref> on 1 June 1967<ref>https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/134434-Diesel_Ship_Hunyadi_Buda_Castle_Hungarian_Flag-Danube_Commission-Hungary</ref> on 30 April 1986<ref>https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/169712-Buda_Castle_cable_railway_reopening-Events-Hungary</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 Palace]], summer residence of the Hungarian monarchs\n* [[The House of Houdini]]\n* [[Medieval Royal Palace (Buda Castle)]]\n* [[Palace Chapel (Buda Castle)]]\n* [[Palatinal Crypt]]\n* [[Hofburg Palace]]\n* [[S\u00e1ndor Palace]], residence of the president of Hungary\n* [[List of castles in Hungary]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Proh\u00e1szka: Szoborhist\u00f3ri\u00e1k, Bp, 2004, pp.&nbsp;145\u2013150.\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===History===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [http://budavar.btk.mta.hu/en/art-monuments/the-royal-palace-of-buda.html K\u00e1roly Magyar: The Royal Palace of Buda] in the online database [[The Castle of Buda (online database)|The Castle of Buda]]\n* Mikl\u00f3s Horler: Budapest m\u0171eml\u00e9kei I, Bp: 1955, pp.&nbsp;259\u2013307\n* Gy\u00f6rgy Kel\u00e9nyi: A kir\u00e1lyi udvar \u00e9p\u00edtkez\u00e9sei Pest-Bud\u00e1n a XVIII. sz\u00e1zadban, Bp: Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, 2005, pp.&nbsp;27\u201334\n* Gy\u00f6rgy Kel\u00e9nyi: A kir\u00e1lyi udvar \u00e9p\u00edtkez\u00e9sei Pest-Bud\u00e1n a XVIII. sz\u00e1zadban, Bp: Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, 2005, pp.&nbsp;34\u201338\n* L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ger\u0151: A helyre\u00e1ll\u00edtott budai v\u00e1r, Bp, 1980, pp.&nbsp;11\u201360.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070706132444/http://szabadbolcseszet.elte.hu/index.php?option=com_tanelem&tip=0&id_tanelem=593 P\u00e9ter Farbaky: Magyar \u00fajkori \u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9szet]\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Buda Castle}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120513202500/http://www.citylive.hu/budai-var Buda Castle live webcam]\n* [http://www.legifoto.com/magyar/galeria/varnegyed/ Aerial photographs of the Castle]\n{{Refend}}\n\n===Interior===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [http://arch.et.bme.hu/arch_old/korabbi_folyam/29/29fekete.html Architectura Hungariae 8(2006), 1] \u2013 with grounds plan and photos.\n{{Refend}}\n\n===Works of art===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{in lang|hu}} [http://mek.oszk.hu/04000/04094/html/eletrajz.htm About K\u00e1roly Lotz's fresco]\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Budapest}}\n{{Imperial and Royal residences}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Hungary}}\n{{Hungary articles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Buda Castle| ]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Budapest]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in Hungary]]\n[[Category:V\u00e1rker\u00fclet]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Budapest]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1265]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in the 13th century]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in the 15th century]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1769]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1912]]\n[[Category:Art Nouveau houses]]\n[[Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Budapest]]\n[[Category:Baroque architecture in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Baroque Revival architecture]]\n[[Category:Medieval architecture]]\n[[Category:13th-century establishments in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Hungary]]\n", "name_user": "Sodacan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe cellars and caves", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buda_Castle"}

Salazar is best known for his performances in the [[New York City Marathon]] in the early 1980s and his 1982 [[Boston Marathon]] victory known as the \"Duel in the Sun.\" He held American track records of 13:11.93 for 5,000 m on July 6, 1982 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden and 27:25.61 for 10,000 m on June 26, 1982 in [[Oslo]], Norway.\n\nSalazar was the head coach of the [[Nike Oregon Project]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He won the [[IAAF]] Coaching Achievement Award in 2013 during a ceremony hosted by the International Athletics Foundation in [[Monaco]].\n\nIn June 2015, Salazar was named in a joint [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and [[ProPublica]] investigation into doping allegations.\n\nIn 2019 Salazar was banned for 4 years from athletics for [[#Doping investigations|doping offenses]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url= https://www.usada.org/sanction/aaa-panel-4-year-sanctions-alberto-salazar-jeffrey-brown/ |title =AAA Panel Imposes 4-Year Sanctions on Alberto Salazar and Dr. Jeffrey Brown for Multiple Anti-Doping Rule Violations |accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref> The Nike Oregon Project was shut down in the wake of the controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a29432537/after-salazar-ban-nike-shuts-down-oregon-project/|title=After Salazar Ban, Nike Shuts Down Oregon Project|last=Sgobba|first=Christa|date=2019-10-11|website=Runner's World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>  \n\nHe was further mired in controversy after the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' published a video [[op-ed]] from his former athlete [[Mary Cain (athlete)|Mary Cain]]. <ref>{{cite news|title=I was the fastest girl in the world until I joined Nike|first=Mary|last=Cain|work=New York Times|date=November 7, 2019|accessdate=November 7, 2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html}}</ref>\n\n==Running career==\n\n===High school===\nBorn in Cuba, Salazar grew up in [[Wayland, Massachusetts]]. His father Jose was a close friend of [[Fidel Castro]] and fellow [[Cuban revolution]]ary, who became an opponent of the Communist government and member of the [[anti-Castro]] movement.{{r|brant200404}} The younger Salazar was an outstanding high school runner who was state cross country champion in 1975. He trained w\u0131th the well known [[Greater Boston Track Club]] (whose members included the likes of [[Bill Rodgers (athlete)|Bill Rodgers]], Randy Thomas, and [[Greg Meyer]]) where he was given the nickname of \"the rookie\".\n\n===Collegiate===\nFrom Massachusetts he went to the [[University of Oregon]] where he won numerous All American honors, was a member of the 1977 NCAA cross country championship team, and won the individual NCAA cross country championship in 1978. Salazar won the 1978 NCAA national cross country championship in cold, snowy conditions, handing Track & Field News Athlete of the Year [[Henry Rono]] one of his few losses of the year. He finished 2nd to Rono in a memorable duel at the 1979 NCAA national cross country championships at [[Lehigh University]], in which Rono (28:19) and Salazar (28:28) ran the 3rd and 5th fastest 10,000 meter cross country times in NCAA championship history. Neither time has been matched in over three decades of NCAA cross country competition since then. After that, he finished third in the Olympic Trials 10,000 meter race in  28:10.42<ref name=\"runnersworld.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20835941/the-1980-u-s-track-field-trials/|title=The 1980 U.S. Track & Field Trials|date=October 1, 1980|website=Runner's World}}</ref> to make the 1980 Olympic team (which didn't compete in the Olympics in Moscow due to the U.S. boycott) and received one of 461 [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medal]]s created especially for the spurned athletes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caroccioli|first1=Tom|last2=Caroccioli|first2=Jerry|title=Boycott: Stolen Dreams of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=Highland Park, IL|isbn=978-0942257403|pages=243\u2013253}}</ref> He broke the American indoor 5,000 meter record in February 1981 at the [[Millrose Games]] in New York (his 13:22.6 beating the old AR by nearly 20 seconds as he finished second behind [[Suleiman Nyambui]], who broke the indoor world record with a 13:20.4). Salazar and Bill Rodgers had a legendary duel at the Gurnet Classic Beach Run in Duxbury during the 1970s. At the 1978 [[Falmouth Road Race]] after fading to 10th place, he collapsed at the finish with a temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit (41.7&nbsp;\u00b0C) and was read his last rites prematurely.<ref name=\"si_4Sept1978\">{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kenny|title=Even In A Crowd He Runs Alone|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=September 4, 1978|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135819/1/index.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"si_31Oct2007\">{{cite journal|last=Wolff|first=Alexander|title=No Finish Line|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=October 31, 2007|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1058763/index.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Post-collegiate===\nFrom 1980 through 1982, Salazar won three consecutive [[New York City Marathon]]s.{{r|brant200404}} His first-ever marathon, the 1980 New York City race, resulted in a 2:09:41 win, at the time the fastest American debut and the second-fastest time recorded by a U.S. runner (behind Bill Rodgers' 2:09:27 at [[Boston Marathon|Boston]] in 1979). He was on that week's cover of Sports Illustrated after the victory. In 1981, Salazar set an apparent world record at the [[New York City Marathon]] of 2:08:13, surpassing the 12-year-old mark of 2:08:33 set by Australian [[Derek Clayton]] in 1969 in Antwerp, Belgium. However, the course was found on re-measurement to be about 148 meters short of the 42.195 kilometre (26 miles, 385 yards) distance. This is equivalent to about 27 seconds.\n\nIn 1982 he won his first and only [[Boston Marathon]] after the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with [[Dick Beardsley]].<ref name=sports-reference/> Salazar won the race in an exciting sprint finish and collapsed at the end before being taken to an emergency room and given six liters of saline solution intravenously because he had not drunk during the race.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brant|first=John|title=Duel In The Sun: Alberto Salazar, Dick Beardsley, and America's greatest marathon|publisher=Rodale|year=2006|pages=96|isbn=1-59486-262-1}}</ref> Salazar ended the year ranked #1 in the world in the marathon by [[Track & Field News]] magazine for his wins in Boston and New York, #1 in their North American Road Rankings for his American 10K road record win of 28:04 at the Orange Bowl 10K and his course record of 31:53 at the highly competitive Falmouth {{convert|7.1|mi|km|adj=on}} road race (his second win and course record there), #8 in the world (and #1 American with an AR of 13:11.93) in the 5,000 meters, and #2 in the world in the 10,000 meters, with three second-place finishes at Eugene (27:30.0), at Oslo in an American Record of 27:25.61, and at Paris (27:29.06).\n\nSalazar enjoyed success in cross country competition, earning several All American honors in collegiate and post-collegiate national championships. Salazar was also the U.S. national cross country champion in 1979. He fared well at the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]], finishing second in 1982 and fourth in 1983.  His silver medal in 1982 marks the last time an American male reached the podium in World Cross Country.\n\nIn addition to a fourth-place finish (only one second behind the top three placers) at the 1983 world cross country championships, Salazar twice broke the American 10&nbsp;km road record in 1983 with efforts of 28:02 and 28:01 at the Americas 10&nbsp;km and Continental Homes 10&nbsp;km respectively. He finished as the top ranker in Track & Field News magazine's North American Road Rankings for 1983. He was also the 10,000 meter national track champion in 1983, pulling away from [[Craig Virgin]] in the last straightaway at the U.S. championships in Indiana in June to win his second such title (the first coming in 1981). However, he finished last in the 10,000 meters at the World Track & Field Championships while suffering from bronchitis and was beaten for the first time in the marathon, finishing fifth at the Rotterdam marathon in April (2:10:08) and then fifth again at Fukuoka in December (2:09:21). (The latter time would have been the American Record for the next 17 years except that there was a problem in filing the paperwork with the authorities.)\n\nIn 1984, after a 2nd-place finish by Salazar in the 10,000 meters at the [[Mt. SAC Relays]] in 27:45.5, he finished 2nd at the men's Olympic marathon trials (2:11:44) to become a member of the United States' [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|Olympic Marathon Team]], along with [[Pete Pfitzinger]] and John Tuttle.  He was considered a favorite to win or medal in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], but finished a disappointing 15th in 2:14:19 under the hot Los Angeles sun.\n\nSalazar's competitive decline is often attributed to the stress on his body from the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with Beardsley.{{r|brant200404}} Salazar recounts falling into a \"more-is-better\" mindset which led him to reason that if 120 miles per week yielded a certain level of success, then {{convert|180|mi|km}} or even {{convert|200|mi|km}} would bring even better results. This intense and grueling regimen of such extremely long distances led to a breakdown of his immune system, and he found himself frequently sick, injured, and otherwise unable to continue training. The story of Salazar's 1982 win at the Boston Marathon and his subsequent competitive decline is told in ''[[Duel in the Sun (book)|Duel in the Sun]]'' by John Brant.\n\nAfter failing to make the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|1988 Olympic Marathon Team]] Salazar opened a successful restaurant in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. Although only able to stagger through four or five miles per run, he remained obsessed with training; Brant wrote that \"He couldn't run, yet he couldn't stop running.\" Salazar unsuccessfully visited the Stanford Sleep Clinic and a cardiologist, had surgery, and trained in Kenya. In 1994 he said that \"For most of the last 10 years, I hated running. I hated it with a passion. I used to wish for a cataclysmic injury in which I would lose one of my legs. I know that sounds terrible, but if I had lost a leg, then I wouldn't have to torture myself anymore.\"{{r|brant200404}}\n\nA doctor diagnosed Salazar's running problems and [[exercise-induced asthma]] as largely due to the 1982 marathon, and successfully prescribed [[Prozac]] to improve his physical symptoms and depression. Salazar closed his restaurant, began training again at the age of 34, and in 1994 won the prestigious {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Comrades Marathon]]. He soon retired from competing, believing that he had nothing left to prove as a runner, and became a running coach.<ref name=\"brant200404\">{{cite news | url=http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | title=Duel in the Sun | work=Runner's World | date=April 2004 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Brant, John | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916172517/http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | archive-date=September 16, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Salazar stated that Prozac played a role in motivating him to succeed in professional running again; the actual effect of the drug on his performance remains controversial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salazar's Drug Claim a Concern|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-03/sports/9407020194_1_prozac-side-effects-endocrine-system|work=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>\n\n==Post-competitive career==\nAfter his competition career, Salazar moved into coaching.

[[long-distance running|long-distance runner]] and a doping offender. Born in [[Cuba]], Salazar immigrated to the United States as a child with his family. They moved to [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]], [[Connecticut]] and then to [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], [[Massachusetts]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/salazar_alberto_1958_/#.WDWeZmMrLD4|title=Alberto Salazar (1958 - )|website=oregonencyclopedia.org}}</ref> where Salazar competed in track and field in high school. Salazar is best known for his performances in the [[New York City Marathon]] in the early 1980s and his 1982 [[Boston Marathon]] victory known as the \"Duel in the Sun.\" He held American track records of 13:11.93 for 5,000 m on July 6, 1982 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden and 27:25.61 for 10,000 m on June 26, 1982 in [[Oslo]], Norway.\n\nSalazar was the head coach of the [[Nike Oregon Project]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He won the [[IAAF]] Coaching Achievement Award in 2013 during a ceremony hosted by the International Athletics Foundation in [[Monaco]].\n\nIn June 2015, Salazar was named in a joint [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and [[ProPublica]] investigation into doping allegations.\n\nIn 2019 Salazar was banned for 4 years from athletics for [[#Doping investigations|doping offenses]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url= https://www.usada.org/sanction/aaa-panel-4-year-sanctions-alberto-salazar-jeffrey-brown/ |title =AAA Panel Imposes 4-Year Sanctions on Alberto Salazar and Dr. Jeffrey Brown for Multiple Anti-Doping Rule Violations |accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref> The Nike Oregon Project was shut down in the wake of the controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a29432537/after-salazar-ban-nike-shuts-down-oregon-project/|title=After Salazar Ban, Nike Shuts Down Oregon Project|last=Sgobba|first=Christa|date=2019-10-11|website=Runner's World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>  \n\nHe was further mired in controversy after the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' published a video [[op-ed]] from his former athlete [[Mary Cain (athlete)|Mary Cain]]. <ref>{{cite news|title=I was the fastest girl in the world until I joined Nike|first=Mary|last=Cain|work=New York Times|date=November 7, 2019|accessdate=November 7, 2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html}}</ref>\n\n==Running career==\n\n===High school===\nBorn in Cuba, Salazar grew up in [[Wayland, Massachusetts]]. His father Jose was a close friend of [[Fidel Castro]] and fellow [[Cuban revolution]]ary, who became an opponent of the Communist government and member of the [[anti-Castro]] movement.{{r|brant200404}} The younger Salazar was an outstanding high school runner who was state cross country champion in 1975. He trained w\u0131th the well known [[Greater Boston Track Club]] (whose members included the likes of [[Bill Rodgers (athlete)|Bill Rodgers]], Randy Thomas, and [[Greg Meyer]]) where he was given the nickname of \"the rookie\".\n\n===Collegiate===\nFrom Massachusetts he went to the [[University of Oregon]] where he won numerous All American honors, was a member of the 1977 NCAA cross country championship team, and won the individual NCAA cross country championship in 1978. Salazar won the 1978 NCAA national cross country championship in cold, snowy conditions, handing Track & Field News Athlete of the Year [[Henry Rono]] one of his few losses of the year. He finished 2nd to Rono in a memorable duel at the 1979 NCAA national cross country championships at [[Lehigh University]], in which Rono (28:19) and Salazar (28:28) ran the 3rd and 5th fastest 10,000 meter cross country times in NCAA championship history. Neither time has been matched in over three decades of NCAA cross country competition since then. After that, he finished third in the Olympic Trials 10,000 meter race in  28:10.42<ref name=\"runnersworld.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20835941/the-1980-u-s-track-field-trials/|title=The 1980 U.S. Track & Field Trials|date=October 1, 1980|website=Runner's World}}</ref> to make the 1980 Olympic team (which didn't compete in the Olympics in Moscow due to the U.S. boycott) and received one of 461 [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medal]]s created especially for the spurned athletes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caroccioli|first1=Tom|last2=Caroccioli|first2=Jerry|title=Boycott: Stolen Dreams of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=Highland Park, IL|isbn=978-0942257403|pages=243\u2013253}}</ref> He broke the American indoor 5,000 meter record in February 1981 at the [[Millrose Games]] in New York (his 13:22.6 beating the old AR by nearly 20 seconds as he finished second behind [[Suleiman Nyambui]], who broke the indoor world record with a 13:20.4). Salazar and Bill Rodgers had a legendary duel at the Gurnet Classic Beach Run in Duxbury during the 1970s. At the 1978 [[Falmouth Road Race]] after fading to 10th place, he collapsed at the finish with a temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit (41.7&nbsp;\u00b0C) and was read his last rites prematurely.<ref name=\"si_4Sept1978\">{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kenny|title=Even In A Crowd He Runs Alone|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=September 4, 1978|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135819/1/index.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"si_31Oct2007\">{{cite journal|last=Wolff|first=Alexander|title=No Finish Line|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=October 31, 2007|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1058763/index.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Post-collegiate===\nFrom 1980 through 1982, Salazar won three consecutive [[New York City Marathon]]s.{{r|brant200404}} His first-ever marathon, the 1980 New York City race, resulted in a 2:09:41 win, at the time the fastest American debut and the second-fastest time recorded by a U.S. runner (behind Bill Rodgers' 2:09:27 at [[Boston Marathon|Boston]] in 1979). He was on that week's cover of Sports Illustrated after the victory. In 1981, Salazar set an apparent world record at the [[New York City Marathon]] of 2:08:13, surpassing the 12-year-old mark of 2:08:33 set by Australian [[Derek Clayton]] in 1969 in Antwerp, Belgium. However, the course was found on re-measurement to be about 148 meters short of the 42.195 kilometre (26 miles, 385 yards) distance. This is equivalent to about 27 seconds.\n\nIn 1982 he won his first and only [[Boston Marathon]] after the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with [[Dick Beardsley]].<ref name=sports-reference/> Salazar won the race in an exciting sprint finish and collapsed at the end before being taken to an emergency room and given six liters of saline solution intravenously because he had not drunk during the race.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brant|first=John|title=Duel In The Sun: Alberto Salazar, Dick Beardsley, and America's greatest marathon|publisher=Rodale|year=2006|pages=96|isbn=1-59486-262-1}}</ref> Salazar ended the year ranked #1 in the world in the marathon by [[Track & Field News]] magazine for his wins in Boston and New York, #1 in their North American Road Rankings for his American 10K road record win of 28:04 at the Orange Bowl 10K and his course record of 31:53 at the highly competitive Falmouth {{convert|7.1|mi|km|adj=on}} road race (his second win and course record there), #8 in the world (and #1 American with an AR of 13:11.93) in the 5,000 meters, and #2 in the world in the 10,000 meters, with three second-place finishes at Eugene (27:30.0), at Oslo in an American Record of 27:25.61, and at Paris (27:29.06).\n\nSalazar enjoyed success in cross country competition, earning several All American honors in collegiate and post-collegiate national championships. Salazar was also the U.S. national cross country champion in 1979. He fared well at the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]], finishing second in 1982 and fourth in 1983.  His silver medal in 1982 marks the last time an American male reached the podium in World Cross Country.\n\nIn addition to a fourth-place finish (only one second behind the top three placers) at the 1983 world cross country championships, Salazar twice broke the American 10&nbsp;km road record in 1983 with efforts of 28:02 and 28:01 at the Americas 10&nbsp;km and Continental Homes 10&nbsp;km respectively. He finished as the top ranker in Track & Field News magazine's North American Road Rankings for 1983. He was also the 10,000 meter national track champion in 1983, pulling away from [[Craig Virgin]] in the last straightaway at the U.S. championships in Indiana in June to win his second such title (the first coming in 1981). However, he finished last in the 10,000 meters at the World Track & Field Championships while suffering from bronchitis and was beaten for the first time in the marathon, finishing fifth at the Rotterdam marathon in April (2:10:08) and then fifth again at Fukuoka in December (2:09:21). (The latter time would have been the American Record for the next 17 years except that there was a problem in filing the paperwork with the authorities.)\n\nIn 1984, after a 2nd-place finish by Salazar in the 10,000 meters at the [[Mt. SAC Relays]] in 27:45.5, he finished 2nd at the men's Olympic marathon trials (2:11:44) to become a member of the United States' [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|Olympic Marathon Team]], along with [[Pete Pfitzinger]] and John Tuttle.  He was considered a favorite to win or medal in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], but finished a disappointing 15th in 2:14:19 under the hot Los Angeles sun.\n\nSalazar's competitive decline is often attributed to the stress on his body from the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with Beardsley.{{r|brant200404}} Salazar recounts falling into a \"more-is-better\" mindset which led him to reason that if 120 miles per week yielded a certain level of success, then {{convert|180|mi|km}} or even {{convert|200|mi|km}} would bring even better results. This intense and grueling regimen of such extremely long distances led to a breakdown of his immune system, and he found himself frequently sick, injured, and otherwise unable to continue training. The story of Salazar's 1982 win at the Boston Marathon and his subsequent competitive decline is told in ''[[Duel in the Sun (book)|Duel in the Sun]]'' by John Brant.\n\nAfter failing to make the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|1988 Olympic Marathon Team]] Salazar opened a successful restaurant in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. Although only able to stagger through four or five miles per run, he remained obsessed with training; Brant wrote that \"He couldn't run, yet he couldn't stop running.\" Salazar unsuccessfully visited the Stanford Sleep Clinic and a cardiologist, had surgery, and trained in Kenya. In 1994 he said that \"For most of the last 10 years, I hated running. I hated it with a passion. I used to wish for a cataclysmic injury in which I would lose one of my legs. I know that sounds terrible, but if I had lost a leg, then I wouldn't have to torture myself anymore.\"{{r|brant200404}}\n\nA doctor diagnosed Salazar's running problems and [[exercise-induced asthma]] as largely due to the 1982 marathon, and successfully prescribed [[Prozac]] to improve his physical symptoms and depression. Salazar closed his restaurant, began training again at the age of 34, and in 1994 won the prestigious {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Comrades Marathon]]. He soon retired from competing, believing that he had nothing left to prove as a runner, and became a running coach.<ref name=\"brant200404\">{{cite news | url=http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | title=Duel in the Sun | work=Runner's World | date=April 2004 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Brant, John | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916172517/http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | archive-date=September 16, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Salazar stated that Prozac played a role in motivating him to succeed in professional running again; the actual effect of the drug on his performance remains controversial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salazar's Drug Claim a Concern|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-03/sports/9407020194_1_prozac-side-effects-endocrine-system|work=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>\n\n==Post-competitive career==\nAfter his competition career, Salazar moved into coaching.

He attributes this partially to the stress of coaching five Olympic-hopeful athletes. Afterwards, doctors adjusted his medications, but do not believe that there was any further injury to the heart. He returned to the track to coach his athletes through the trials.<ref>Joel Odom (June 29, 2008).

The book tracks Salazar's story from his family's roots in Cuba, his adolescence in Massachusetts, through his running career to present-day coaching efforts, culminating in his 14-minute-long heart stop in 2007.\n\n===Doping investigations===\nIn June 2015, Salazar was named in a joint [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and [[ProPublica]] investigation into doping allegations. This involved testimonies from various athletes and people associated with Salazar about alleged [[microdosing]] of [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] and [[prednisone]] at the [[Nike Oregon Project]]. Salazar declined to be interviewed for the programme, but denied any wrongdoing, saying in a statement that the \"allegations your sources are making are based upon false assumptions and half-truths in an attempt to further their personal agendas\".<ref name=\"BBC Panorama 3 June 2015\">{{cite news |last= Daly |first=Mark |title= Top athletics coach Alberto Salazar faces doping claims|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32877702 | date=June 3, 2015|website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate=June 3, 2015 }}</ref> One of the more high-profile allegations was made by former Nike Oregon Project athlete [[Kara Goucher]], who claimed she was pressured by Salazar to take thyroid medication not prescribed by her doctor to lose weight gained during her pregnancy in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kara Goucher Will Remain Publicly Silent on Doping Allegations Against Salazar|url = http://www.runnersworld.com/elite-runners/kara-goucher-will-remain-publicly-silent-on-doping-allegations-against-salazar|website = Runner's World|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref> The accusations were addressed by Salazar in public releases.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://nikeoregonproject.com/blogs/news/35522561-alberto-open-letter-part-1 |title= Alberto Open Letter Part 1 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://nikeoregonproject.com/blogs/news/35523713-alberto-open-letter-part-2 |title= Alberto Open Letter Part 2 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> \n\nShortly after the allegations, [[Josh Rohatinsky]], who trained under Salazar at the Nike Oregon Project from 2007 until July 2009, used [[Facebook]] to describe both Galen Rupp's relationship with Salazar and the athlete's improved performance as \"highly suspicious\". In the social media posting, Rohatinsky claimed that there had been a \"wall of separation\" between Salazar and Rupp and the rest of the athletes. He also expressed his belief in \"the full extent\" of the witnesses' evidence which appeared in the BBC documentary adding that he also believed that all activity relating to performance-enhancing drugs during his own time at the NOP had been \"limited to Galen Rupp\".<ref name=\"BBC News 14 June 2015\">{{cite web | title= Alberto Salazar: Ex-Oregon Project runner backs BBC's doping claims |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/33125707| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= June 14, 2015| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= June 14, 2015}}</ref> \n\nOn October 1, 2019, USADA banned Salazar and Dr. Jeffery Brown, a colleague at the Oregon Project, for doping offences.<ref name=\"auto\"/> These included using a [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]] prohibited method, tampering with doping control methods and trafficking [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] through a prohibited testing program.
