It was also the first of three consecutive No. 1 [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Albums for him.  The album was the first of more than a dozen Yoakam albums featuring his collaboration with [[record producer]]-[[guitarist]] [[Pete Anderson]].\n\n==Background==\nWhen he began his career, Nashville was oriented toward pop \"[[urban cowboy]]\" music, and Yoakam's brand of hip [[honky tonk]] music was not considered marketable.  He later recalled, \"Mid-eighties it was pretty pop-country. Early to mid-eighties. But there were some great beacons of light for traditional country music on the scene at the time. [[George Strait]] had had several hits at that point. [[Ricky Skaggs]] was a real beacon for everybody in my generation who wanted to point to the fact that traditional country music could still sell, and still was pertinent to an audience. I think it\u2019s incumbent upon the individual artist in any given generation to maintain their contact with the traditional forms and the fundamental aspects of any genre.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vice.com/title= Interview - Dwight Yoakam Gave Me the History of Country Rock in Los Angeles|last=Millard|first=Drew|date=January 2013|work=vice.com|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>  A Kentucky native, Yoakam grew up listening to records by [[Stonewall Jackson]] and [[Johnny Cash]], while also being influenced by rock acts like [[The Byrds]] and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], but the Bakersfield sound, typified by country artists like [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]], had a lasting influence on his musical direction and songwriting.  He recorded some demos in 1981 but, after not making much headway in Nashville, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] and worked towards bringing his particular brand of new honky tonk or \"hillbilly\" music (as he called it) forward into the 1980s. Writing all his own songs, and continuing to perform mostly outside traditional country music channels, he did many shows in rock and [[punk rock]] clubs around Los Angeles, playing with roots rock or punk rock acts like [[The Blasters]], [[Los Lobos]], and [[X (American band)|X]]. This helped him diversify his audience beyond the typical country music fans, and his authentic, [[Honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk]] revivalism brought rock audiences closer to country music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography|title=Dwight Yoakam|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>  In the 2003 documentary series ''Lost Highway'', Yoakam states, \"We were reinterpreting the Bakersfield 'shuffle sound' of Buck Owens and what he was doing with that terse kind of shuffle.\"\n\n==Recording==\nYoakam\u2019s debut was produced by guitarist Pete Anderson, whose abilities as an arranger complimented the singer\u2019s skills as a songwriter.  As Anderson later recalled, \u201cDwight\u2019s a brilliant lyricist, with a great voice as a gift from God.  And a gift for composition.  He didn\u2019t struggle to write\u2026And at the time, he didn\u2019t want to do any of the things I wanted to do, and I didn\u2019t want to do any of things he wanted to do, which made it non-competitive.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=68-69}} Comparing the recordings with Anderson on his debut with the demos the singer recorded in Nashville in 1981, writer Don McLeese observes:\n\n{{quote|By catching the attention of Pete Anderson, Yoakam found the sonic architect who could frame his voice, provide an instrumental foil with a stinging guitar, and streamline his arrangements to the best advantage.  It\u2019s mainly hindsight that makes those 1981 arrangements sound busy, as if the guitars and fiddles were chasing each other\u2019s tails, but what Anderson added was clearly crucial, making the sound as important as the songs\u2026Whatever polish Pete provided, his guitar gave Yoakam\u2019s songs more raw intensity than anything on those 1981 sessions.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=68-70}}}}\n \n''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' originally appeared as a six-track 12\u201d EP version released in 1984 through a tiny independent label Oak Records.  In the notes to the four-disc ''Reprise Please Baby'' box set, Yoakam explained his musical dynamic like this: \u201cYou combine drummers with mountain people, and you\u2019ve got hillbilly music.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing: [[Bill Monroe]] with drums.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=71}}  Regarding the recordings, Anderson later commented that he was particularly concerned with \u201cmaking it cohesive in terms of intros, outros, and solos, that was done on that record, every song.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=72}}  The EP\u2019s success led to Yoakam being signed by Warner Bros. and releasing the same EP with four additional tracks and nearly identical packaging, making him one of the few artists whose major-label debut carried the note that it contained previously released material.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=75}}  \n\n==Composition==\nYoakam composed six of the album\u2019s ten songs, including the title track.  The song, with Anderson's [[Don Rich]]-influenced guitar style, walks the Buck Owens line until the line extends to Yoakam, and Yoakam's street poetry is both poignant and profound, built into a barroom anthem.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/los-lobos-p99039/biography|title=Los Lobos - Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>  According to Don McLeese\u2019s book ''Dwight Yoakam: A Thousand Miles from Nowhere'', it wasn\u2019t until the expansion into the Reprise LP that the singer was inspired to write the song \u201cGuitars, Cadillacs,\u201d with the \u201cand hillbilly music\u201d replacing the \u201cetceteras\u201d that appeared on the original EP cover, and the executives at Warner Bros. balked, fearing that the Kentucky-born artist\u2019s evocation of what the label considered trailer trash \"was like waving a rebel flag at the possibility of mainstream success.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=13}}  [[Steve Earle]], who rose to fame around the same time as Yoakam and included a song he wrote called \"Hillbilly Highway\" on his 1986 breakout album ''Guitar Town'', later observed, \"What we had in common is that we use the term 'hillbilly,' which pissed [[George Jones]] off.  He said one time, 'We spent all these years trying not to be called hillbillies, and Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle fucked it up in one day.'\"{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=75}} McLeese writes:\n\n{{quote|The \u201chillbilly\u201d tag was something that country had made a concerted effort to ditch, from the countrypolitan sophistication of [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Billy Sherrill]] productions through the slick suburbanization of ''Urban Cowboy''.  And here was this punk upstart, tracking manure all over the split-level home that country music had built for itself, reminding listeners of the music\u2019s outhouse era.  \u201cThey asked Pete if he could get me to change it, take the hillbilly out,\u201d says Yoakam.  \u201cAnd Pete knew better.  He said, \u201cNo way.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=75-76}}}}  \n\nOther songs, such as the \u201cstone country\u201d barroom lament \u201cIt Won\u2019t Hurt\u201d and the heartfelt ballad \u201cSouth of Cincinnati,\u201d display Yoakam\u2019s remarkable depth and understanding of country songwriting and storytelling, with the latter putting \u201can interesting twist on the songwriter\u2019s dual heritage in urban [[Ohio]] and rural [[Kentucky]]\u2026one that evokes the palpable change that occurs below the Mason-Dixon line, \u2018south of Cincinnati, down where the dogwood trees grow.\u2019\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=73}}  \u201cTwenty Years\u201d tells the vindictive tale of Henry, a man whose life is ruined after the woman he crossed lies in a district court, framing him for a crime he did not commit. (\"Tried to warn you, henry, not to cross her/Tried to tell you about her vengeful ways...\")  The bluegrass-influenced \u201cMiner\u2019s Prayer\u201d also looks to Kentucky, an acoustic number powered by dobro (courtesy of David Mansfield), flat-picked guitar, and Yoakam's singing of his grandfather and generations like him who lived and died in the mines of Kentucky, which AllMusic critic Thom Jurek describes as \u201cBill Monroe meets [[Ralph Stanley]] meets [[Bob Dylan]].\u201d<ref name=Allmusic/>  (Yoakam would later record the song with Stanley.)  Another Yoakam original, the prideful \u201cBury Me,\u201d had been demoed in 1981 and was rerecorded as a duet with [[Lone Justice]] vocalist [[Maria McKee]].  Yoakam later told ''Rolling Stone'' the song was \"basically a bluegrass in hiding.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/title=Dwight Yoakam on New Bluegrass Album, Prince and Musical Rebellion|last=Murray|first=Nick|date=September 2016|work=rollingstone.com|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter signing with [[Reprise]], Yoakam and Anderson added four additional cuts to the original EP, the most significant being a cover of [[Johnny Horton]]\u2019s 1956 hit \u201c[[Honky-Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]],\u201d which would kick off the major label LP and spend six months on the country charts, peaking at #3.  Along with being his first hit, Yoakam\u2019s \u201cHonky Tonk Man\u201d has the unique bragging rights of being the very first country-music video ever played on [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/title=Flashback: Dwight Yoakam Bridges Genres, Generations With Wild \u2018Guitars\u2019|last=Hodge|first=Will|date=August 2016|work=rollingstone.com|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>  The two other cover songs on the album, [[Harlan Howard]]\u2019s \u201c[[Heartaches by the Number]],\u201d originally made famous by [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], and [[June Carter]]\u2019s \u201c[[Ring of Fire]],\u201d the Johnny Cash classic, remained faithful to the spirit of country music but sounded brand new at the same time, placing Yoakam at the vanguard of what became known as the \u201cNew Traditionalist\u201d movement alongside he likes of [[Randy Travis]] and Steve Earle.  As one writer noted about \u201cHeartaches by the Number,\u201d \u201cBecause of Ed Black's steel playing, Brantley Kearns' fiddle, and Anderson's guitar, the accompaniment is stronger and far edgier than the Ray Price version, but from Yoakam's throat comes an entirely different story than Price's. In Price's case the song was a plea; in Yoakam's it's a statement of fact.\u201d<ref name=Allmusic/>  \n\nThe album was re-issued on October 17, 2006, complete with demos from 1981 and tracks recorded live at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] on Los Angeles' [[Sunset Strip]] in 1986.\n\n==Reception==\nThree of the album's tracks rose into the Top 40 of the [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1986.

His third single from the album was \"It Won't Hurt,\" which rose to No. 31. Yoakam was nominated for two Grammy awards in association with ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' and he won Top New Male Vocalist at the 1986 Academy of Country Music Awards.

It was also the first of three consecutive No. 1 [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Albums for him.  The album was the first of more than a dozen Yoakam albums featuring his collaboration with [[record producer]]-[[guitarist]] [[Pete Anderson]].\n\n==Background==\nWhen he began his career, Nashville was oriented toward pop \"[[urban cowboy]]\" music, and Yoakam's brand of hip [[honky tonk]] music was not considered marketable.  He later recalled, \"Mid-eighties it was pretty pop-country. Early to mid-eighties. But there were some great beacons of light for traditional country music on the scene at the time. [[George Strait]] had had several hits at that point. [[Ricky Skaggs]] was a real beacon for everybody in my generation who wanted to point to the fact that traditional country music could still sell, and still was pertinent to an audience. I think it\u2019s incumbent upon the individual artist in any given generation to maintain their contact with the traditional forms and the fundamental aspects of any genre.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vice.com/title= Interview - Dwight Yoakam Gave Me the History of Country Rock in Los Angeles|last=Millard|first=Drew|date=January 2013|work=vice.com|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>  A Kentucky native, Yoakam grew up listening to records by [[Stonewall Jackson]] and [[Johnny Cash]], while also being influenced by rock acts like [[The Byrds]] and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], but the Bakersfield sound, typified by country artists like [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]], had a lasting influence on his musical direction and songwriting.  He recorded some demos in 1981 but, after not making much headway in Nashville, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] and worked towards bringing his particular brand of new honky tonk or \"hillbilly\" music (as he called it) forward into the 1980s. Writing all his own songs, and continuing to perform mostly outside traditional country music channels, he did many shows in rock and [[punk rock]] clubs around Los Angeles, playing with roots rock or punk rock acts like [[The Blasters]], [[Los Lobos]], and [[X (American band)|X]]. This helped him diversify his audience beyond the typical country music fans, and his authentic, [[Honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk]] revivalism brought rock audiences closer to country music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography|title=Dwight Yoakam|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>  In the 2003 documentary series ''Lost Highway'', Yoakam states, \"We were reinterpreting the Bakersfield 'shuffle sound' of Buck Owens and what he was doing with that terse kind of shuffle.\"\n\n==Recording==\nYoakam\u2019s debut was produced by guitarist Pete Anderson, whose abilities as an arranger complimented the singer\u2019s skills as a songwriter.  As Anderson later recalled, \u201cDwight\u2019s a brilliant lyricist, with a great voice as a gift from God.  And a gift for composition.  He didn\u2019t struggle to write\u2026And at the time, he didn\u2019t want to do any of the things I wanted to do, and I didn\u2019t want to do any of things he wanted to do, which made it non-competitive.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=68-69}} Comparing the recordings with Anderson on his debut with the demos the singer recorded in Nashville in 1981, writer Don McLeese observes:\n\n{{quote|By catching the attention of Pete Anderson, Yoakam found the sonic architect who could frame his voice, provide an instrumental foil with a stinging guitar, and streamline his arrangements to the best advantage.  It\u2019s mainly hindsight that makes those 1981 arrangements sound busy, as if the guitars and fiddles were chasing each other\u2019s tails, but what Anderson added was clearly crucial, making the sound as important as the songs\u2026Whatever polish Pete provided, his guitar gave Yoakam\u2019s songs more raw intensity than anything on those 1981 sessions.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=68-70}}}}\n \n''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' originally appeared as a six-track 12\u201d EP version released in 1984 through a tiny independent label Oak Records.  In the notes to the four-disc ''Reprise Please Baby'' box set, Yoakam explained his musical dynamic like this: \u201cYou combine drummers with mountain people, and you\u2019ve got hillbilly music.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing: [[Bill Monroe]] with drums.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=71}}  Regarding the recordings, Anderson later commented that he was particularly concerned with \u201cmaking it cohesive in terms of intros, outros, and solos, that was done on that record, every song.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=72}}  The EP\u2019s success led to Yoakam being signed by Warner Bros. and releasing the same EP with four additional tracks and nearly identical packaging, making him one of the few artists whose major-label debut carried the note that it contained previously released material.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=75}}  \n\n==Composition==\nYoakam composed six of the album\u2019s ten songs, including the title track.  The song, with Anderson's [[Don Rich]]-influenced guitar style, walks the Buck Owens line until the line extends to Yoakam, and Yoakam's street poetry is both poignant and profound, built into a barroom anthem.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/los-lobos-p99039/biography|title=Los Lobos - Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>  According to Don McLeese\u2019s book ''Dwight Yoakam: A Thousand Miles from Nowhere'', it wasn\u2019t until the expansion into the Reprise LP that the singer was inspired to write the song \u201cGuitars, Cadillacs,\u201d with the \u201cand hillbilly music\u201d replacing the \u201cetceteras\u201d that appeared on the original EP cover, and the executives at Warner Bros. balked, fearing that the Kentucky-born artist\u2019s evocation of what the label considered trailer trash \"was like waving a rebel flag at the possibility of mainstream success.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=13}}  [[Steve Earle]], who rose to fame around the same time as Yoakam and included a song he wrote called \"Hillbilly Highway\" on his 1986 breakout album ''Guitar Town'', later observed, \"What we had in common is that we use the term 'hillbilly,' which pissed [[George Jones]] off.  He said one time, 'We spent all these years trying not to be called hillbillies, and Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle fucked it up in one day.'\"{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=75}} McLeese writes:\n\n{{quote|The \u201chillbilly\u201d tag was something that country had made a concerted effort to ditch, from the countrypolitan sophistication of [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Billy Sherrill]] productions through the slick suburbanization of ''Urban Cowboy''.  And here was this punk upstart, tracking manure all over the split-level home that country music had built for itself, reminding listeners of the music\u2019s outhouse era.  \u201cThey asked Pete if he could get me to change it, take the hillbilly out,\u201d says Yoakam.  \u201cAnd Pete knew better.  He said, \u201cNo way.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=75-76}}}}  \n\nOther songs, such as the \u201cstone country\u201d barroom lament \u201cIt Won\u2019t Hurt\u201d and the heartfelt ballad \u201cSouth of Cincinnati,\u201d display Yoakam\u2019s remarkable depth and understanding of country songwriting and storytelling, with the latter putting \u201can interesting twist on the songwriter\u2019s dual heritage in urban [[Ohio]] and rural [[Kentucky]]\u2026one that evokes the palpable change that occurs below the Mason-Dixon line, \u2018south of Cincinnati, down where the dogwood trees grow.\u2019\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=73}}  \u201cTwenty Years\u201d tells the vindictive tale of Henry, a man whose life is ruined after the woman he crossed lies in a district court, framing him for a crime he did not commit. (\"Tried to warn you, henry, not to cross her/Tried to tell you about her vengeful ways...\")  The bluegrass-influenced \u201cMiner\u2019s Prayer\u201d also looks to Kentucky, an acoustic number powered by dobro (courtesy of David Mansfield), flat-picked guitar, and Yoakam's singing of his grandfather and generations like him who lived and died in the mines of Kentucky, which AllMusic critic Thom Jurek describes as \u201cBill Monroe meets [[Ralph Stanley]] meets [[Bob Dylan]].\u201d<ref name=Allmusic/>  (Yoakam would later record the song with Stanley.)  Another Yoakam original, the prideful \u201cBury Me,\u201d had been demoed in 1981 and was rerecorded as a duet with [[Lone Justice]] vocalist [[Maria McKee]].  Yoakam later told ''Rolling Stone'' the song was \"basically a bluegrass in hiding.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/title=Dwight Yoakam on New Bluegrass Album, Prince and Musical Rebellion|last=Murray|first=Nick|date=September 2016|work=rollingstone.com|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter signing with [[Reprise]], Yoakam and Anderson added four additional cuts to the original EP, the most significant being a cover of [[Johnny Horton]]\u2019s 1956 hit \u201c[[Honky Tonk Man]],\u201d which would kick off the major label LP and spend six months on the country charts, peaking at #3.  Along with being his first hit, Yoakam\u2019s \u201cHonky Tonk Man\u201d has the unique bragging rights of being the very first country-music video ever played on [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/title=Flashback: Dwight Yoakam Bridges Genres, Generations With Wild \u2018Guitars\u2019|last=Hodge|first=Will|date=August 2016|work=rollingstone.com|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>  The two other cover songs on the album, [[Harlan Howard]]\u2019s \u201c[[Heartaches by the Number]],\u201d originally made famous by [[Ray Price]], and [[June Carter]]\u2019s \u201c[[Ring of Fire]],\u201d the Johnny Cash classic, remained faithful to the spirit of country music but sounded brand new at the same time, placing Yoakam at the vanguard of what became known as the \u201cNew Traditionalist\u201d movement alongside he likes of [[Randy Travis]] and Steve Earle.  As one writer noted about \u201cHeartaches by the Number,\u201d \u201cBecause of Ed Black's steel playing, Brantley Kearns' fiddle, and Anderson's guitar, the accompaniment is stronger and far edgier than the Ray Price version, but from Yoakam's throat comes an entirely different story than Price's. In Price's case the song was a plea; in Yoakam's it's a statement of fact.\u201d<ref name=Allmusic/>  \n\nThe album was re-issued on October 17, 2006, complete with demos from 1981 and tracks recorded live at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] on Los Angeles' [[Sunset Strip]] in 1986.\n\n==Reception==\nThree of the album's tracks rose into the Top 40 of the [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1986. Yoakam's first single was \"Honky Tonk Man\" peaking at No. 3 on the country charts.  The follow-up was the title track at No. 4.  His third single from the album was \"It Won't Hurt,\" which rose to No. 31.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address", "text_new": "'''Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address''' was a speech delivered by [[Pope Pius XII]] over [[Vatican Radio]] on [[Christmas]] 1942. It is notable for its denunciation of the extermination of people on the basis of race, and followed the commencement of the Nazi ''[[Final Solution]]'' program to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The significance of the denunciation is a matter of scholarly debate.\n\n==Background==\nThe 1942 Christmas Address by Pope Pius XII was made shortly after the war had turned decisively against [[Nazi Germany]]. Hitler had broken his alliance with [[Stalin]] and advanced into the Soviet Union, although his army [[Battle of Stalingrad|in Stalingrad]] had been surrounded, decimated, starved and was about to surrender, precipitating disaster on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Following decisive victories in North Africa, the Pacific and the air war in Northern Europe, the war had turned in favour of the Allies. From May 1942, the Nazis had commenced their industrialized slaughter of the Jews of Europe \u2013 the ''[[Final Solution]]''.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' : \"World War Two - German-occupied Europe\"</ref> The brutalization of the Catholic Church in Poland had been underway for three years.\n\nThe Catholic Church had offered condemnations of Nazi racism since the earliest days of the Nazi movement. The 1942 Christmas address is significant for the light it throws on the ongoing scholarly debate around the war time policies of Pius XII in response to what would later be termed [[The Holocaust]] (the systematic murder of Europe's Jews by the Nazis). Pius' cautious approach has been a subject of controversy. According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', his \"strongest statement against genocide was regarded as inadequate by the Allies, though in Germany he was regarded as an Allied sympathizer who had violated his own policy of neutrality\".<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: \"Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars\".</ref> According to concentration camp prisoner, [[Father Jean Bernard]] of Luxembourg, treatment of clergy imprisoned in the [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp]] worsened when Pope Pius or the German bishops were critical of Hitler or the Nazis.<ref>[http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/rychlak/00934.html ''The Priests of Dachau''] by [[Ronald Rychlak]]; InsideCatholic.com; 8 October 2007.</ref>\n\nTwo Popes served through the Nazi period: [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922-1939) and [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). In 1933, Pius signed a [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat with Germany]] \u2013 hoping to protect the rights of Catholics under the Nazi government. The terms of the Treaty were not kept by Hitler. According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'': \"From 1933 to 1936 [Pius XI] wrote several protests against the Third Reich, and his attitude toward fascist Italy changed dramatically after Nazi racial policies were introduced into Italy in 1938.\" Pius XI delivered three papal encyclicals challenging the new totalitarian creeds from a Catholic perspective: against Italian Fascism [[Non abbiamo bisogno|''Non abbiamo bisogno'']] (1931; \"We Do Not Need to Acquaint You\"); against Nazism [[Mit brennender Sorge|''Mit brennender Sorge'']] (1937; \"With Deep Anxiety\") and against atheistic Communism [[Divini redemptoris|''Divini redemptoris'']] (1937; \"Divine Redeemer\"). He also challenged the extremist nationalism of the Action Francaise movement and anti-Semitism in the United States.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica : ''Pius XI''</ref>\n\nPius XI's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli (future Pius XII), made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its \"ideology of race\".<ref name=\"spectator.org\">{{cite web |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027155520/http://www.spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |archivedate=2008-10-27 }}</ref> As Cardinal Pacelli, Pope Pius XII had assisted Pius XI draft the ''Mit Brennender Sorge'' encyclical, a powerful critique of Nazi ideology.

It is notable for its denunciation of the extermination of people on the basis of race, and followed the commencement of the Nazi ''[[Final Solution]]'' program to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The significance of the denunciation is a matter of scholarly debate.\n\n==Background==\nThe 1942 Christmas Address by Pope Pius XII was made shortly after the war had turned decisively against [[Nazi Germany]]. Hitler had broken his alliance with [[Stalin]] and advanced into the Soviet Union, although his army [[Battle of Stalingrad|in Stalingrad]] had been surrounded, decimated, starved and was about to surrender, precipitating disaster on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Following decisive victories in North Africa, the Pacific and the air war in Northern Europe, the war had turned in favour of the Allies. From May 1942, the Nazis had commenced their industrialized slaughter of the Jews of Europe \u2013 the ''[[Final Solution]]''.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' : \"World War Two - German-occupied Europe\"</ref> The brutalization of the Catholic Church in Poland had been underway for three years.\n\nThe Catholic Church had offered condemnations of Nazi racism since the earliest days of the Nazi movement. The 1942 Christmas address is significant for the light it throws on the ongoing scholarly debate around the war time policies of Pius XII in response to what would later be termed [[The Holocaust]] (the systematic murder of Europe's Jews by the Nazis). Pius' cautious approach has been a subject of controversy. According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', his \"strongest statement against genocide was regarded as inadequate by the Allies, though in Germany he was regarded as an Allied sympathizer who had violated his own policy of neutrality\".<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: \"Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars\".</ref> According to concentration camp prisoner, [[Father Jean Bernard]] of Luxembourg, treatment of clergy imprisoned in the [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp]] worsened when Pope Pius or the German bishops were critical of Hitler or the Nazis.<ref>[http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/rychlak/00934.html ''The Priests of Dachau''] by [[Ronald Rychlak]]; InsideCatholic.com; 8 October 2007.</ref>\n\nTwo Popes served through the Nazi period: [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922-1939) and [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). In 1933, Pius signed a [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat with Germany]] \u2013 hoping to protect the rights of Catholics under the Nazi government. The terms of the Treaty were not kept by Hitler. According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'': \"From 1933 to 1936 [Pius XI] wrote several protests against the Third Reich, and his attitude toward fascist Italy changed dramatically after Nazi racial policies were introduced into Italy in 1938.\" Pius XI delivered three papal encyclicals challenging the new totalitarian creeds from a Catholic perspective: against Italian Fascism [[Non abbiamo bisogno|''Non abbiamo bisogno'']] (1931; \"We Do Not Need to Acquaint You\"); against Nazism [[Mit brennender Sorge|''Mit brennender Sorge'']] (1937; \"With Deep Anxiety\") and against atheistic Communism [[Divini redemptoris|''Divini redemptoris'']] (1937; \"Divine Redeemer\").

The ''New York Times'', under the headline \"JEWS' RIGHTS DEFENDED,\" wrote on 14 March 1940: \"The Pontiff, in the burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution, also came to the defense of the Jews in Germany and Poland.\"<ref>[http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope ''Hitler's Pope?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016021235/http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope |date=2013-10-16 }} by Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18.8.06</ref>\n\n==Content==\nThe 1942 Christmas address was 26 pages and over 5000 words long and took more than 45 minutes to deliver.<ref name=\"rr3\"/> The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society.<ref name=\"rr3\"/> According to Rittner and Roth, \"always one to choose words carefully, Pius wrote several drafts before he had crafted exactly what he wanted to say on that particular Christmas Eve\".<ref name=\"rr3\">Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 3.</ref> Phayer wrote that the speech was \"crafted to fit the circumstances as he saw them&mdash;that is to say, he addressed principles and omitted particulars\".<ref name=\"p53\">Phayer, 2008, p. 53.</ref> Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius' death in 2008, the German Pope [[Benedict XVI]] recalled that the Pope's voice had been \"broken by emotion\" as he \"deplored the situation\" with a \"clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20081009_50-pio-xii_en.html Vatican Archive - Homily by Pope Benedict XVI]; 9 October 2008</ref>\n\nThe Pope addressed the issues of racial persecutions in the following terms:\n\n<blockquote>Humanity owes this vow to those hundreds of thousands who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline<ref name=\"p53\"/> [also translated: \"marked down for death or gradual extinction\"]<ref name=\"rr3\"/></blockquote>\n\nRittner and Roth described these as the \"pivotal words that remain one of the key flashpoints in the Holocaust-related controversy that continues to swirl around him\" came near the end of the speech.<ref name=\"rr3\"/> Phayer, Rittner and Roth see it as significant that Pius XII, did not address the perpetrators or victims by name.<ref>Phayer, 2008, pp. 52-53.</ref><ref name=\"rr4\"/> Nor did he mention Jews or antisemitism.<ref name=\"rr4\"/>\n\n== Contemporary reception==\nThe immediate reaction to the speech was generally positive, with the exception of the Nazis and Jewish victims in Poland.<ref name=\"p56\">Phayer, 2008, p. 56.</ref> Diplomatic criticism of the Vatican's \"moral authority\" essentially ceased for an entire year, until the deportations of the Italian Jews began in 1943.<ref>Phayer, 2008, pp. 56-57.</ref> A ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial called Pius XII a \"lonely voice crying out of the silence of a continent\".<ref>''New York Times''. 25 December 1942. \"The Pope's Verdict.\" p. 16.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The editorial's rhetoric mimics another ''New York Times'' editorial about Pius XII's previous Christmas address, which called the pope \"a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas\" in 1941.<ref>''New York Times''. 25 December 1941. \"The Pope's Message.\" p. 24.</ref>|group=\"n\"}} Phayer's survey of global news sources notes that every paper that covered the speech did so in a positive light, although none of them considered it front-page news.<ref name=\"p58\">Phayer, 2008, p. 58.</ref> Tittmann pressured Pius XII in their diplomatic meetings to go further in his public statements, but privately wired the State Department that \"taken as a whole, the message may be regarded as an arraignment of totalitarianism.

Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin agreed that the address referred to Jews, but considered it not specific enough.<ref name=\"p58\"/> Catholic Poles believed that the address referred to them alone and wished that the pope had identified the Germans as the perpetrators.<ref>Phayer, 2008, pp. 58-59.</ref> The [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London remained dissatisfied with the address, wishing for a \"more trenchant papal condemnation\" that named the perpetrators.<ref name=\"p63\">Phayer, 2008, p. 63.</ref>\n\nThe German government expressed displeasure at the Christmas address and boycotted the pope's [[Christmas eve]] liturgy.<ref name=\"p63\"/> According to [[Pinchas Lapide]]'s ''[[Three Popes and the Jews]]'', on 27 December 1942 the department [[Prague]] of the [[RSHA]] reported the following about the Christmas broadcast that \"The Pope has repudiated the National-Socialist New European Order.... He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.\"<ref>Lapide, 1980, p. 137.</ref> However, Phayer claims he attempted to assuage the German ambassador, [[Diego von Bergen]], by pulling him aside and assuring him that his remarks were intended for the Soviets and Stalin rather than the Germans.<ref name=\"p63\"/>\n\nPhayer argues that contemporaries and scholars have viewed the speech differently because \"we know that the pope would not take up the matter again, but contemporaries did not know that this would be the case.
