''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]).

This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to a degree even greater than that of the [ famous ] ''Alraune'' or [[Mandragora]], such that one can often distinguish clearly in its form a head, arms and legs; the which fact has led to its being given the most apposite name of ''Muzhik koren'' [ \u041c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d ] or \"Man root\" by the Russians. The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty and sometimes as many as a hundred flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give yet not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely sulphur-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most ravishing aspect. The young [[Evenk|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant.

Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are still existing struggles and conflicts that need to be addressed within the country.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rolling Stone|title=Julian Casablancas Interviews Henry

most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is compromised under the control of capitalist greed.\n\nCasablancas cites some of his most politically influential figures as [[Oliver Stone]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Howard Zinn]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He notes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his favorite philosopher, whose work, Casablancas claims, held truth as an important standard value.<ref name=\":3\" /> He recognizes [[Paul Robeson]] as someone who used his musical platform to help further his serious political intrigue and as someone who, therefore, serves as a role model for politically engaged musicians.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCasablancas has been a guest on ''[[Redacted Tonight]]'', as well as included its host, Lee Camp, as an opener for a Voidz show in Houston, Texas in October 2018.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCasablancas endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and performed with his band at a rally in the

There was a legend that he had miraculously assisted [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]; also that [[Richard the Lionheart]] had placed himself under his protection.<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/386/mode/2up p. 387]</ref>\nAccording to legend, the crusaders received miraculous help at the [[siege of Antioch]] on 28 June 1098 from a great army on white horses, clothed in white and bearing white banners, led by St George, St Demetrius, and St Mercurius. However, there was no association of the red cross with St George before the end of the crusades.<ref>Perrin, ''British Flags'' (1922), [https://archive.org/stream/britishflagsthei00perrrich#page/20/mode/2up p. 20]: \"they imagined that they had seen a great army on white horses, clothed in white and bearing white banners in their hands, issue from the neighbouring mountains and come to their assistance. The leaders of this ghostly army, recognised by their names written on their banners, were St George, Saint Demetrius, and St Mercurius. If at this time the red cross had become the distinctive sign of St George one or other of these writers would surely have mentioned it, but all agree that the banners were white.\"</ref>\n\nThe ''red'' cross in particular was associated with the [[Knights Templar]], from the time of the [[Second Crusade]] (1145),<ref>Barber, ''The New Knighthood'', p. 66: \"According to William of Tyre it was under Eugenius III that the Templars received the right to wear the characteristic red cross upon their tunics, symbolising their willingness to suffer martyrdom in the defence of the Holy Land.\" (WT, 12.7, p. 554.

A [[:File:Affreschi cripta santa maria1.JPG|crusader-era fresco]] in the crypt of [[Trani cathedral]] shows Saint George wearing a white cross on a red surcoat. The white-on-red version was chosen as the ''Reichsbanner'' (\"imperial banner\") by the German crusaders in the 12th century, and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] used it in his European campaigns of the 1250s after he had returned from the crusades. It continued to be used as the ''Reichssturmfahne'' (\"imperial war flag\") of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], eventually giving rise to the [[flag of Savoy]] and the present-day flags of [[flag of Switzerland|Switzerland]] and [[flag of Denmark|Denmark]]).\n\nA ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of St George and the dragon. An illumination{{clarify|date=January 2018}} of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Janua\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nThe cross ceased to be a symbol directly associated with the \"taking of the cross\", the resolve to fight in a crusade, after the failure of the crusades in the 14th century. With the development of systematic [[heraldry]], there was great demand for variations of the cross symbol and associated terminology. [[Juliana Berners]] reports that there were ''Crossis innumerabull born dayli''.

The English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the Doge of Genoa for this privilege.</blockquote>\n \nThe red cross was introduced to England by the late 13th century, but not as a flag, and not at the time associated with Saint George. It was worn by English soldiers as an identification from the early years of the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1270s),<ref>\"I have been unable to find any solid ground for the common belief that the cross of St George was introduced as the national emblem of England by Richard I, and am of opinion that it did not begin to attain that position until the first years of the reign of Edward I.\" Perrin, ''British Flags'', 1922, [https://archive.org/stream/britishflagsthei00perrrich#page/n15/mode/2up p. 15]</ref><ref>Perrin, ''British Flags'', 1922, [https://archive.org/stream/britishflagsthei00perrrich#page/20/mode/2up p. 20].</ref> and perhaps originated a few years earlier, in the [[Second Barons' War]] (specifically in the [[Battle of Evesham]] of 1265, during which, according to chronicler [[William Rishanger]], [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montford]] observed that the king had taken from him the idea of having his soldiers marked with a cross).<ref>\"[W]hen Montfort saw the advance of the royal troops [wearing a red cross as their distinguishing mark], he exclaimed that 'They have not learned that for themselves, but were taught it by me.{{'\"}} M.

The flag was initially for maritime display, later restricted to the King's ships. Afterwards, the Saint George flag remained the flag of England for other purposes until the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. At the union, the first [[Union Flag]] became official for all purposes in the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].\nFrom this time, the Saint Georges Cross came to be seen as a symbol of [[England and Wales]] when used alongside symbols for Scotland or Ireland; so in the [[flags of the Commonwealth of England]] during 1649 to 1660.\n\nThe flag of Saint George is also the rank flag of an [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|Admiral]] in the [[Royal Navy]], and civilian craft are forbidden to fly it.

There was a legend that he had miraculously assisted [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]; also that [[Richard the Lionheart]] had placed himself under his protection.<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/386/mode/2up p. 387]</ref>\nAccording to legend, the crusaders received miraculous help at the [[siege of Antioch]] on 28 June 1098 from a great army on white horses, clothed in white and bearing white banners, led by St George, St Demetrius, and St Mercurius. However, there was no association of the red cross with St George before the end of the crusades.<ref>Perrin, ''British Flags'' (1922), [https://archive.org/stream/britishflagsthei00perrrich#page/20/mode/2up p. 20]: \"they imagined that they had seen a great army on white horses, clothed in white and bearing white banners in their hands, issue from the neighbouring mountains and come to their assistance. The leaders of this ghostly army, recognised by their names written on their banners, were St George, Saint Demetrius, and St Mercurius. If at this time the red cross had become the distinctive sign of St George one or other of these writers would surely have mentioned it, but all agree that the banners were white.\"</ref>\n\nThe ''red'' cross in particular was associated with the [[Knights Templar]], from the time of the [[Second Crusade]] (1145),<ref>Barber, ''The New Knighthood'', p. 66: \"According to William of Tyre it was under Eugenius III that the Templars received the right to wear the characteristic red cross upon their tunics, symbolising their willingness to suffer martyrdom in the defence of the Holy Land.\" (WT, 12.7, p. 554. James of Vitry, 'Historia Hierosolimatana', ed. J. ars, ''Gesta Dei per Francos'', vol I (ii), Hanover, 1611, p. 1083, interprets this as a sign of martyrdom.)</ref>\nbut in 1188 red and white crosses were chosen to identify the French and English troops in the \"Kings' Crusade\" of [[Philip II of France]] and [[Henry II of England]], respectively. \nTogether with the [[Jerusalem Cross]], the plain red-on-white became a recognizable symbol of the crusader from about 1190, and in the 13th century it came to be used as a standard or emblem by numerous leaders or polities who wanted to associate themselves with the crusades.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} \nThe red-on-white combination was chosen by [[coat of arms of Aragon|Aragon]], among others. \nSaint George was depicted as a crusader knight during this time, but the red cross had no particular association with him. A [[:File:Affreschi cripta santa maria1.JPG|crusader-era fresco]] in the crypt of [[Trani cathedral]] shows Saint George wearing a white cross on a red surcoat. The white-on-red version was chosen as the ''Reichsbanner'' (\"imperial banner\") by the German crusaders in the 12th century, and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] used it in his European campaigns of the 1250s after he had returned from the crusades. It continued to be used as the ''Reichssturmfahne'' (\"imperial war flag\") of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], eventually giving rise to the [[flag of Savoy]] and the present-day flags of [[flag of Switzerland|Switzerland]] and [[flag of Denmark|Denmark]]).\n\nA ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of St George and the dragon. An illumination{{clarify|date=January 2018}} of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Janua\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nThe cross ceased to be a symbol directly associated with the \"taking of the cross\", the resolve to fight in a crusade, after the failure of the crusades in the 14th century. With the development of systematic [[heraldry]], there was great demand for variations of the cross symbol and associated terminology. [[Juliana Berners]] reports that there were ''Crossis innumerabull born dayli''.

This idea can be traced to the Victorian era, Perrin (1922) refers to it as a \"common belief\", and it is still popularly repeated today even though it cannot be substantiated as historical.\n\nOn the origins of the flag and its connection to the Genoese flag the Duke of Kent remarked in 1992:\n\n<blockquote>The St. George's flag, a red cross on a white field, was adopted by England and the City of London in 1190 for their ships entering the Mediterranean to benefit from the protection of the Genoese fleet. The English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the Doge of Genoa for this privilege.</blockquote>\n \nThe red cross was introduced to England by the late 13th century, but not as a flag, and not at the time associated with Saint George. It was worn by English soldiers as an identification from the early years of the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1270s),<ref>\"I have been unable to find any solid ground for the common belief that the cross of St George was introduced as the national emblem of England by Richard I, and am of opinion that it did not begin to attain that position until the first years of the reign of Edward I.\" Perrin, ''British Flags'', 1922, [https://archive.org/stream/britishflagsthei00perrrich#page/n15/mode/2up p. 15]</ref><ref>Perrin, ''British Flags'', 1922, [https://archive.org/stream/britishflagsthei00perrrich#page/20/mode/2up p. 20].</ref> and perhaps originated a few years earlier, in the [[Second Barons' War]] (specifically in the [[Battle of Evesham]] of 1265, during which, according to chronicler [[William Rishanger]], [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montford]] observed that the king had taken from him the idea of having his soldiers marked with a cross).<ref>\"[W]hen Montfort saw the advance of the royal troops [wearing a red cross as their distinguishing mark], he exclaimed that 'They have not learned that for themselves, but were taught it by me.{{'\"}} M.

From 1348 and throughout the 15th century, the Saint George's Cross was shown in the hoist of the [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standards]] of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] kings of England.\n\n=== Flag ===\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|[[Flag of England]]]] [[File:Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg|thumb|[[Union Jack]]]][[File:Flag of Georgia.svg|thumb|The [[Flag of Georgia (country)|flag of Georgia]] with Saint George cross in middle]] [[File:Flag of Barcelona.svg|thumb|right|The [[flag of Barcelona]]]]\nA [[Flag of the United Kingdom|combined British flag]] was created in 1606 (after the [[personal union|dynastic union]] of England and [[Scotland]] in 1603, the so-called \"[[Union of the Crowns]]\") by combining Saint George's Cross with the [[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]] (the [[flag of Scotland]]). The flag was initially for maritime display, later restricted to the King's ships. Afterwards, the Saint George flag remained the flag of England for other purposes until the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. At the union, the first [[Union Flag]] became official for all purposes in the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].\nFrom this time, the Saint Georges Cross came to be seen as a symbol of [[England and Wales]] when used alongside symbols for Scotland or Ireland; so in the [[flags of the Commonwealth of England]] during 1649 to 1660.\n\nThe flag of Saint George is also the rank flag of an [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|Admiral]] in the [[Royal Navy]], and civilian craft are forbidden to fly it. However, surviving [[little ships of Dunkirk]], which participated in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] during [[World War II]], are allowed to fly it as a [[jack (flag)|jack]].

The city of Nanaimo in British Columbia also uses a Saint George's Cross on its flag and arms with a ship and pieces of coal, its former main export.\n\nThree Canadian provinces and one territory use the Saint George's Cross on their coats of arms: [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]] and [[Yukon]], again reflecting England's influence in Canada.\n\nThe state badge of the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] features Saint George's cross with a golden lion passant guardant in the centre of the cross and a golden eight pointed star on each of the cross limbs.\n\nThe flag used by the British [[Royal Navy]] (the [[White Ensign]]) is consisting of the Saint George's cross and a Union Flag in the canton.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Will Smith]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Margaret Colin]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[James Rebhorn]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Vivica A. Fox]] and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial race]] of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch an all-out counterattack on July 4&mdash;[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film while answering a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. He and [[Dean Devlin]] decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.\n\nNow considered a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Independence Day'' was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. The film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in [[limited release]] as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[1996 in film|highest-grossing film of 1996]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film ever at the time]]<!-- Peak position only. -->, behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993). The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing]]. A sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, making up the first part of a planned [[Independence Day (franchise)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 2, 1996, an enormous [[mothership]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each with a fifteen-mile radius, that take positions over 36 of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an [[MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius gain access to the [[Oval Office]] and warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore of the attack. Whitmore immediately orders large-scale evacuations of [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], but it is too late; the timer reaches zero, and the saucers fire [[directed-energy weapons|destructive beams]] into the ground, causing massive walls of fire that kill millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as Washington is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.\n\nOn July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their [[military aviation|air forces]] attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters with their own shield as well, which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, an F/A-18 jet pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] squadron [[VMFA-314]] based out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]], survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the [[Grand Canyon]] and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed. Through [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Albert Nimzicki, they have learned that a faction of the government has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947 when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks, [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invading Okun's mind and killing all the other doctors. It uses Okun's vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore, before launching a [[psychic]] attack against him. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reveals what he saw in the aliens' plans. He says that invaders are like locusts; their whole civilization travels from one planet to the next, stripping them of all their natural resources. The President reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above [[Houston]], but the saucer remains intact. Meanwhile, Steven's fianc\u00e9e Jasmine and her son survive the destruction of Los Angeles, and use an abandoned service truck to rescue other survivors, in the process finding the injured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], Marilyn, whose helicopter crashed during the initial attack. Though the group is rescued by Steven and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies of the severity of her wounds shortly after being reunited with her family.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their shields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a [[computer virus|virus]] into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through [[Morse code]] to organize a united counter-offense against the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space and entering the alien invaders' [[mother ship]], Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, nullifying the aliens' [[communications system]] and reinforcements, before the malware filtered into the alien ships above Earth. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to successfully fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As it prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile jams, he [[kamikaze|rams]] his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing the entire ship to [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]], destroying it. Human [[military]] forces around the world are notified of the alien ships' critical point and successfully destroy the others. As humanity is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership exploding, resembling a [[fireworks]] display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast listing, as shown in the film's end credits.

A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like ''Stargate'' if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities.

A second unit gathered plate shots and [[establishing shot]]s of Manhattan, Washington, D.C., an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] community in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], and the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] on the [[Plains of San Agustin]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name= \"Aberly and Engel p. 91\"/> The main crew also filmed in nearby [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey]] before moving to the former [[Kaiser Ventures|Kaiser Steel mill]] in [[Fontana, California]] to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 62.</ref> The production then moved to [[Wendover, Utah]], and [[West Wendover, Nevada]],<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 104.</ref> where the deserts doubled for [[Imperial Valley]], and the [[Wendover Airport]] doubled for the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]] and Area 51 exteriors.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 96.</ref> It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because [[Warner Bros.]] owned the rights to the title ''[[Independence Day (1983 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1983) and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in [[dailies]], the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe production team moved to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the [[chroma key]] technique to make it appear as if an activity was happening on the other side of the glass, but the [[compositing|composited images]] were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 98.</ref> The attacker hangar set contained an attacker [[mockup]] {{convert|65|ft}} wide<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\"/> that took four months to build.<ref name=\"EW\"/> The White House interior sets used had already been built for ''[[The American President]]'' and had previously been used for ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref name=\"ID43\"/> Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe film initially depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,<ref name=\"dvd\"/> and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".<ref>[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00003Q43A \"Independence Day.\"] ''amazon.ca''.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Will Smith]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Margaret Colin]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[James Rebhorn]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Vivica A. Fox]] and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial race]] of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch an all-out counterattack on July 4&mdash;[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film while answering a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. He and [[Dean Devlin]] decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.\n\nNow considered a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Independence Day'' was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. The film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in [[limited release]] as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[1996 in film|highest-grossing film of 1996]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film ever at the time]]<!-- Peak position only. -->, behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993). The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing]]. A sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, making up the first part of a planned [[Independence Day (franchise)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 2, 1996, an enormous [[mothership]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each with a fifteen-mile radius, that take positions over 36 of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an [[MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius gain access to the [[Oval Office]] and warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore of the attack. Whitmore immediately orders large-scale evacuations of [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers fire [[directed-energy weapons|destructive beams]] into the ground, causing massive walls of fire that kill millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as Washington is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.\n\nOn July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their [[military aviation|air forces]] attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters with their own shield as well, which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, an F/A-18 jet pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] squadron [[VMFA-314]] based out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]], survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the [[Grand Canyon]] and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed. Through [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Albert Nimzicki, they have learned that a faction of the government has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks, [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invading Okun's mind and killing all the other doctors. It uses Okun's vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore, before launching a [[psychic]] attack against him. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reveals what he saw in the aliens' plans. He says that invaders are like locusts; their whole civilization travels from one planet to the next, stripping them of all their natural resources. The President reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above [[Houston]], but the saucer remains intact. Meanwhile, Steven's fianc\u00e9e Jasmine and her son survive the destruction of Los Angeles, and use an abandoned service truck to rescue other survivors, in the process finding the injured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], Marilyn, whose helicopter crashed during the initial attack. Though the group is rescued by Steven and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies of the severity of her wounds shortly after being reunited with her family.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their shields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a [[computer virus|virus]] into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through [[Morse code]] to organize a united counter-offense against the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space and entering the alien invaders' [[mother ship]], Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, nullifying the aliens' [[communications system]] and reinforcements, before the malware filtered into the alien ships above Earth. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to successfully fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As it prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile jams, he [[kamikaze|rams]] his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing the entire ship to [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]], destroying it. Human [[military]] forces around the world are notified of the alien ships' critical point, and successfully destroy the others. As humanity is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership exploding, resembling a [[fireworks]] display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast listing, as shown in the film's end credits.

A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like ''Stargate'' if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, \"I think I have an idea for our next film.\"<ref name=\"dvd\"/><ref name=\"ID41\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 8.</ref><ref name=\"EW7\">[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292721,00.html The 1996 Summer Movie Preview: July] ''Entertainment Weekly''. Retrieved July 8, 2008.</ref>\n\nEmmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that \"for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field \u2026[o]r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head.\"<ref name=\"ID42\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 93.</ref> Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy, \"would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance?\"<ref name=\"ID42\"/> The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico,<ref name=\"ID41\" /> and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, [[20th Century Fox]] chairman [[Peter Chernin]] greenlit the screenplay.<ref name=\"EW\"/> Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995.<ref name=\"dvd\"/><ref name=\"ID41\"/> The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's [[Area 51]] references.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\nA then-record 3,000-plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film.<ref name=\"EW7\"/> The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than [[Digimation|computer-generated effects]] in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> Many of these shots were accomplished at [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]] in [[Culver City, California]], where the film's art department, [[motion control photography]] teams, [[pyrotechnics]] team, and model shop were headquartered{{doubtful|date=July 2018}}. The production's model-making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments.<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72.</ref> The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a {{Convert|30|ft|adj=mid}} destroyer model<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 54.</ref> and a version of the mother ship spanning {{convert|12|ft}}.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 121.</ref> City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards.

A second unit gathered plate shots and [[establishing shot]]s of Manhattan, Washington, D.C., an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] community in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], and the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] on the [[Plains of San Agustin]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name= \"Aberly and Engel p. 91\"/> The main crew also filmed in nearby [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey]] before moving to the former [[Kaiser Ventures|Kaiser Steel mill]] in [[Fontana, California]] to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 62.</ref> The production then moved to [[Wendover, Utah]], and [[West Wendover, Nevada]],<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 104.</ref> where the deserts doubled for [[Imperial Valley]], and the [[Wendover Airport]] doubled for the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]] and Area 51 exteriors.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 96.</ref> It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because [[Warner Bros.]] owned the rights to the title ''[[Independence Day (1983 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1983) and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in [[dailies]], the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe production team moved to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the [[chroma key]] technique to make it appear as if activity was happening on the other side of the glass; but the [[compositing|composited images]] were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 98.</ref> The attacker hangar set contained an attacker [[mockup]] {{convert|65|ft}} wide<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\"/> that took four months to build.<ref name=\"EW\"/> The White House interior sets used had already been built for ''[[The American President]]'' and had previously been used for ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref name=\"ID43\"/> Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe film originally depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,<ref name=\"dvd\"/> and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".<ref>[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00003Q43A \"Independence Day.\"] ''amazon.ca''.

These families eventually became the new ruling class of Cornwall (typically speaking Norman French, Breton-Cornish, Latin and eventually English), many becoming involved in the operation of the [[Stannary law|Stannary Parliament]] system, Earldom and eventually the Duchy.<ref>Payton (2004), chapter 5.</ref> The [[Cornish language]] continued to be spoken and it acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from [[Breton language|Breton]].\n\n====Stannary parliaments====\n{{main|Stannary law}}\nThe [[stannary parliament]]s and stannary courts were legislative and legal institutions in Cornwall and in Devon (in the Dartmoor area). The stannary courts administered [[equity (law)|equity]] for the region's tin-miners and tin mining interests, and they were also courts of record for the towns dependent on the mines. The separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the English economy during the Middle Ages. Special laws for tin miners pre-date written legal codes in Britain, and ancient traditions exempted everyone connected with tin mining in Cornwall and Devon from any jurisdiction other than the stannary courts in all but the most exceptional circumstances.\n\n====Piracy and smuggling====\nCornish piracy was active during the Elizabethan era on the west coast of Britain.<ref name=\"Matthew 1924\">{{cite book|last1=Matthew|first1=David|title=The Cornish and Welsh Pirates in the Reign of Elizabeth|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=The English Historical Review |volume=39 |issue=155 |date=July 1924 |pages=337\u2013348}}</ref> Cornwall is well known for its [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wreckers]] who preyed on ships passing Cornwall's rocky coastline.

The See of Cornwall continued until much later: Bishop [[Conan of Cornwall|Conan]] was apparently in place previously, but he was re-consecrated in 931 AD by [[Athelstan]]. However, it is unclear whether he was the sole Bishop for Cornwall or the leading Bishop in the area. The situation in Cornwall may have been somewhat similar to Wales where each major religious house corresponded to a [[cantref]] (this has the same meaning as Cornish [[Constitutional status of Cornwall#Cornish \"shires\"|keverang]]) both being under the supervision of a Bishop.<ref>Charles-Edwards, T.

However, it can be inferred from the districts included at this period that the minimum number would be three: Triggshire; Wivelshire; and the remaining area. Penwith, Kerrier, Pydar and Powder meet at a central point ([[Scorrier]]) which some have believed indicates a fourfold division imposed by Athelstan on a sub-kingdom.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe whole of Cornwall was in this period in the [[List of Archdeacons of Cornwall|Archdeaconry of Cornwall]] within the Diocese of Exeter. From 1267 the archdeacons had a house at [[Glasney College|Glasney]] near Penryn.

Chichester: Phillimore; p. 147</ref> In 1548 the college at [[Glasney College|Glasney]], a centre of learning and study established by the Bishop of Exeter, had been closed and looted (many manuscripts and documents were destroyed) which aroused resentment among the Cornish. They, among other things, objected to the English language [[Book of Common Prayer]], protesting that the English language was still unknown to many at the time. The Prayer Book Rebellion was a cultural and social disaster for Cornwall; the reprisals taken by the forces of the Crown have been estimated to account for 10\u201311% of the civilian population of Cornwall. Culturally speaking, it saw the beginning of the slow decline of the [[Cornish language]].\n\nFrom that time Christianity in Cornwall was in the main within the Church of England and subject to the national events which affected it in the next century and a half. Roman Catholicism never became extinct, though openly practised by very few; there were some converts to Puritanism, Anabaptism and Quakerism in certain areas though they suffered intermittent persecution which more or less came to an end in the reign of William and Mary. During the 18th century Cornish Anglicanism was very much in the same state as Anglicanism in most of England.

The coastline is composed mainly of [[resistance (geology)|resistant]] rocks that give rise in many places to tall cliffs. Cornwall has a border with only one other county, [[Devon]], which is formed almost entirely by the [[River Tamar]], and the remainder (to the north) by the [[Marsland Valley]].\n\n===Coastal areas===\nThe north and south coasts have different characteristics. The north coast on the [[Celtic Sea]], part of the Atlantic Ocean, is more exposed and therefore has a wilder nature. The prosaically named ''High Cliff'', between [[Boscastle]] and [[St Gennys]], is the highest sheer-drop cliff in Cornwall at {{convert|223|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/main/sections/index.cfm?fsa=dspSectionDetail&w_id=147 |title=The Official Guide to the South West Coast Path |publisher=Southwestcoastpath.com |accessdate=25 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611114118/http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/main/sections/index.cfm?fsa=dspSectionDetail&w_id=147 |archivedate=11 June 2011  }}</ref> However, there are also many extensive stretches of fine golden sand which form the beaches that are so important to the tourist industry, such as those at [[Bude]], [[Polzeath]], [[Watergate Bay]], [[Perranporth]], [[Porthtowan]], [[Fistral Beach]], [[Newquay]], [[St Agnes, Cornwall|St Agnes]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], and on the south coast [[Gyllyngvase]] beach in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and the large beach at [[Praa Sands]] further to the south-west. There are two river estuaries on the north coast: [[Hayle Estuary]] and the estuary of the [[River Camel]], which provides [[Padstow]] and [[Rock, Cornwall|Rock]] with a safe harbour. The seaside town of [[Newlyn]] is a popular holiday destination, as it is one of the last remaining traditional Cornish fishing ports, with views reaching over Mount's Bay.\n\n[[File:St-Michael Mount.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Michael's Mount]] in Marazion]]\nThe south coast, dubbed the \"Cornish Riviera\", is more sheltered and there are several broad estuaries offering safe anchorages, such as at Falmouth and [[Fowey]]. Beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle, interspersed with rocky sections of [[wave-cut platform]]. Also on the south coast, the picturesque fishing village of [[Polperro]], at the mouth of the Pol River, and the fishing port of [[Looe]] on the [[River Looe]] are both popular with tourists.\n\n===Inland areas===\nThe interior of the county consists of a roughly east\u2013west spine of infertile and exposed upland, with a series of [[granite]] intrusions, such as [[Bodmin Moor]], which contains the highest land within Cornwall. From east to west, and with approximately descending altitude, these are Bodmin Moor, [[Hensbarrow]] north of [[St Austell]], [[Carnmenellis]] to the south of [[Camborne]], and the [[Penwith]] or [[Land's End]] peninsula. These intrusions are the central part of the granite outcrops that form the exposed parts of the [[Cornubian batholith]] of south-west Britain, which also includes [[Dartmoor]] to the east in Devon and the [[Isles of Scilly]] to the west, the latter now being partially submerged.\n\n[[File:Porthcurno beach.jpg|thumb|Cornwall is known for its beaches (Porthcurno beach illustrated) and rugged coastline]]\nThe intrusion of the granite into the surrounding [[sedimentary]] rocks gave rise to extensive [[metamorphism]] and mineralisation, and this led to Cornwall being one of the most important mining areas in Europe until the early 20th century. It is thought [[tin]] was mined here as early as the [[Bronze Age]], and copper, lead, [[zinc]] and silver have all been [[Mining in Cornwall|mined in Cornwall]]. Alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of [[Kaolinite|China Clay]], especially in the area to the north of St Austell, and the extraction of this remains an important industry.\n\nThe uplands are surrounded by more fertile, mainly [[pasture|pastoral]] farmland. Near the south coast, deep wooded valleys provide sheltered conditions for flora that like shade and a moist, mild climate. These areas lie mainly on [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]] and [[slate]]. The north east of Cornwall lies on [[Carboniferous]] rocks known as the [[Culm Measures]]. In places these have been subjected to severe folding, as can be seen on the north coast near [[Crackington Haven]] and in several other locations.\n\n===Lizard Peninsula===\n{{Main|Lizard complex}}\n\nThe [[Geology of Lizard, Cornwall|geology of the Lizard peninsula]] is unusual, in that it is mainland Britain's only example of an [[ophiolite]], a section of oceanic crust now found on land.{{efn|Britain's only other example of an ophiolite, the Shetland ophiolite, is older, and linked to the Grampian [[Orogeny]].}} Much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red [[Precambrian]] [[serpentinite]], which forms spectacular cliffs, notably at [[Kynance Cove]], and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops. This [[ultramafic rock]] also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula. This is home to rare plants, such as the [[Erica vagans|Cornish Heath]], which has been adopted as the [[county flower]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5430 |title=The Cornish Heath \u2013 County Flower |accessdate=5 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080930154036/http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5430 |archivedate=30 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Hills and high points===\n{{main|List of hills of Cornwall}}\n\n==Settlements and transport==\n{{See also|List of settlements in Cornwall by population|Transport in Cornwall}}\n[[File:Truro stmarysst.jpg|thumb|right|[[Truro]], Cornwall's administrative centre and only city.]]\nCornwall's only city, and the home of the [[Cornwall Council|council headquarters]], is [[Truro]]. Nearby [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] is notable as a port. [[St Just in Penwith]] is the westernmost town in England, though the same claim has been made for [[Penzance]], which is larger. [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] and [[Padstow]] are today small vessel ports with a major tourism and leisure sector in their economies. [[Newquay]] on the north coast is another major urban settlement which is known for its beaches and is a popular surfing destination, as is [[Bude]] further north, but Newquay is now also becoming important for its aviation-related industries. [[Camborne]] is the county's largest town and more populous than the capital Truro. Together with the neighbouring town of [[Redruth]], it forms the largest urban area in Cornwall, and both towns were significant as centres of the global tin mining industry in the 19th century; nearby copper mines were also very productive during that period. [[St Austell]] is also larger than Truro and was the centre of the [[kaolin|china clay]] industry in Cornwall. Until four [[St Austell parishes|new parishes]] were created for the St Austell area on 1 April 2009 St Austell was the largest settlement in Cornwall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/7766589.stm|title=Town and parishes to get councils|work=BBC News website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 December 2008 | date=5 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nCornwall borders the county of [[Devon]] at the River Tamar. Major roads between Cornwall and the rest of Great Britain are the [[A38 road|A38]] which crosses the Tamar at [[Plymouth]] via the [[Tamar Bridge]] and the town of [[Saltash]], the [[A39 road]] (Atlantic Highway) from [[Barnstaple]], passing through [[North Cornwall]] to end in Falmouth, and the [[A30 road|A30]] which crosses the border south of [[Launceston, England|Launceston]], crosses Bodmin Moor and connects Bodmin and Truro. [[Torpoint Ferry]] links Plymouth with [[Torpoint]] on the opposite side of the [[Hamoaze]]. A rail bridge, the [[Royal Albert Bridge]] built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1859), provides the only other land transport link. The city of Plymouth, a large urban centre in south west Devon, is an important location for services such as hospitals, department stores, road and rail transport, and cultural venues, particularly for people living in east Cornwall.\n\n[[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]], across the Bristol Channel, have at some times in the past been connected to Cornwall by ferry, but these do not operate now.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.severnlink.com/ |title=Fast Ferries connecting Wales & the South West \u2013 Severn Link, Fast Ferries Connecting Wales and the South West |publisher=Severnlink.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106161135/http://www.severnlink.com/ |archive-date=6 November 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Isles of Scilly]] are served by ferry (from Penzance) and by aeroplane, having its own airport: [[St Mary's Airport (Isles of Scilly)|St Mary's Airport]].

The stannary courts administered [[equity (law)|equity]] for the region's tin-miners and tin mining interests, and they were also courts of record for the towns dependent on the mines. The separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the English economy during the Middle Ages.

The See of Cornwall continued until much later: Bishop [[Conan of Cornwall|Conan]] was apparently in place previously, but he was re-consecrated in 931 AD by [[Athelstan]]. However, it is unclear whether he was the sole Bishop for Cornwall or the leading Bishop in the area. The situation in Cornwall may have been somewhat similar to Wales where each major religious house corresponded to a [[cantref]] (this has the same meaning as Cornish [[Constitutional status of Cornwall#Cornish \"shires\"|keverang]]) both being under the supervision of a Bishop.<ref>Charles-Edwards, T.

However, it can be inferred from the districts included at this period that the minimum number would be three: Triggshire; Wivelshire; and the remaining area. Penwith, Kerrier, Pydar and Powder meet at a central point ([[Scorrier]]) which some have believed indicates a fourfold division imposed by Athelstan on a sub-kingdom.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe whole of Cornwall was in this period in the [[List of Archdeacons of Cornwall|Archdeaconry of Cornwall]] within the Diocese of Exeter. From 1267 the archdeacons had a house at [[Glasney College|Glasney]] near Penryn.

Chichester: Phillimore; p. 147</ref> In 1548 the college at [[Glasney College|Glasney]], a centre of learning and study established by the Bishop of Exeter, had been closed and looted (many manuscripts and documents were destroyed) which aroused resentment among the Cornish. They, among other things, objected to the English language [[Book of Common Prayer]], protesting that the English language was still unknown to many at the time. The Prayer Book Rebellion was a cultural and social disaster for Cornwall; the reprisals taken by the forces of the Crown have been estimated to account for 10\u201311% of the civilian population of Cornwall. Culturally speaking, it saw the beginning of the slow decline of the [[Cornish language]].\n\nFrom that time Christianity in Cornwall was in the main within the Church of England and subject to the national events which affected it in the next century and a half. Roman Catholicism never became extinct, though openly practised by very few; there were some converts to Puritanism, Anabaptism and Quakerism in certain areas though they suffered intermittent persecution which more or less came to an end in the reign of William and Mary. During the 18th century Cornish Anglicanism was very much in the same state as Anglicanism in most of England. Wesleyan Methodist missions began during [[John Wesley]]'s lifetime and had great success over a long period during which Methodism itself divided into a number of sects and established a definite separation from the Church of England.\n\n[[File:Poughill Methodist Church - geograph.org.uk - 207036.jpg|thumb|Poughill Methodist Church]]\n\nFrom the early 19th to the mid-20th century [[Methodism]] was the leading form of Christianity in Cornwall but it is now in decline.<ref>{{cite web |title =Methodism |publisher = Cornish-Mining.org.uk |url = http://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/story/religion.htm |accessdate = 11 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>Shaw, Thomas (1967) ''A History of Cornish Methodism''.

There are two river estuaries on the north coast: [[Hayle Estuary]] and the estuary of the [[River Camel]], which provides [[Padstow]] and [[Rock, Cornwall|Rock]] with a safe harbour. The seaside town of [[Newlyn]] is a popular holiday destination, as it is one of the last remaining traditional Cornish fishing ports, with views reaching over Mount's Bay.\n\n[[File:St-Michael Mount.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Michael's Mount]] in Marazion]]\nThe south coast, dubbed the \"Cornish Riviera\", is more sheltered and there are several broad estuaries offering safe anchorages, such as at Falmouth and [[Fowey]].

Also on the south coast, the picturesque fishing village of [[Polperro]], at the mouth of the Pol River, and the fishing port of [[Looe]] on the [[River Looe]] are both popular with tourists.\n\n===Inland areas===\nThe interior of the county consists of a roughly east\u2013west spine of infertile and exposed upland, with a series of [[granite]] intrusions, such as [[Bodmin Moor]], which contains the highest land within Cornwall.

These intrusions are the central part of the granite outcrops that form the exposed parts of the [[Cornubian batholith]] of south-west Britain, which also includes [[Dartmoor]] to the east in Devon and the [[Isles of Scilly]] to the west, the latter now being partially submerged.\n\n[[File:Porthcurno beach.jpg|thumb|Cornwall is known for its beaches (Porthcurno beach illustrated) and rugged coastline]]\nThe intrusion of the granite into the surrounding [[sedimentary]] rocks gave rise to extensive [[metamorphism]] and mineralisation, and this led to Cornwall being one of the most important mining areas in Europe until the early 20th century. It is thought [[tin]] was mined here as early as the [[Bronze Age]], and copper, lead, [[zinc]] and silver have all been [[Mining in Cornwall|mined in Cornwall]]. Alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of [[Kaolinite|China Clay]], especially in the area to the north of St Austell, and the extraction of this remains an important industry.\n\nThe uplands are surrounded by more fertile, mainly [[pasture|pastoral]] farmland. Near the south coast, deep wooded valleys provide sheltered conditions for flora that like shade and a moist, mild climate. These areas lie mainly on [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]] and [[slate]]. The north east of Cornwall lies on [[Carboniferous]] rocks known as the [[Culm Measures]]. In places these have been subjected to severe folding, as can be seen on the north coast near [[Crackington Haven]] and in several other locations.\n\n===Lizard Peninsula===\n{{Main|Lizard complex}}\n\nThe [[Geology of Lizard, Cornwall|geology of the Lizard peninsula]] is unusual, in that it is mainland Britain's only example of an [[ophiolite]], a section of oceanic crust now found on land.{{efn|Britain's only other example of an ophiolite, the Shetland ophiolite, is older, and linked to the Grampian [[Orogeny]].}} Much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red [[Precambrian]] [[serpentinite]], which forms spectacular cliffs, notably at [[Kynance Cove]], and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops. This [[ultramafic rock]] also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula. This is home to rare plants, such as the [[Erica vagans|Cornish Heath]], which has been adopted as the [[county flower]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5430 |title=The Cornish Heath \u2013 County Flower |accessdate=5 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080930154036/http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5430 |archivedate=30 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Hills and high points===\n{{main|List of hills of Cornwall}}\n\n==Settlements and transport==\n{{See also|List of settlements in Cornwall by population|Transport in Cornwall}}\n[[File:Truro stmarysst.jpg|thumb|right|[[Truro]], Cornwall's administrative centre and only city.]]\nCornwall's only city, and the home of the [[Cornwall Council|council headquarters]], is [[Truro]]. Nearby [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] is notable as a port. [[St Just in Penwith]] is the westernmost town in England, though the same claim has been made for [[Penzance]], which is larger. [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] and [[Padstow]] are today small vessel ports with a major tourism and leisure sector in their economies. [[Newquay]] on the north coast is another major urban settlement which is known for its beaches and is a popular surfing destination, as is [[Bude]] further north, but Newquay is now also becoming important for its aviation-related industries. [[Camborne]] is the county's largest town and more populous than the capital Truro. Together with the neighbouring town of [[Redruth]], it forms the largest urban area in Cornwall, and both towns were significant as centres of the global tin mining industry in the 19th century; nearby copper mines were also very productive during that period. [[St Austell]] is also larger than Truro and was the centre of the [[kaolin|china clay]] industry in Cornwall. Until four [[St Austell parishes|new parishes]] were created for the St Austell area on 1 April 2009 St Austell was the largest settlement in Cornwall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/7766589.stm|title=Town and parishes to get councils|work=BBC News website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 December 2008 | date=5 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nCornwall borders the county of [[Devon]] at the River Tamar. Major roads between Cornwall and the rest of Great Britain are the [[A38 road|A38]] which crosses the Tamar at [[Plymouth]] via the [[Tamar Bridge]] and the town of [[Saltash]], the [[A39 road]] (Atlantic Highway) from [[Barnstaple]], passing through [[North Cornwall]] to end in Falmouth, and the [[A30 road|A30]] which crosses the border south of [[Launceston, England|Launceston]], crosses Bodmin Moor and connects Bodmin and Truro. [[Torpoint Ferry]] links Plymouth with [[Torpoint]] on the opposite side of the [[Hamoaze]]. A rail bridge, the [[Royal Albert Bridge]] built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1859), provides the only other land transport link. The city of Plymouth, a large urban centre in south west Devon, is an important location for services such as hospitals, department stores, road and rail transport, and cultural venues, particularly for people living in east Cornwall.\n\n[[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]], across the Bristol Channel, have at some times in the past been connected to Cornwall by ferry, but these do not operate now.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.severnlink.com/ |title=Fast Ferries connecting Wales & the South West \u2013 Severn Link, Fast Ferries Connecting Wales and the South West |publisher=Severnlink.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106161135/http://www.severnlink.com/ |archive-date=6 November 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Isles of Scilly]] are served by ferry (from Penzance) and by aeroplane, having its own airport: [[St Mary's Airport (Isles of Scilly)|St Mary's Airport]].

There are also primary schools in many villages and towns: e.g. [[St Mabyn Church of England Primary School]].\n\nHigher education is provided by [[Falmouth University]], the [[University of Exeter]] (including [[Camborne School of Mines]]), the [[Combined Universities in Cornwall]], Truro College and Penwith College (which combined in 2008 to make [[Truro and Penwith College]]) and Cornwall College.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geography|<!-- Eurasia -->|Europe|<!-- Western Europe -->|<!-- Northern Europe -->||United Kingdom|England|Cornwall}}\n\n* [[Index of Cornwall-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Cornwall]] \u2013 overview of the wide range of topics covered by this subject\n* [[Tamar Valley AONB]]\n\n===Novels set in Cornwall===\n*''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]''\n*''[[Poldark]]''\n*''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book |last = Clegg |first = David |title = Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly: the complete guide |publisher = Matador |location = Leicester |year = 2005 |edition = 2nd |isbn = 1-904744-99-0}}\n* {{cite book\n|last = Halliday |first = Frank Ernest |authorlink = F.
