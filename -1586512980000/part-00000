The dictatorship was established after the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|democratically-elected socialist government]] of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 11 September 1973. During this time, the country was ruled by a [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|military junta]] headed by General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende's presidency to justify its seizure of power. The dictatorship presented its mission as a \"national reconstruction.\" The coup was the result of multiple forces, including pressure from conservative and women\u2019s groups, certain political parties, union strikes and other domestic unrest, as well as international factors. According to an article written by lifelong CIA operative [[Jack Devine]], although it was widely reported that the CIA was directly involved in orchestrating and carrying out the coup, subsequently released sources suggest a much reduced role of the US government.<ref>Jack Devine & Peter Kornbluh, 'Showdown in Santiago: What Really Happened in Chile?', Foreign Affairs 93 (2014), 168-174.</ref>\n\nThe regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent unprecedented in the [[history of Chile]]. Overall, the regime left over 3,000 dead or missing, tortured tens of thousands of prisoners,<ref name=\"BBC-Chile\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |title=Country profile: Chile |work=BBC News |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=31 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114035710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}</ref> and drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1            = Wright\n| first1           = T.C.\n| last2            = O\u00f1ate\n| first2           = R.\n| contribution     = Chilean Diaspora\n| editor-last1     = Ember\n| editor-first1    = M.\n| editor-last2     = Ember\n| editor-first2    = C.R.\n| editor-last3     = Skoggard\n| editor-first3    = I.\n| title            = Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World\n| volume           = II\n| pages            = 57\u201365\n| place            = \n| date = 2005\n| contribution-url = \n}}</ref> The dictatorship's effects on Chilean political and economic life continue to be felt. Two years after its ascension radical [[neoliberal]] economic reforms were implemented, in sharp contrast to Allende's leftist policies, advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the [[Chicago Boys]]. Later, in 1980, the regime replaced the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925]] with a [[Constitution of Chile|new constitution]]. This established a series of provisions that would eventually lead to the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite]] on October 5 of that year.\n\nIn that referendum, the Chilean people denied Pinochet a new mandate, opening the way for the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of democracy in 1990]]. Consequently, democratic presidential elections were held the following year. The military dictatorship ended in 1990 with the election of [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian-Democrat]] candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]]. However, the military remained out of civilian control for several years after the junta itself had lost power.<ref name=AngellPollack1990>{{cite journal |last=Angell |first=Alan |last2=Pollack |first2=Benny |date=1990 |title=The Chilean Elections of 1989 |journal=[[Bulletin of Latin American Research]] |publisher=Society for Latin American Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201323 |doi= 10.2307/3338214|jstor=3338214 }}</ref>\n\n==Rise to power==\n{{main|1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n\nThere has been a large amount of debate over the extent of US government involvement in destabilising the Allende government.<ref>{{Citation|last=Harmer|first=Tanya|chapter=Rebellion|date=2011-10-10|pages=73\u2013106|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807834954|doi=10.5149/9780807869246_harmer.8|title=Allende's Chile and the Inter-American Cold War}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|doi = 10.1163/2468-1733_shafr_sim180020010}}</ref> Recently declassified documents show evidence of communication between the Chilean military and US officials, suggesting covert US involvement in assisting the military\u2019s rise to power.

This was done with support of journalists who \"reported\" the supposed events; in some cases, the fake combats were also staged. The faked combat tactic ameliorated criticism of the regime implicitly putting culpability on the victim. It is thought that the killing of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] leader [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (politician)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]] in 1974 could be an early case of a faked combat. The faked combats reinforced the dictatorship narrative on the existence of an \"internal war\" which it used to justify its existence.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Silva Hidalgo |first=Robinson Humberto |date=2014 |title=Resistencia pol\u00edtica y origen del movimiento social anti dictatorial en Chile (1973\u20131988) |type=Ph.D. |publisher=[[Universitat de Barcelona]] |url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |page=341\u2013349 |language=Spanish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216184935/http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-16 }}</ref> A particular fake combat event, lasting from September 8 to 9 1983, occurred when forces of the CNI lobbed grenades into a house, detonating the structure and killing the two men and a woman who were in the building.

The official story became that the three suspects had caused the explosion themselves by trying to burn and destroy incriminating evidence.

Leigh criticized Pinochet for having joined the coup very late and then pretending to keep all power for himself. In December 1974 Leigh opposed the proposal to name Pinochet president of Chile. Leigh recalls about that moment that, \"Pinochet was furious, he hit the board, broke the glass, injured his hand a little and bled. Then, Merino and Mendoza told me I should sign, because if not the junta would split. I signed.\". Leigh's primary concern was Pinochet's consolidating of the legislative and executive branches of government under the new government. In particular, Pinochet's decision to enact a plebiscite without formally alerting the other junta members.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ensalaco, Mark. 2000. Chile Under Pinochet : Recovering the Truth. Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> Leigh, although a fervent supporter of the regime and hater of marxist ideology, had already taken steps to separate the executive and legislative branches. Pinochet is said to have been angered by Leigh's continued founding of a structure to divide the executive and legislative branches, eventually leading to Pinochet consolidating power and Leigh being dumped from the regime.<ref>Barros, Robert.

MIR assassinated the head of the Army Intelligence school, Lieutenant Roger Vergara, with machine gun fire in the late 1970s.

Domestically, it was the second most powerful institution, behind Pinochet's government. While the Church remained politically neutral, its opposition to the regime came in the form of human rights advocacy and through the social movements that it gave a platform to. It achieved this through the establishment of the Cooperative Committee for Peace in Chile (COPACHI) and Vicariate of Solidarity. COPACHI was founded by [[Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez|Cardinal Raul Silve Henriquez]], Archbishop of Santiago, as an immediate response to the repression of the Pinochet regime. It was apolitical in a spirit of collaboration rather than conflict with the government. Pinochet developed suspicion of COPACHI, leading to its dissolution in late 1975. In response Silva founded the Vicariate in its place. Historian Hugo Fruhling's work highlights the multifaceted nature of Vicaria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corradi |first1=Juan |title=Fear at the Edge, State Terror and Resistance in Latin America |url=https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan |url-access=registration |date=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan/page/121 121\u2013141]}}</ref> Through developments and education programs in the shantytown area of Santiago, the Vicaria had mobilised around 44,000 people to join campaigns by 1979. The Church published a newsletter called ''Solidarity'' published in Chile and abroad, and supplied the public with information through radio stations. Vicaria pursued a legal strategy of defending human rights, not a political strategy to re-democratise Chile.\n\n====Jornadas de Protesta Nacional====\n\nThe Days of National Protest ([[:es:Jornadas de Protesta Nacional|Jornadas de Protesta Nacional]]) were days of civil demonstrations that periodically took place in Chile in the 1980s against the military junta. They were characterized by street demonstrations in the downtown avenues of the city in the mornings, strikes during the day, and barricades and clashes in the periphery of the city throughout the night. The protests were faced with increased government repression from 1984, with the biggest and last protest summoned in July 1986. The protests changed the mentality of many Chileans, strengthening opposition organizations and movements in the 1988 plebiscite.\n\n=== External Opposition ===\n\n==== Solidarity Campaigns & Exiles Movements ====\nThe regime's forced exile of over 200,000 Chileans led to areas of global opposition to the Pinochet government. However, the exiles themselves were not entirely responsible for the international resistance against Pinochet, but rather were able to gain the solidarity of many members of their host countries. Exiles were dispersed across the globe, and to all continents, with different factions of leftist opposition finding refuge in like-minded host countries. For example, the militant revolutionary MIR centring their operations in Havana, Cuba. While the efforts of exiles across the globe in actually militarily or financially supporting the domestic opposition to the junta were limited in their effectiveness, the more important work of the exiles came in their efforts in mobilising support among citizens in their host countries. As such, The Chile Solidarity Campaign (CSC) in the UK was relatively successful at petitioning the labour government. This included lobbying host governments and international organisations such as the United Nations to condemn the abuses of the dictatorship. The overall effect of this was the successful creation of a global solidarity movement.\n\n==Economy and free market reforms==\n[[Image:Chile- el pueblo vencera cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] as a [[concentration camp]] after the coup.]]\n{{Main|Economic history of Chile#1975-81}}\nAfter the military took over the government in 1973, a period of dramatic economic changes began. The Chilean economy was still faltering in the months following the coup. As the military junta itself was not particularly skilled in remedying the persistent economic difficulties, it appointed a group of Chilean economists who had been educated in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]]. Given financial and ideological support from Pinochet, the U.S., and international financial institutions, the [[Chicago Boys]] advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[free market|free-market]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]], and [[Conservatism#Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] policies, in stark contrast to the extensive [[nationalization]] and centrally-planned economic programs supported by Allende.<ref name=\"K.

Remmer 1998 5-55\"/>\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the era can be divided into two periods. The first, from 1975 to 1982, corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. The following period was characterized by new reforms and economic recovery. Some economists argue that the recovery was due to an about-face turnaround of Pinochet's free market policy, since he nationalized many of the same industries that were nationalized under Allende and fired the Chicago Boys from their government posts.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities and the re-privatization of companies that had briefly returned to government control during the 1982\u201383 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent.

In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.'' and in cite 46: ''According to Clar\u00edn, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decisionmakers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''</ref> But the relations remained tense as Argentina invaded the Falklands ([[Operation Rosario]]). Chile along with [[Colombia]], were the only countries in South America to criticize the use of force by Argentina in its war with the UK over the [[Falkland Islands]]. Chile actually helped the United Kingdom during the war. The two countries (Chile and Argentina) finally agreed to papal mediation over the Beagle canal that finally ended in the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] (''Tratado de Paz y Amistad''). Chilean sovereignty over the islands and Argentinian east of the surrounding sea is now undisputed.\n\nIn 1980, [[Philippines|Philippine]] President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] had invited the entire Junta (consisting at this point of Pinochet, Merino, Matthei, and Mendoza) to visit the country as part of a planned tour of Southeast Asia in an attempt to help improve their image and bolster military and economic relations with the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Due to intense U.S. Pressure at the last minute (while Pinochet's plane was halfway en route over the Pacific), Marcos cancelled the visit and denied Pinochet landing rights in the country. Pinochet and the junta were further caught off guard and humiliated when they were forced to land in Fiji to refuel for the planned return to Santiago, only to be met with airport staff who refused to assist the plane in any way (the Fijian military was called in instead), invasive and prolonged customs searches, exorbitant fuel and aviation service charges, and hundreds of angry protesters who pelted his plane with eggs and tomatoes. The usually stoic and calm Pinochet became enraged, firing his Foreign Minister Hernan Cubillos, several diplomats, and expelling the Philippine Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/04/02/filipino-rebuff-humiliates-pinochet/60da7bd2-b648-480f-909e-5651f5bea8ec/|title=Filipino Rebuff Humiliates Pinochet|first=Charles A.|last=Krause|date=2 April 1980|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023175426/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/04/02/filipino-rebuff-humiliates-pinochet/60da7bd2-b648-480f-909e-5651f5bea8ec/|archivedate=23 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Helen Spooner, ''Soldiers in a narrow land: the Pinochet regime in Chile'', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&id=lE1G1OBhsbMC url]</ref>  Relations between the two countries were restored only in 1986 when [[Corazon Aquino]] assumed the presidency of the Philippines after Marcos was ousted in a non-violent revolution, the [[People Power Revolution]].\n\n===United States===\n{{Further|United States intervention in Chile}}\n[[File:Orlando Letelier, Washingron DC, 1976 (de Marcelo Montecino).jpg|thumb|right|[[Orlando Letelier]], a former Chilean minister, was assassinated in Washington, D.C. in 1976]]\n[[File:Nlc02585cs.jpg|thumb|Pinochet meeting with U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] in Washington, D.C., September 6, 1977]]\nThe U.S. government had been interfering in Chilean politics since 1961, and it spent millions trying to prevent Allende from coming to power, and subsequently undermined his presidency through financing opposition.

Before that period ended, a candidate for President was to be proposed by the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate was to be ratified by registered voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.<ref>David Altma, \u201cLatin America\u201d, Referendums Around the World, 2018</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitutional Court of Chile]] ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by Article 64 in the Constitution. That included an \"Electoral Space\" during which all positions, in this case, two, ''S\u00ed'' (yes), and ''No'', would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition ''No'' campaign, headed by [[Ricardo Lagos]], produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in a TV interview, pointed his index finger towards the camera and directly called on Pinochet to account for all the \"disappeared\" persons. The ''S\u00ed'' campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting \"no\" was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.\n\nPinochet lost the 1988 referendum, where 56% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 44% for \"''S\u00ed''\", and, following the constitutional provisions, he stayed as President for one more year.  The [[1989 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] was held in December 1989, at the same time as congressional elections that were due to take place. Pinochet left the presidency on March 11, 1990 and transferred power to political opponent [[Patricio Aylwin]], the new democratically elected president. Due to the same transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998.\n\n===1989 General Elections===\nFrom the 1989 elections onwards the military had officially left the political sphere in Chile. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former Pinochet economic minister [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]] ran for president as candidate of the two right-wing parties [[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]] and [[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]. He had little political experience and was relatively young and credited with Chile's good economic performance in the second half of the 1980s. The right-wing parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, B\u00fcchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this [[right-wing populist]] [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera]] ran independently for president and made several election promises B\u00fcchi could not match.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nThe centre-left coalition [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] was more united and coherent. Its candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]], a [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]], behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with B\u00fcchi. B\u00fcchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the [[Communist Party of Chile]], a party that was not part of Concertaci\u00f3n.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/> Aylwin spoke with authority about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it; in contrast, B\u00fcchi, as a former regime minister, lacked any credibility when dealing with human right violations.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nB\u00fcchi and Err\u00e1zuriz lost to [[Patricio Aylwin]] in the election. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such a way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI in obtaining places in parliament and securing its political future. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\n===Presidential Election Results===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!

On his 91st birthday on 25 November 2006, in a public statement to supporters, Pinochet for the first time claimed to accept \"political responsibility\" for what happened in Chile under his regime, though he still defended the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]] against Salvador Allende. In a statement read by his wife Lucia Hiriart, he said, ''Today, near the end of my days, I want to say that I harbour no rancour against anybody, that I love my fatherland above all. ...

The dictatorship was established after the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|democratically-elected socialist government]] of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 11 September 1973. During this time, the country was ruled by a [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|military junta]] headed by General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende's presidency to justify its seizure of power.

Two years after its ascension radical [[neoliberal]] economic reforms were implemented, in sharp contrast to Allende's leftist policies, advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the [[Chicago Boys]]. Later, in 1980, the regime replaced the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925]] with a [[Constitution of Chile|new constitution]]. This established a series of provisions that would eventually lead to the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite]] on October 5 of that year.\n\nIn that referendum, the Chilean people denied Pinochet a new mandate, opening the way for the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of democracy in 1990]]. Consequently, democratic presidential elections were held the following year. The military dictatorship ended in 1990 with the election of [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian-Democrat]] candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]].

This was done with support of journalists who \"reported\" the supposed events; in some cases, the fake combats were also staged.

It is thought that the killing of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] leader [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (politician)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]] in 1974 could be an early case of a faked combat. The faked combats reinforced the dictatorship narrative on the existence of an \"internal war\" which it used to justify its existence.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Silva Hidalgo |first=Robinson Humberto |date=2014 |title=Resistencia pol\u00edtica y origen del movimiento social anti dictatorial en Chile (1973\u20131988) |type=Ph.D. |publisher=[[Universitat de Barcelona]] |url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |page=341\u2013349 |language=Spanish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216184935/http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/55488/1/RHSH_TESIS.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-16 }}</ref> A particular fake combat event, lasting from September 8 to 9 1983, occurred when forces of the CNI lobbed grenades into a house, detonating the structure and killing the two men and a woman who were in the building.

Leigh criticized Pinochet for having joined the coup very late and then pretending to keep all power for himself. In December 1974 Leigh opposed the proposal to name Pinochet president of Chile. Leigh recalls about that moment that, \"Pinochet was furious, he hit the board, broke the glass, injured his hand a little and bled. Then, Merino and Mendoza told me I should sign, because if not the junta would split. I signed.\". Leigh's primary concern was Pinochet's consolidating of the legislative and executive branches of government under the new government. In particular, Pinochet's decision to enact a plebiscite without formally alerting the other junta members.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ensalaco, Mark. 2000. Chile Under Pinochet : Recovering the Truth. Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> Leigh, although a fervent supporter of the regime and hater of marxist ideology, had already taken steps to separate the executive and legislative branches. Pinochet is said to have been angered by Leigh's continued founding of a structure to divide the executive and legislative branches, eventually leading to Pinochet consolidating power and Leigh being dumped from the regime.<ref>Barros, Robert.

Domestically, it was the second most powerful institution, behind Pinochet's government. While the Church remained politically neutral, its opposition to the regime came in the form of human rights advocacy and through the social movements that it gave a platform to. It achieved this through the establishment of the Cooperative Committee for Peace in Chile (COPACHI) and Vicariate of Solidarity. COPACHI was founded by [[Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez|Cardinal Raul Silve Henriquez]], Archbishop of Santiago, as an immediate response to the repression of the Pinochet regime. It was apolitical in a spirit of collaboration rather than conflict with the government. Pinochet developed suspicion of COPACHI, leading to its dissolution in late 1975. In response Silva founded the Vicariate in its place. Historian Hugo Fruhling's work highlights the multifaceted nature of Vicaria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corradi |first1=Juan |title=Fear at the Edge, State Terror and Resistance in Latin America |url=https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan |url-access=registration |date=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan/page/121 121\u2013141]}}</ref> Through developments and education programs in the shantytown area of Santiago, the Vicaria had mobilised around 44,000 people to join campaigns by 1979. The Church published a newsletter called ''Solidarity'' published in Chile and abroad, and supplied the public with information through radio stations. Vicaria pursued a legal strategy of defending human rights, not a political strategy to re-democratise Chile.\n\n====Jornadas de Protesta Nacional====\n\nThe Days of National Protest ([[:es:Jornadas de Protesta Nacional|Jornadas de Protesta Nacional]]) were days of civil demonstrations that periodically took place in Chile in the 1980s against the military junta. They were characterized by street demonstrations in the downtown avenues of the city in the mornings, strikes during the day, and barricades and clashes in the periphery of the city throughout the night. The protests were faced with increased government repression from 1984, with the biggest and last protest summoned in July 1986. The protests changed the mentality of many Chileans, strengthening opposition organizations and movements in the 1988 plebiscite.\n\n=== External Opposition ===\n\n==== Solidarity Campaigns & Exiles Movements ====\nThe regime's forced exile of over 200,000 Chileans led to areas of global opposition to the Pinochet government. However, the exiles themselves were not entirely responsible for the international resistance against Pinochet, but rather were able to gain the solidarity of many members of their host countries. Exiles were dispersed across the globe, and to all continents, with different factions of leftist opposition finding refuge in like-minded host countries. For example, the militant revolutionary MIR centring their operations in Havana, Cuba. While the efforts of exiles across the globe in actually militarily or financially supporting the domestic opposition to the junta were limited in their effectiveness, the more important work of the exiles came in their efforts in mobilising support among citizens in their host countries. As such, The Chile Solidarity Campaign (CSC) in the UK was relatively successful at petitioning the labour government. This included lobbying host governments and international organisations such as the United Nations to condemn the abuses of the dictatorship. The overall effect of this was the successful creation of a global solidarity movement.\n\n==Economy and free market reforms==\n[[Image:Chile- el pueblo vencera cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] as a [[concentration camp]] after the coup.]]\n{{Main|Economic history of Chile#1975-81}}\nAfter the military took over the government in 1973, a period of dramatic economic changes began. The Chilean economy was still faltering in the months following the coup. As the military junta itself was not particularly skilled in remedying the persistent economic difficulties, it appointed a group of Chilean economists who had been educated in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]]. Given financial and ideological support from Pinochet, the U.S., and international financial institutions, the [[Chicago Boys]] advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[free market|free-market]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]], and [[Conservatism#Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] policies, in stark contrast to the extensive [[nationalization]] and centrally-planned economic programs supported by Allende.<ref name=\"K.

Remmer 1998 5-55\"/>\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the era can be divided into two periods. The first, from 1975 to 1982, corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. The following period was characterized by new reforms and economic recovery. Some economists argue that the recovery was due to an about-face turnaround of Pinochet's free market policy, since he nationalized many of the same industries that were nationalized under Allende and fired the Chicago Boys from their government posts.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities and the re-privatization of companies that had briefly returned to government control during the 1982\u201383 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent.

Due to intense U.S. Pressure at the last minute (while Pinochet's plane was halfway en route over the Pacific), Marcos cancelled the visit and denied Pinochet landing rights in the country. Pinochet and the junta were further caught off guard and humiliated when they were forced to land in Fiji to refuel for the planned return to Santiago, only to be met with airport staff who refused to assist the plane in any way (the Fijian military was called in instead), invasive and prolonged customs searches, exorbitant fuel and aviation service charges, and hundreds of angry protesters who pelted his plane with eggs and tomatoes.

Before that period ended, a candidate for President was to be proposed by the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate was to be ratified by registered voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.<ref>David Altma, \u201cLatin America\u201d, Referendums Around the World, 2018</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitutional Court of Chile]] ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by Article 64 in the Constitution. That included an \"Electoral Space\" during which all positions, in this case, two, ''S\u00ed'' (yes), and ''No'', would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition ''No'' campaign, headed by [[Ricardo Lagos]], produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in a TV interview, pointed his index finger towards the camera and directly called on Pinochet to account for all the \"disappeared\" persons. The ''S\u00ed'' campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting \"no\" was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.\n\nPinochet lost the 1988 referendum, where 56% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 44% for \"''S\u00ed''\", and, following the constitutional provisions, he stayed as President for one more year.  The [[1989 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] was held in December 1989, at the same time as congressional elections that were due to take place. Pinochet left the presidency on March 11, 1990 and transferred power to political opponent [[Patricio Aylwin]], the new democratically elected president. Due to the same transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998.\n\n===1989 General Elections===\nFrom the 1989 elections onwards the military had officially left the political sphere in Chile. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former Pinochet economic minister [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]] ran for president as candidate of the two right-wing parties [[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]] and [[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]. He had little political experience and was relatively young and credited with Chile's good economic performance in the second half of the 1980s. The right-wing parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, B\u00fcchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this [[right-wing populist]] [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera]] ran independently for president and made several election promises B\u00fcchi could not match.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nThe centre-left coalition [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] was more united and coherent. Its candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]], a [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]], behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with B\u00fcchi. B\u00fcchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the [[Communist Party of Chile]], a party that was not part of Concertaci\u00f3n.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/> Aylwin spoke with authority about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it; in contrast, B\u00fcchi, as a former regime minister, lacked any credibility when dealing with human right violations.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nB\u00fcchi and Err\u00e1zuriz lost to [[Patricio Aylwin]] in the election. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such a way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI in obtaining places in parliament and securing its political future. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\n===Presidential Election Results===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!

He returned to Chile in March 2000 but was not charged with the crimes against him. On his 91st birthday on 25 November 2006, in a public statement to supporters, Pinochet for the first time claimed to accept \"political responsibility\" for what happened in Chile under his regime, though he still defended the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]] against Salvador Allende. In a statement read by his wife Lucia Hiriart, he said, ''Today, near the end of my days, I want to say that I harbour no rancour against anybody, that I love my fatherland above all. ...

The first episode <ref>Issue No 1263  (dated 28\u201310 May 2010)</ref> explained that \"Brown's Comprehensive\" had been replaced by the Academy, and the new motto is \"''Duo in Uno''\" (Latin for \"Two in One\").\n\nFrom May 2015 the academy was renamed the \"Cameron [[Free school (England)|Free School]]\", reflecting the [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative majority government]].\n\nIn July 2016 the school was renamed \"St Theresa's Independent State Grammar School for Girls (and Boys)\". Following the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 General Election]], the school incorporated the [[William III of England|William III]] Orange Academy, in reference to the confidence and supply deal that the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] reached with the [[Second May ministry|second ministry of Theresa May]].\n\n==Style==\nIt commonly includes a Headmaster's Message, though that is sometimes substituted by a message from the Deputy Head. The Deputy Head's Message is often cut short due to \"insufficient space\". Since 2016, the Deputy Head's Message has been replaced by The Bursar Writes..., this too is often cut short, however.\n\n\"Pupils\" are invariably referred to by their surname, for example [[Nick Ferrari]] is \"Ferrari, N\" and [[Danny Finkelstein]] is \"Finkelstein, D\" who contributes jokes.\n\nSports events such as [[The Ashes]] are referenced through the school's sports teams (the [[Cricket (sport)|First XI]] or [[Rugby (sport)|First XV]]).
