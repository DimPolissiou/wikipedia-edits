Some believe that capitalism can only be overcome through revolution while others believe that structural change can come slowly through [[Reformism|political reforms]]. Some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the [[social market]] movement).\n\nProminent among critiques of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently [[Wage slavery|exploitative]], [[unsustainable]] and creates [[economic inequality]], is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of [[human rights]] while it incentivizes [[imperialist]] expansion and [[Military\u2013industrial complex|war]].\n\n== History ==\n{{socialism sidebar}}\nAccording to contemporary critics{{quantify|date=April 2010}} of capitalism, [[Industrial Revolution|rapid industrialization]] in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including [[8-hour day|14-hour work days]], [[child labor]] and [[shanty towns]].<ref name=\"conditionsworking\">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html|title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living|author=Clark Nardinelli, economist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|work=The concise encyclopedia of economics|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Socialism|socialist]] thinkers rejected capitalism altogether, attempting to create socialist communities free of the perceived injustices of early capitalism. Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] released ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a contemporary of Marx, was another notable critic of capitalism and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].\n\nBy the early 20th century, myriad socialist tendencies (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g. [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as \"[[socialism of the 21st century]]\".\n\n== General criticism ==\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n{{see also|Anarchism|Libertarian socialism}}\nThe authors of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' state that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is by its very nature hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss during working hours (sometimes outside work too). They state: \"This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical? by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to them, this is why \"[c]apitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other \"resources\"\u2014that is to say its inseparability from its bearer\u2014labour, unlike other \"property,\" is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralized, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical?\" by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the influential German [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], [[private property]] is a \"spook\" which \"lives by the grace of law\" and \"becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law\". In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\".

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed \"[[capitalist roader]]s\", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these \"capitalist roaders\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{see also|Christian communism|Christian left|Christian socialism|Islamic socialism|Jewish left|Liberation theology|Religious communism|Social Gospel}}\nThe [[Catholic Church]] forbids [[usury]].<ref name=\"m6\">{{cite journal|ref=harv| doi=10.2307/3161033|page=6|jstor=3161033|title=The Christianization of Interest|journal=Church History|volume=3|issue=1|year=1934|last1=Moehlman|first1=Conrad Henry|author-link=Conrad Henry Moehlman}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicea I\">{{cite web|title=First Council of Nicea (A.D. 325)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=New Advent|website=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Lateran III\">{{cite web|title=Third Lateran Council \u2013 1179 A.D. \u2013 Papal Encyclicals|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum11.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=Papal Encyclicals Online|website=papalencyclicals.net|date=March 5, 1179}}</ref> As established by papal [[encyclicals]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' and ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'', [[Catholic social teaching]] does not support unrestricted capitalism, primarily because it is considered part of [[liberalism]] and secondly by its nature, which goes against social justice.

In an economic sense, exploitation is often related to the [[Wage slavery|expropriation]] of labor for [[profit (economics)|profit]] and based on [[Karl Marx]]'s version of the [[labor theory of value]]. The labor theory of value was supported by classical economists like [[David Ricardo]] and [[Adam Smith]] who believed that \"the value of a commodity depends on the relative quantity of labor which is necessary for its production\".<ref name=\"principlesvalue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/ricardo/tax/ch01.htm|title=Chapter 1: On Value \u2013 On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation|last=Ricardo|first=David|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx identified the commodity as the basic unit of capitalist organization.

In essence, workers must allow their labor to be exploited or face starvation.

Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]].

Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralized, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5).

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed \"[[capitalist roader]]s\", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these \"capitalist roaders\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{see also|Christian communism|Christian left|Christian socialism|Islamic socialism|Jewish left|Liberation theology|Religious communism|Social Gospel}}\nThe [[Catholic Church]] forbids [[usury]].<ref name=\"m6\">{{cite journal|ref=harv| doi=10.2307/3161033|page=6|jstor=3161033|title=The Christianization of Interest|journal=Church History|volume=3|issue=1|year=1934|last1=Moehlman|first1=Conrad Henry|author-link=Conrad Henry Moehlman}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicea I\">{{cite web|title=First Council of Nicea (A.D. 325)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=New Advent|website=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Lateran III\">{{cite web|title=Third Lateran Council \u2013 1179 A.D. \u2013 Papal Encyclicals|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum11.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=Papal Encyclicals Online|website=papalencyclicals.net|date=March 5, 1179}}</ref> As established by papal [[encyclicals]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' and ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'', [[Catholic social teaching]] does not support unrestricted capitalism, primarily because it is considered part of [[liberalism]] and secondly by its nature, which goes against social justice.

In an economic sense, exploitation is often related to the [[Wage slavery|expropriation]] of labor for [[profit (economics)|profit]] and based on [[Karl Marx]]'s version of the [[labor theory of value]].

Property is the right to use and abuse\".<ref name=\"propertytheft\" /> Many left-wing anarchists, such as [[anarchist communist]]s, believe in replacing capitalist private property with a system where people can lay claim to things based on personal use and claim that \"[private] property is the domination of an individual, or a coalition of individuals, over things; it is not the claim of any person or persons to the use of things\" and \"this is, usufruct, a very different matter. Property means the monopoly of wealth, the right to prevent others using it, whether the owner needs it or not\".<ref>''Anarchist Essays'', pp. 22\u201323, 40.

Examples include high tech commodities produced in countries with low average wages by multinational firms and then being sold in distant high income countries; materials and resources being extracted in some countries, turned into finished products in some others and sold as commodities in further ones; and countries exchanging with each other the same kind of commodities for the sake of consumers' choice (e.g. Europe both exporting and importing cars to and from the United States).

Their report goes on to link many seemingly disparate contemporary crises to this system, including environmental factors such as [[global warming]] and accelerated [[Holocene extinction|species extinctions]] and also societal factors such as rising [[economic inequality]], [[unemployment]], sluggish economic growth, rising debt levels, and impuissant governments unable to deal with these problems. The scientists say a new economic model, one which focuses on sustainability and efficiency and not profit and growth, will be needed as decades of robust economic growth driven by abundant resources and cheap energy is rapidly coming to a close.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43pek3/scientists-warn-the-un-of-capitalisms-imminent-demise|title=Scientists Warn the UN of Capitalism's Imminent Demise|last=Ahmed|first=Nafeez|date=August 27, 2018|work=Vice|access-date=August 30, 2018|location=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-capitalism-economy_us_5b87bf0ce4b0cf7b00326edc|title=We Cannot Fight Climate Change With Capitalism, Says Report|last=Paddison|first=Laura|date=August 31, 2018|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=September 2, 2018|location=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Almighty dollar]]\n* [[Anarchism and capitalism]]\n* [[Anti-globalisation]]\n* ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]''\n* [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Capitalist mode of production]]\n* [[Crisis (Marxian)]]\n* [[Criticisms of Marxism]]\n* [[Culture of capitalism]]\n* [[Cyberpunk]]\n* [[Economic calculation problem]]\n* [[Gift economy]]\n* [[Market fundamentalism]]\n* [[Post-capitalism]]\n* [[Social criticism]]\n* [[Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor]]\n* [[Surveillance capitalism]]\n* {{sectionlink|Technological fix#Concerns}}\n* ''[[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate]]''\n* ''[[Why Socialism?]]''\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060218034812/http://www.econ.boun.edu.tr/staff/adaman/research/adaman-devine.PDF A Reconsideration of the Theory of Entrepreneurship: a participatory approach] \u2013 critique of capitalism\n* [http://economicdemocracy.org/miners.html How The Miners Were Robbed] \u2013 1907 anti-capitalist pamphlet by John Wheatley\n* [http://reality.gn.apc.org/econ/hayek.htm Information and Economics: A Critique of Hayek] by Allin F.

It was the first year for the new [[FIA|AIACR]] [[World Manufacturers' Championship]] season. The championship was won by [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]], with its [[Alfa Romeo P2|P2]] model.\n\nIn January, the AIACR had settled on the championship format \u2013 four Grands Prix to be held in the USA, Belgium, France and Italy (of minimum 800km length), with compulsory attendance of the Italian GP and the manufacturer\u2019s home race to qualify. The best three of the four results would count. It ran on the successful 2-litre formula already in place.\n \nThis year, the [[Targa Florio]] was a competition between the French teams of Bugatti and [[Peugeot]] as the major Italian teams did not enter. In a close race, the Peugeots initially led but it was the smaller Bugatti of [[Bartolomeo Costantini]] that came through for the victory. [[Louis Wagner (driver)|Louis Wagner]] was second for Peugeot, after he was delayed when stopping to assist his teammate, Christian d'Auvergne, who had been seriously injured in an accident.\n\nOnly a small entry lined up for the [[Indianapolis 500]], dominated by [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Millers]]. [[Dave Lewis (racing driver)|Dave Lewis]]  ran the new Miller \u2013 the first front-wheel drive car to enter the race. The Duesenberg challenge was led by the previous year\u2019s winner [[Peter DePaolo]]. From the start the Duesenberg teammates DePaolo and [[Phil Shafer]] set the pace. Just after halfway, DePaolo pitted suffering from blistered hands to be replaced by Norman Batten. Lewis in the FWD Miller got to the lead but was reeled in by DePaolo after he had taken back his car. Lewis in turn was substituted by [[Bennett Hill]] who had retired earlier. Although Hill charged hard, DePaolo held on and won by almost a minute, with Shafer third. It was the first time the race had been won in under 5 hours, averaging over 100mph. Pete DePaolo would go on to win the AAA championship.\n\nThe inaugural Belgian Grand Prix had only seven entrants with only the Alfa Romeo and Delage works teams starting. Then when all four of the French cars had retired by half distance, it left just [[Antonio Ascari]] and [[Giuseppe Campari]] circulating to give Alfa Romeo a 1-2 victory. The blue riband French Grand Prix did have a more complete entry list and was held on the recently completed full circuit at [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]]. Once again Ascari leaped into the lead until he misjudged a corner and crashed. Seriously injured, he died on the way to the hospital. When the news was announced the rest of the Alfa Romeo team was withdrawn. After that, [[Robert Benoist]] led giving Delage a 1-2 victory and becoming the first Frenchman to win his home Grand Prix since 1913.\n\nThe [[Italian Grand Prix]] was the final race of the championship. Alfa Romeo, Delage and Duesenberg had one win apiece but Delage chose not to contest it. Duesenberg entered two cars for [[Tommy Milton]] and [[Peter Kreis]]. Indianapolis winner Pete DePaolo also came across, taking the place of Ascari in the Alfa Corse team. Bugatti entered its new 1.5-litre models. Kreis in the Duesenberg led at the start but crashed on lap 3. The Alfas then set the pace but when they pitted for fuel Milton led until he was delayed with a slow pitstop. Brilli-Peri took a comfortable win by 20 minutes from Campari, thus giving Alfa Romeo the Manufacturer\u2019s Championship.\n\nIn the middle of the year, Germany was admitted into the AIACR, allowing German teams to enter the Championship in 1926. This was the last year of the current 2-litre formula. Increased concerns about the high speeds and safety led the AIACR change the regulations the following year to the 1.5-litre voiturette class for Grand Prix racing.\n\n===Manufacturers' World Championship===\nSources: <ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 Season|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Speedfreaks.org|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025213/http://www.dlg.speedfreaks.org/archive/gen/1925.html|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.360\"> Rendall 1993, p.360</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=ChampCar Stats|url= http://www.champcarstats.com/year/1925.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=MotorSport AAA results|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/championships/indycars/1925-aaa-national-championship|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

In the United States, the [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA) stayed with the same regulations as well. The AIACR followed the American example to remove the mandatory mechanic on-board, replacing him with a compulsory rear-view mirror instead.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.110\"> Rendall 1993, p.110</ref> As the circuits used became shorter, as well as the danger to the passenger, the mechanic had become superfluous.<ref name=\"Legate 2006, p.12\"> Legate 2006, p.12</ref> Incongruously, the cars still had to be 2-seaters.<ref name=\"Monkhouse 1953, p.6\"> Monkhouse 1953, p.6</ref> \n\nThe Targa Florio regulations remained open to any sized cars. The smallest engine classes were merged up to 1.1-litres and only ran three laps. Each car had a minimum weight of 120kg and, unlike other regulations, had to have a driver and a mechanic (who was not permitted to drive). The crew was allowed to be swapped at the end of a lap with a pre-registered substitute crew. With a maximum time limit of 10 hours, each entry had to finish within an hour of the class winner to be classified.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grand Prix Winners 1895\u20131949|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gpw5.htm|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> The Targa Florio and Coppa Florio were held simultaneously, with the Coppa was held over just four laps, with teams paying extra to enter both races. The Coppa Ciano was only open to factory entries who had registered. The two smaller classes \u2013 to 1.1-litre and to 1.5-litre only ran 3 laps.<ref name=\"florio\">{{cite web |last1=Etzrodt |first1=Hans |title=Costantini wins the Targa Florio, Boillot with Peugeot the Coppa Florio |url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2503.htm#10 |website=The Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing |accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n=== [[World Manufacturers' Championship|The World Championship]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.68\"> Cimarosti 1997, p.68</ref> ===\nAs early as the October 1923 meeting of the AIACR, there were discussions about holding an international championship. The initial ideas were for a European competition including grand prix, touring car and endurance events but there were concerns about achieving a balance of performance.\n\nAt the January 1925 meeting, the Automobile Club of Italy gave its proposal to the committee \u2013 for an ongoing international series through to 1930. The 1925 season would comprise the existing Grand Prix of Italy, France and Indianapolis as well as new Grand Prix for Spain, Belgium and Great Britain. The committee voted to omit the Spanish GP, and [[Brooklands]] had to cancel the British race because of legal action with neighbours about noise complaints. Each race had to be at least 800km long and run to the existing 2-litre formula. Cars had a minimum empty weight of 650kg and be a 2-seater with a minimum width of 80cm. The riding mechanic was banned but a rear-view mirror was now compulsory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe championship was for manufacturers, not individual drivers, and to be eligible teams had to enter the Italian GP, as well their own national GP if available. They would only score points from their best three results of the four races. The winning manufacturer would receive FF70000 cash prize as well as a FF30000 bronze and gold trophy designed by Italian sculptor Antonio Maraini.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nOnly the best-finishing car for each manufacturer would score points, which were awarded as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Position\n!Points\n|-\n|1st place\n|1\n|-\n|2nd place\n|2\n|-\n|3rd place\n|3\n|-\n|All other finishers\n|4\n|-\n|All non-finishers\n|5\n|-\n|Not starting\n|6\n|}\n\nAnd in the case of a tie, a 200km race-off would be held at Monza within 2 days of the Italian GP. At the February meeting the committee ratified the proposal. They also voted to exclude German teams from the Championship, as Germany was not a member of the AIACR, and they were still not permitted to officially race in France, Great Britain or Belgium.\n\nNote: Information is limited as the AIACR did not release official notices or confirm the results. Etzrodt has pieced together information from contemporary magazines. For example, it is unclear whether only works teams scored points or privateers could score for the manufacturer. Likewise, it was not stipulated whether racing specials based on a given chassis would score separately (for example the various Miller specials that were popular in the USA).<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Technical Innovation===\n[[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] and [[Rolland Pilain]] had retired from motor-racing. Alfa Romeo had dominated the previous year with their [[Alfa Romeo P2|P2]] model. Between seasons, chief engineer [[Vittorio Jano]] further developed the engine, boosting its output from 145 up to 155&nbsp;bhp. With new fuel for the year, an additional forward fuel tank was fitted for the higher consumption, as were larger drum brakes.<ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.67\"> Cimarosti 1997, p.67</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n[[File:1925 Monza Alfa P2 Pete de Paolo and Ramponi.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Italian GP: Pete DePaolo and mechanic Ramponi, Alfa Romeo P2]]\n\nDelage joined the other top manufacturers by supercharging their 2-litre V12 engine. They chose to use twin Roots-style superchargers. The power output was 190bhp, closing in on the \u201cmagical\u201d 100bhp per litre milestone. However, despite a 5-speed gearbox, the chassis was still not capable of transferring all the power to the road.<ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.67\"/> The bonnet was now louvered to try and dissipate the great amount of heat generated by the engine.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> With riding mechanics now banned, [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]] fitted their cars with a fuel pump to maintain fuel pressure, which was a role the mechanic used to do.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2509.htm#34|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n[[File:L'\u00e9quipe Delage en 1925, Benoist, Divo au volant, et Ren\u00e9 Thomas Directeur du service des courses (Delage 2LCV).jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Delage team of Benoist, Divo and Thomas (team manager)]]\n\nThere were also several specials entered in Grand Prix. [[Albert Guyot]] had been a regular driver for [[Rolland-Pilain]] who had also raced at the Indianapolis race since before the war. He took three of the Rolland-Pilain cars, adding a Cozette supercharger to a new [[Sleeve valve#Burt-McCollum|Burt-McCollum sleeve-valve engine]]. English driver Ernest Eldridge took an [[Amilcar]] GS and fitted a 1.5-litre supercharged Anzani side-valve engine that got up to 185&nbsp;km/h.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1924 Indianapolis race, [[Jimmy Murphy (racing driver)|Jimmy Murphy]] had suggested to [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Harry Miller]] that a lower centre-of-gravity would increase cornering speeds. That could be achieved with front-wheel drive obviating the need for a central driveshaft. Miller started work on it but, sadly Murphy was killed later in the year. The Miller FWD had a supercharger giving out 200&nbsp;bhp. He also supplied supercharger kits to his customers that they could retrofit to their cars, which many did.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.110\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.34\"> Fox 1973, p.34</ref>\n\nThe Duesenberg had a vanes-type compressor, that could rev at up to 30000 rpm, far higher than the Roots supercharger. This format gave them better performance at low speeds. The wider wheelbase also gave greater cornering stability.<ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.32\"> Montagna 1989, p.32</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! Manufacturer\n!

Originally opened in 1921, it was a roughly triangular track with similar elevation changes to the French circuit at [[Lyons]]. Right on the frontier, the [[Malmedy]] corner was in former German territory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nGrand prix racing also extended across the Mediterranean to [[Libya]]. Intended to increase tourism and prospective immigrants, an event was organised in the Italian province of [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]]. The first official racing events in Africa were held on a 70km road circuit heading out from the south of [[Tripoli]], the provincial capital.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2502.htm#6|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==Season review==\nThis year the season opener was a new event, the Grand Prix of Rome, held in February. The race was run on a 10.6km circuit on the streets of [[Rome]] north of the [[Vatican City]]. A big field of 35 starters lined up for an overall prize of 100000 lire. Predominantly Italians, a number of top drivers entered including ''Conte'' [[Gastone Brilli-Peri]] in a [[Ballot]] designed for the 1919 Indianapolis race, [[Emilio Materassi]] with his pair of his modified [[Itala]]s and ''Conte'' Carlo Masetti in a Bugatti 35. He was the older brother of [[Giulio Masetti]], the famous double-winner of the Targa Florio. The only foreign driver was [[Christian Werner]], who was driving as a privateer; in the Mercedes with which he had the won the 1924 Targa Florio. Brilli Peri led initially but retired with a broken gearbox, and Werner crashed and had to retire. Alberto Ascari, who had replaced Giovanni Minozzi in his Alfa Romeo, crashed heavily on the steep downhill section while overtaking ''Conte'' [[Aymo Maggi]] in a smaller car. Fortunately, despite bowling two telephone poles, both emerged unscathed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Masetti won by nearly half an hour from Materassi, giving Bugatti its first win in Italy at its first attempt.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"> Rendall 1993, p.111</ref>\n\nThe first racing event in Africa had an inauspicious start. The boat bringing the small-engine cars from Italy mistakenly offloaded them in [[Benghazi]], so their race was delayed by two days. This left a small field of five in the over 2-litre class in their own race on the Thursday. Then on Saturday the ten smaller cars had their race. [[Renato Balestrero]], works driver for [[Officine Meccaniche|OM]] won from [[Luigi Plat\u00e9]], who drove his Chiribiri with his wife as the co-driver.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2502.htm#6|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n\n[[File:La Targa Florio en 1925.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Start/Finish line at the Targa Florio, beside Cerda railway station]]\nThe Bugatti team returned to Italy for the Targa Florio. Once again, the event was run in conjunction with the Coppa Florio, with that being based on the results of the event's first four laps of the newly-sealed [[Madonie]] circuit. In 1924, the grandstands had been destroyed by a fire but within a year they had been rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Targa Florio|url=http://www.targaflorio.info/16.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\nWhereas in 1924 the German teams arrived in force, this year it was the French. Bugatti had a three-car team with [[Bartolomeo Costantini]] and the Spanish de Vizcaya brothers, [[Pierre de Vizcaya|Pierre]] and Ferdinand. [[Peugeot]] returned with four of their Type 174 sports cars with [[Andr\u00e9 Boillot]], [[Louis Wagner (driver)|Louis Wagner]], [[Victor Rigal]] and Christian d'Auvergne as the drivers. None of the Italian works teams turned up, with the small field filled out by privateers. \nThe field started at 4-minute intervals with the Peugeots, as the only entrants in the Coppa Florio, going out first.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#10|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> They set the early pace with Boillot setting a new lap record on the first circuit (assisted by the better quality roads). Going into the third lap, now led by Wagner they were running 1-2-3 with Costantini three minutes behind. However, d'Auvergne missed a corner, hit a wall and rolled. His mechanic was thrown clear while d'Auvergne lay pinned under the burning car. Wagner, following a few minutes behind, stopped and together with the mechanic pulled his badly injured teammate from the wreck before re-joining the race.<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Targa Florio|url=http://www.targaflorio.info/16.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Costantini meanwhile was picking up his pace and was ahead on elapsed time by the end of the third lap. He drove a smooth incident-free run, putting in the fastest lap of the race on his final lap to beat the Peugeots of Wagner and Boillot, to win the Targa.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"/> By dint of Peugeot being the only team to register for the Coppa, Andr\u00e9 Boillot won that prize.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#10|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Along with their 1922 victory, Peugeot became the first two-time winners and were awarded the Coppa Florio, but decided to put it up for competition again.<ref name=\"Fondi 2006, p.345\"> Fondi 2006, p.345</ref> \n\nThe Grand Prix d\u2019Ouverture heralded the official opening for racing at the completed [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry]] outside of Paris. Held on the oval circuit, it was restricted to ''voiturettes'' up to 1.5-litres with 150000 francs in prizes. A big field was therefore expected but this waned when the works teams from Bugatti and Chiribiri withdrew. This left the Talbot team as the overwhelming favourites, with [[Henry Segrave]], George Duller and ''Conte'' [[Caberto Conelli]]. They were joined by racing specials from [[J. G. Parry-Thomas]] and [[Ernest Eldridge]]. Against them were teams from some of the many small French manufacturers springing up: La Perle, [[Bucciali]], [[Jean Gras]] and [[Salmson]]. A pedestrian race ended in rain with the expected 1-2-3 result for the Talbots led by Duller, 20 laps ahead of Eldridge.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2504.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Motorsport magazine 1\">{{Cite web|title=InvincibleTalbots|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-1979/47/the-editor-looks-at-the-legand-of-the-invincible|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Conelli had been racing hard to catch Duller and as the latter eased off to take the flag Conelli clipped his car, rolled and skated past the line\u2013 perhaps the only driver to get a podium after finishing a race upside down.<ref name=\"Georgano 1971, p.196\"> Georgano 1971, p.196</ref>\n\n\nOne of the smallest entry lists for the [[Indianapolis 500]] was once again dominated by the Miller 122, in various guises, with 16 of the 22 starters. [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Harry Miller]] had developed his front-wheel drive model, which [[Cliff Durant]] entered as a \u201cJunior-8\u201d for [[Dave Lewis (racing driver)|Dave Lewis]] \u2013 the first front-wheel drive car to be at the race. He also ran a standard Miller for teammate [[Earl Cooper]]. Miller's own team driver, [[Bennett Hill]], tested the car but preferred to race the older, rear-wheel drive version with a supercharger instead.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"/> [[Harry Hartz]] also ran supercharged Millers for himself, [[Fred Comer]] and [[Leon Duray]], as did previous race-winners [[Tommy Milton]] and [[Ralph DePalma]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ultimate Racing History|url=http://www.ultimateracinghistory.com/race.php?raceid=19988|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nUp against the Millers was [[Fred Duesenberg]]'s cars. The four supercharged 122s were led by the previous year's winner [[Peter DePaolo]] in what he called his \u201cBanana Wagon\u201d.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"> Fox 1973, p.35</ref> Circuit director Pop Meyers had travelled to Europe to encourage their teams to come to the race, but they all refused. FIAT driver [[Pietro Bordino]] had been racing his [[Fiat Automobiles|805]] in the USA since the previous year and entered his car as a privateer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Ludvigsen 2008, p.37\"> Ludvigsen 2008, p.37</ref> After over a decade, the brick surface was becoming increasingly rough.

They had 122 cubic inch (2-litre) engines, but the chassis were narrow single-seaters less than 80cm wide. This year the AAA lifted the qualifying speed to an average of 85mph \u2013 or 7m 30s over a 4-lap, 10-mile run. Duray set a new lap record of 113.2mph to get pole position. Second fastest was DePaolo and his Duesenberg with Duray's team-leader Hartz completing the front row. Last year\u2019s co-winner, [[Lora L. Corum|L.L. Corum]], crashed his car in Friday practise and would not be a starter, becoming a relief driver for DePaolo instead.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nRace day was sunny and warm, and 145000 spectators arrived.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> DePaolo took the lead from the start, and after 100 miles was just ahead of the veterans Cooper and Hartz, with less than 30 seconds covering the top five. <ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"/> Bordino was an early stop at the pits, losing two laps to change spark plugs. At quarter distance, DePaolo's teammate, rookie [[Phil Shafer]] (who had been the final qualifier, starting at the back) had moved up to second and the pair duelled for the lead for the next eighty miles. \n\nMany of the drivers were being shaken up and exhausted by the rough surface and a number of relief drivers were employed. Bordino stopped again, with an injured hand and while he went to the track hospital [[Antoine Mourre]] took over the Fiat. Soon after [[Herbert Jones (racing driver)|Herb Jones]]'s Miller crashed into the wall and caught fire. Jones was also taken to the track hospital with injuries. Just after halfway, DePaolo pitted suffering from blistered hands and was replaced by Norman Batten.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> As the pitstops worked through, this soon put Cooper into the lead until a puncture nudged him into the wall and he had to pit.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"/> DePaolo had got back into his car again on lap 127 and, running fourth, set off after the leaders. Lewis, in the Miller FD, ran at the front but in ten laps was hauled in and passed by DePaolo. An exhausted Lewis finally pitted to be relieved by Bennett Hill who had retired early with suspension issues. Although Hill charged hard, DePaolo held on and won by almost a minute, or half a lap, from Hill, with Shafer third.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.36\"> Fox 1973, p.36</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Racing Reference|url= https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1925_International_500/UO|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> It was the first time the race had been won in under 5 hours, averaging 101.3mph.

It was the inaugural Belgian Grand Prix and part of the World Championship, but only the Alfa Romeo and Delage works teams arrived. Sunbeam claimed its cars were not ready, as did Alfred Guyot. Alfa Corse had Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Campari and Gastone Brilli-Peri as their drivers, with the latter running an older, 1924, model. The four Delages (driven by team manager [[Ren\u00e9 Thomas (racing driver)|Ren\u00e9 Thomas]], [[Albert Divo]], [[Robert Benoist]] and Paul Torchy) were now fitted with twin superchargers. In practice the two teams had similar lap times, although grid positions were still drawn by lot unlike Indianapolis.\nFrom the start, Ascari took off with a big lead over his teammates Campari and Brilli-Peri. The Delages had an abysmal time and all failed during the race. Benoist pulled into the pits on just the second lap with a cracked fuel-tank. Thomas' car caught fire and even though Divo kept up with the Alfas, the strain burnt out the supercharger. Just after halfway through the race there were only the Alfas of Ascari and Campari left. An apocryphal story has risen about the race: The partisan Belgian crowd were very disappointed and booed the Italian team. In response, team manager Vittorio Jano called his drivers in to stop for a lunchbreak. However, this is refuted by Etzrodt who says it was just a methodical pit-stop to change all four tyres on both cars. They then went back out to complete a farcical 1-2 victory.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.113\"> Rendall 1993, p.113</ref><ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.67\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe next round of the championship, the French Grand Prix, was held at the new track at [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]]. Now completed with its road section to complement the banked oval, it was the first French GP not held on a public-road circuit. This time all the main protagonists turned up: [[Alfa Corse]] returned with their three cars and drivers. This time Delage had just three cars, with Thomas' destroyed, and Louis Wagner brought in to join Divo and Benoist. Thomas apparently had been fired as team chief for taking money for deficient connecting rods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> There were three works Bugattis for \u201cMeo\u201d Costantini, Pierre de Vizcaya and veteran [[Jules Goux]], along with two privateer entries for Pierre\u2019s brother Ferdinand and Giulio Foresti. Finally, the Sunbeam team arrived from Britain with three cars for [[Henry Segrave]] and the Italian counts [[Giulio Masetti]] and [[Caberto Conelli]].<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.113\"/>\n[[File:D\u00e9part du Grand Prix de l'A.C.F. 1925.jpg|thumb|300px|right|French GP: de Vizcaya (Bugatti) ahead of Ascari (Alfa Romeo)]]\nAfter a confused rolling-start, it was Ascari who led at the end of the first lap. Divo was second but dropped back after just three laps to retire again with supercharger issues. Ascari built a comfortable lead while Campari, Benoist and Masetti competed duelled behind him. Then on the 22nd lap, after two hours racing, Ascari cut a corner too close, slide and mowed down 100 metres of fencing, before the car rolled twice throwing the driver out. Badly injured, but conscious, he was pulled free but died on the way to the hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2509.htm#34|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> When the news came through the crowd was stunned and the other two Alfa Corse cars were withdrawn.<ref name=\"Monkhouse 1953, p.6\"/> \nThe remainder of the race was fairly pedestrian.

Aided by Divo as the rain closed in,<ref name=\"Venables 2009, p.46\"> Venables 2009, p.46</ref> he went on to win the race, the first Frenchman to win his home Grand Prix since [[Georges Boillot]] in [[1913 French Grand Prix|1913]].

Delage felt they were beaten and instead chose to concentrate on preparing for the upcoming (non-Championship) San Sebasti\u00e1n Grand Prix.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Duesenberg, though, did arrive with two cars, for Tommy Milton and young new driver [[Peter Kreis]].

The Bugatti works team entered its new 1.5-litre [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 37|Type 37]] and supercharged [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 39|Type 39]], in anticipation of the change in GP formula coming up in 1926.

But it was short-lived. After setting what turned out to be the fastest lap of the race, he crashed at the Lesmo curves on lap 3. The car rolled but Kreis was unhurt.<ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.33\"> Montagna 1989, p.33</ref> Campari then led from Brilli-Peri at the head of the field. Milton stayed with the two red cars and took the lead when they pitted for fuel on lap 32. Campari had a slow stop while Brilli-Peri had a quick pitstop and came out in second. He took the lead when Milton was delayed with his stop and took a comfortable win, almost 20 minutes ahead of Campari. The supercharged Bugatti of Costantini was third, ten minutes back, just ahead of Milton and DePaolo.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.113\"/><ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.33\"/><ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.197\"> Montagna 1989, p.197</ref>\n\nThe victory clinched the inaugural World Championship for Alfa Romeo.

The Lasarte track south of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] was a 18km circuit on sealed public roads. A huge crowd turned out, including the Spanish King and Queen, for the rolling start at 9am. In the early part Divo led Masetti\u2019s Sunbeam and the other Delages of Benoist and Thomas and the Bugatti of Costantini. On the fifth lap the race was marred by the crash of the fourth Delage driver Paul Torchy. He had gone off the road when trying to pass the Sunbeam.

Mercedes, Benz and Opel led a number of German companies continuing to develop new cars and engineering. However, in May, the German Automobile Club was re-admitted into the AIACR and in November, back into the CSI regulatory body.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grand Prix Winners 1895\u20131949|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gpw5.htm|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> Local races in Germany were increasing in number.

It was the first year for the new [[FIA|AIACR]] [[World Manufacturers' Championship]] season. The championship was won by [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]], with its [[Alfa Romeo P2|P2]] model.\n\nIn January, the AIACR had settled on the championship format \u2013 four Grands Prix to be held in the USA, Belgium, France and Italy (of minimum 800km length), with compulsory attendance of the Italian GP and the manufacturer\u2019s home race to qualify. The best three of the four results would count. It ran on the successful 2-litre formula already in place.\n \nThis year, the [[Targa Florio]] was a competition between the French teams of Bugatti and [[Peugeot]] as the major Italian teams did not enter. In a close race, the Peugeots initially led but it was the smaller Bugatti of [[Bartolomeo Costantini]] that came through for the victory. [[Louis Wagner (driver)|Louis Wagner]] was second for Peugeot, after he was delayed when stopping to assist his teammate, Christian d'Auvergne, who had been seriously injured in an accident.\n\nOnly a small entry lined up for the [[Indianapolis 500]], dominated by [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Millers]]. [[Dave Lewis (racing driver)|Dave Lewis]]  ran the new Miller \u2013 the first front-wheel drive car to enter the race. The Duesenberg challenge was led by the previous year\u2019s winner [[Peter DePaolo]]. From the start the Duesenberg teammates DePaolo and [[Phil Shafer]] set the pace. Just after halfway, DePaolo pitted suffering from blistered hands to be replaced by Norman Batten. Lewis in the FWD Miller got to the lead but was reeled in by DePaolo after he had taken back his car. Lewis in turn was substituted by [[Bennett Hill]] who had retired earlier. Although Hill charged hard, DePaolo held on and won by almost a minute, with Shafer third. It was the first time the race had been won in under 5 hours, averaging over 100mph. Pete DePaolo would go on to win the AAA championship.\n\nThe inaugural Belgian Grand Prix had only seven entrants with only the Alfa Romeo and Delage works teams starting. Then when all four of the French cars had retired by half distance, it left just [[Antonio Ascari]] and [[Giuseppe Campari]] circulating to give Alfa Romeo a 1-2 victory. The blue riband French Grand Prix did have a more complete entry list and was held on the recently completed full circuit at [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]]. Once again Ascari leaped into the lead until he misjudged a corner and crashed. Seriously injured, he died on the way to the hospital. When the news was announced the rest of the Alfa Romeo team was withdrawn. After that, [[Robert Benoist]] led giving Delage a 1-2 victory and becoming the first Frenchman to win his home Grand Prix since 1913.\n\nThe [[Italian Grand Prix]] was the final race of the championship. Alfa Romeo, Delage and Duesenberg had one win apiece but Delage chose not to contest it. Duesenberg entered two cars for [[Tommy Milton]] and [[Peter Kreis]]. Indianapolis winner Pete DePaolo also came across, taking the place of Ascari in the Alfa Corse team. Bugatti entered its new 1.5-litre models. Kreis in the Duesenberg led at the start but crashed on lap 3. The Alfas then set the pace but when they pitted for fuel Milton led until he was delayed with a slow pitstop. Brilli-Peri took a comfortable win by 20 minutes from Campari, thus giving Alfa Romeo the Manufacturer\u2019s Championship.\n\nIn the middle of the year, Germany was admitted into the AIACR, allowing German teams to enter the Championship in 1926. This was the last year of the current 2-litre formula. Increased concerns about the high speeds and safety led the AIACR change the regulations the following year to the 1.5-litre voiturette class for Grand Prix racing.\n\n===Manufacturers' World Championship===\nSources: <ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 Season|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Speedfreaks.org|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025213/http://www.dlg.speedfreaks.org/archive/gen/1925.html|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.360\"> Rendall 1993, p.360</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=ChampCar Stats|url= http://www.champcarstats.com/year/1925.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=MotorSport AAA results|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/championships/indycars/1925-aaa-national-championship|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

In the United States, the [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA) stayed with the same regulations as well. The AIACR followed the American example to remove the mandatory mechanic on-board, replacing him with a compulsory rear-view mirror instead.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.110\"> Rendall 1993, p.110</ref> As the circuits used became shorter, as well as the danger to the passenger, the mechanic had become superfluous.<ref name=\"Legate 2006, p.12\"> Legate 2006, p.12</ref> Incongruously, the cars still had to be 2-seaters.<ref name=\"Monkhouse 1953, p.6\"> Monkhouse 1953, p.6</ref> \n\nThe Targa Florio regulations remained open to any sized cars. The smallest engine classes were merged up to 1.1-litres and only ran three laps. Each car had a minimum weight of 120kg and, unlike other regulations, had to have a driver and a mechanic (who was not permitted to drive). The crew was allowed to be swapped at the end of a lap with a pre-registered substitute crew. With a maximum time limit of 10 hours, each entry had to finish within an hour of the class winner to be classified.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grand Prix Winners 1895\u20131949|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gpw5.htm|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> The Targa Florio and Coppa Florio were held simultaneously, with the Coppa was held over just four laps, with teams paying extra to enter both races. The Coppa Ciano was only open to factory entries who had registered.

The initial ideas were for a European competition including grand prix, touring car and endurance events but there were concerns about achieving a balance of performance.\n\nAt the January 1925 meeting, the Automobile Club of Italy gave its proposal to the committee \u2013 for an ongoing international series through to 1930. The 1925 season would comprise the existing Grand Prix of Italy, France and Indianapolis as well as new Grand Prix for Spain, Belgium and Great Britain. The committee voted to omit the Spanish GP, and [[Brooklands]] had to cancel the British race because of legal action with neighbours about noise complaints. Each race had to be at least 800km long and run to the existing 2-litre formula. Cars had a minimum empty weight of 650kg and be a 2-seater with a minimum width of 80cm. The riding mechanic was banned but a rear-view mirror was now compulsory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe championship was for manufacturers, not individual drivers, and to be eligible teams had to enter the Italian GP, as well their own national GP if available. They would only score points from their best three results of the four races. The winning manufacturer would receive FF70000 cash prize as well as a FF30000 bronze and gold trophy designed by Italian sculptor Antonio Maraini.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nOnly the best-finishing car for each manufacturer would score points, which were awarded as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Position\n!Points\n|-\n|1st place\n|1\n|-\n|2nd place\n|2\n|-\n|3rd place\n|3\n|-\n|All other finishers\n|4\n|-\n|All non-finishers\n|5\n|-\n|Not starting\n|6\n|}\n\nAnd in the case of a tie, a 200km race-off would be held at Monza within 2 days of the Italian GP. At the February meeting the committee ratified the proposal. They also voted to exclude German teams from the Championship, as Germany was not a member of the AIACR, and they were still not permitted to officially race in France, Great Britain or Belgium.\n\nNote: Information is limited as the AIACR did not release official notices or confirm the results. Etzrodt has pieced together information from contemporary magazines. For example, it is unclear whether only works teams scored points or privateers could score for the manufacturer. Likewise, it was not stipulated whether racing specials based on a given chassis would score separately (for example the various Miller specials that were popular in the USA).<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Technical Innovation===\n[[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] and [[Rolland Pilain]] had retired from motor-racing. Alfa Romeo had dominated the previous year with their [[Alfa Romeo P2|P2]] model. Between seasons, chief engineer [[Vittorio Jano]] further developed the engine, boosting its output from 145 up to 155&nbsp;bhp. With new fuel for the year, an additional forward fuel tank was fitted for the higher consumption, as were larger drum brakes.<ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.67\"> Cimarosti 1997, p.67</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n[[File:1925 Monza Alfa P2 Pete de Paolo and Ramponi.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Italian GP: Pete DePaolo and mechanic Ramponi, Alfa Romeo P2]]\n\nDelage joined the other top manufacturers by supercharging their 2-litre V12 engine. They chose to use twin Roots-style superchargers. The power output was 190bhp, closing in on the \u201cmagical\u201d 100bhp per litre milestone. However, despite a 5-speed gearbox, the chassis was still not capable of transferring all the power to the road.<ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.67\"/> The bonnet was now louvered to try and dissipate the great amount of heat generated by the engine.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> With riding mechanics now banned, [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]] fitted their cars with a fuel pump to maintain fuel pressure, which was a role the mechanic used to do.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2509.htm#34|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n[[File:L'\u00e9quipe Delage en 1925, Benoist, Divo au volant, et Ren\u00e9 Thomas Directeur du service des courses (Delage 2LCV).jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Delage team of Benoist, Divo and Thomas (team manager)]]\n\nThere were also several specials entered in Grand Prix. [[Albert Guyot]] had been a regular driver for [[Rolland-Pilain]] who had also raced at the Indianapolis race since before the war. He took three of the Rolland-Pilain cars, adding a Cozette supercharger to a new [[Sleeve valve#Burt-McCollum|Burt-McCollum sleeve-valve engine]]. English driver Ernest Eldridge took an [[Amilcar]] GS and fitted a 1.5-litre supercharged Anzani side-valve engine that got up to 185&nbsp;km/h.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1924 Indianapolis race, [[Jimmy Murphy (racing driver)|Jimmy Murphy]] had suggested to [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Harry Miller]] that a lower centre-of-gravity would increase cornering speeds. That could be achieved with front-wheel drive obviating the need for a central driveshaft. Miller started work on it but, sadly Murphy was killed later in the year. The Miller FWD had a supercharger giving out 200&nbsp;bhp. He also supplied supercharger kits to his customers that they could retrofit to their cars, which many did.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.110\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.34\"> Fox 1973, p.34</ref>\n\nThe Duesenberg had a vanes-type compressor, that could rev at up to 30000 rpm, far higher than the Roots supercharger. This format gave them better performance at low speeds. The wider wheelbase also gave greater cornering stability.<ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.32\"> Montagna 1989, p.32</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! Manufacturer\n!

Originally opened in 1921, it was a roughly triangular track with similar elevation changes to the French circuit at [[Lyons]]. Right on the frontier, the [[Malmedy]] corner was in former German territory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nGrand prix racing also extended across the Mediterranean to [[Libya]]. Intended to increase tourism and prospective immigrants, an event was organised in the Italian province of [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]]. The first official racing events in Africa were held on an a 70km road circuit heading out from the south of [[Tripoli]], the provincial capital.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2502.htm#6|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==Season review==\nThis year the season opener was a new event, the Grand Prix of Rome, held in February. The race was run on a 10.6km circuit on the streets of [[Rome]] north of the [[Vatican City]]. A big field of 35 starters lined up for an overall prize of 100000 lire. Predominantly Italians, a number of top drivers entered including ''Conte'' [[Gastone Brilli-Peri]] in a [[Ballot]] designed for the 1919 Indianapolis race, [[Emilio Materassi]] with his pair of his modified [[Itala]]s and ''Conte'' Carlo Masetti in a Bugatti 35. He was the older brother of [[Giulio Masetti]], the famous double-winner of the Targa Florio. The only foreign driver was [[Christian Werner]], who was driving as a privateer; in the Mercedes with which he had the won the 1924 Targa Florio. Brilli Peri led initially but retired with a broken gearbox, and Werner crashed and had to retire. Alberto Ascari, who had replaced Giovanni Minozzi in his Alfa Romeo, crashed heavily on the steep downhill section while overtaking ''Conte'' [[Aymo Maggi]] in a smaller car. Fortunately, despite bowling two telephone poles, both emerged unscathed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Masetti won by nearly half an hour from Materassi, giving Bugatti its first win in Italy at its first attempt.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"> Rendall 1993, p.111</ref>\n\nThe first racing event in Africa had an inauspicious start. The boat bringing the small-engine cars from Italy mistakenly offloaded them in [[Benghazi]], so their race was delayed by two days. This left a small field of five in the over 2-litre class in their own race on the Thursday. Then on Saturday the ten smaller cars had their race. [[Renato Balestrero]], works driver for [[Officine Meccaniche|OM]] won from [[Luigi Plat\u00e9]], who drove his Chiribiri with his wife as the co-driver.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2502.htm#6|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n\n[[File:La Targa Florio en 1925.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Start/Finish line at the Targa Florio, beside Cerda railway station]]\nThe Bugatti team returned to Italy for the Targa Florio. Once again, the event was run in conjunction with the Coppa Florio, with that being based on the results of the event's first four laps of the newly-sealed [[Madonie]] circuit. In 1924, the grandstands had been destroyed by a fire but within a year they had been rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Targa Florio|url=http://www.targaflorio.info/16.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\nWhereas in 1924 the German teams arrived in force, this year it was the French. Bugatti had a three-car team with [[Bartolomeo Costantini]] and the Spanish de Vizcaya brothers, [[Pierre de Vizcaya|Pierre]] and Ferdinand. [[Peugeot]] returned with four of their Type 174 sports cars with [[Andr\u00e9 Boillot]], [[Louis Wagner (driver)|Louis Wagner]], [[Victor Rigal]] and Christian d'Auvergne as the drivers. None of the Italian works teams turned up, with the small field filled out by privateers. \nThe field started at 4-minute intervals with the Peugeots, as the only entrants in the Coppa Florio, going out first.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#10|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> They set the early pace with Boillot setting a new lap record on the first circuit (assisted by the better quality roads). Going into the third lap, now led by Wagner they were running 1-2-3 with Costantini three minutes behind. However, d'Auvergne missed a corner, hit a wall and rolled. His mechanic was thrown clear while d'Auvergne lay pinned under the burning car. Wagner, following a few minutes behind, stopped and together with the mechanic pulled his badly injured teammate from the wreck before re-joining the race.<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Targa Florio|url=http://www.targaflorio.info/16.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Costantini meanwhile was picking up his pace and was ahead on elapsed time by the end of the third lap. He drove a smooth incident-free run, putting in the fastest lap of the race on his final lap to beat the Peugeots of Wagner and Boillot, to win the Targa.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"/> By dint of Peugeot being the only team to register for the Coppa, Andr\u00e9 Boillot won that prize.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#10|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Along with their 1922 victory, Peugeot became the first two-time winners and were awarded the Coppa Florio, but decided to put it up for competition again.<ref name=\"Fondi 2006, p.345\"> Fondi 2006, p.345</ref> \n\nThe Grand Prix d\u2019Ouverture heralded the official opening for racing at the completed [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry]] outside of Paris. Held on the oval circuit, it was restricted to ''voiturettes'' up to 1.5-litres with 150000 francs in prizes. A big field was therefore expected but this waned when the works teams from Bugatti and Chiribiri withdrew. This left the Talbot team as the overwhelming favourites, with [[Henry Segrave]], George Duller and ''Conte'' [[Caberto Conelli]]. They were joined by racing specials from [[J. G. Parry-Thomas]] and [[Ernest Eldridge]]. Against them were teams from some of the many small French manufacturers springing up: La Perle, [[Bucciali]], [[Jean Gras]] and [[Salmson]]. A pedestrian race ended in rain with the expected 1-2-3 result for the Talbots led by Duller, 20 laps ahead of Eldridge.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2504.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Motorsport magazine 1\">{{Cite web|title=InvincibleTalbots|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-1979/47/the-editor-looks-at-the-legand-of-the-invincible|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Conelli had been racing hard to catch Duller and as the latter eased off to take the flag Conelli clipped his car, rolled and skated past the line\u2013 perhaps the only driver to get a podium after finishing a race upside down.<ref name=\"Georgano 1971, p.196\"> Georgano 1971, p.196</ref>\n\n\nOne of the smallest entry lists for the [[Indianapolis 500]] was once again dominated by the Miller 122, in various guises, with 16 of the 22 starters. [[Harry Miller (auto racing)|Harry Miller]] had developed his front-wheel drive model, which [[Cliff Durant]] entered as a \u201cJunior-8\u201d for [[Dave Lewis (racing driver)|Dave Lewis]] \u2013 the first front-wheel drive car to be at the race. He also ran a standard Miller for teammate [[Earl Cooper]]. Miller's own team driver, [[Bennett Hill]], tested the car but preferred to race the older, rear-wheel drive version with a supercharger instead.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"/> [[Harry Hartz]] also ran supercharged Millers for himself, [[Fred Comer]] and [[Leon Duray]], as did previous race-winners [[Tommy Milton]] and [[Ralph DePalma]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ultimate Racing History|url=http://www.ultimateracinghistory.com/race.php?raceid=19988|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nUp against the Millers was [[Fred Duesenberg]]'s cars. The four supercharged 122s were led by the previous year's winner [[Peter DePaolo]] in what he called his \u201cBanana Wagon\u201d.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"> Fox 1973, p.35</ref> Circuit director Pop Meyers had travelled to Europe to encourage their teams to come to the race, but they all refused. FIAT driver [[Pietro Bordino]] had been racing his [[Fiat Automobiles|805]] in the USA since the previous year and entered his car as a privateer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Ludvigsen 2008, p.37\"> Ludvigsen 2008, p.37</ref> After over a decade, the brick surface was becoming increasingly rough.

They had 122 cubic inch (2-litre) engines, but the chassis were narrow single-seaters less than 80cm wide. This year the AAA lifted the qualifying speed to an average of 85mph \u2013 or 7m 30s over a 4-lap, 10-mile run. Duray set a new lap record of 113.2mph to get pole position. Second fastest was DePaolo and his Duesenberg with Duray's team-leader Hartz completing the front row. Last year\u2019s co-winner, [[Lora L. Corum|L.L. Corum]], crashed his car in Friday practise and would not be a starter, becoming a relief driver for DePaolo instead.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nRace day was sunny and warm, and 145000 spectators arrived.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> DePaolo took the lead from the start, and after 100 miles was just ahead of the veterans Cooper and Hartz, with less than 30 seconds covering the top five. <ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"/> Bordino was an early stop at the pits, losing two laps to change spark plugs. At quarter distance, DePaolo's teammate, rookie [[Phil Shafer]] (who had been the final qualifier, starting at the back) had moved up to second and the pair duelled for the lead for the next eighty miles. \n\nMany of the drivers were being shaken up and exhausted by the rough surface and a number of relief drivers were employed. Bordino stopped again, with an injured hand and while he went to the track hospital [[Antoine Mourre]] took over the Fiat. Soon after [[Herbert Jones (racing driver)|Herb Jones]]'s Miller crashed into the wall and caught fire. Jones was also taken to the track hospital with injuries. Just after halfway, DePaolo pitted suffering from blistered hands and was replaced by Norman Batten.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2505.htm#20|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> As the pitstops worked through, this soon put Cooper into the lead until a puncture nudged him into the wall and he had to pit.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.35\"/> DePaolo had got back into his car again on lap 127 and, running fourth, set off after the leaders. Lewis, in the Miller FD, ran at the front but in ten laps was hauled in and passed by DePaolo. An exhausted Lewis finally pitted to be relieved by Bennett Hill who had retired early with suspension issues. Although Hill charged hard, DePaolo held on and won by almost a minute, or half a lap, from Hill, with Shafer third.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.111\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.36\"> Fox 1973, p.36</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Racing Reference|url= https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1925_International_500/UO|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> It was the first time the race had been won in under 5 hours, averaging 101.3mph.

It was the inaugural Belgian Grand Prix and part of the World Championship, but only the Alfa Romeo and Delage works teams arrived. Sunbeam claimed its cars were not ready, as did Alfred Guyot. Alfa Corse had Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Campari and Gastone Brilli-Peri as their drivers, with the latter running an older, 1924, model. The four Delages (driven by team manager [[Ren\u00e9 Thomas (racing driver)|Ren\u00e9 Thomas]], [[Albert Divo]], [[Robert Benoist]] and Paul Torchy) were now fitted with twin superchargers. In practice the two teams had similar lap times, although grid positions were still drawn by lot unlike Indianapolis.\nFrom the start, Ascari took off with a big lead over his teammates Campari and Brilli-Peri. The Delages had an abysmal time and all failed during the race. Benoist pulled into the pits on just the second lap with a cracked fuel-tank. Thomas' car caught fire and even though Divo kept up with the Alfas, the strain burnt out the supercharger. Just after halfway through the race there were only the Alfas of Ascari and Campari left. An apocryphal story has risen about the race: The partisan Belgian crowd were very disappointed and booed the Italian team. In response, team manager Vittorio Jano called his drivers in to stop for a lunchbreak. However, this is refuted by Etzrodt who says it was just a methodical pit-stop to change all four tyres on both cars. They then went back out to complete a farcical 1-2 victory.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.113\"> Rendall 1993, p.113</ref><ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.67\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2508.htm|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe next round of the championship, the French Grand Prix, was held at the new track at [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]]. Now completed with its road section to complement the banked oval, it was the first French GP not held on a public-road circuit. This time all the main protagonists turned up: [[Alfa Corse]] returned with their three cars and drivers. This time Delage had just three cars, with Thomas' destroyed, and Louis Wagner brought in to join Divo and Benoist. Thomas apparently had been fired as team chief for taking money for deficient connecting rods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> There were three works Bugattis for \u201cMeo\u201d Costantini, Pierre de Vizcaya and veteran [[Jules Goux]], along with two privateer entries for Pierre\u2019s brother Ferdinand and Giulio Foresti. Finally, the Sunbeam team arrived from Britain with three cars for [[Henry Segrave]] and the Italian counts [[Giulio Masetti]] and [[Caberto Conelli]].<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.113\"/>\n[[File:D\u00e9part du Grand Prix de l'A.C.F. 1925.jpg|thumb|300px|right|French GP: de Vizcaya (Bugatti) ahead of Ascari (Alfa Romeo)]]\nAfter a confused rolling-start, it was Ascari who led at the end of the first lap. Divo was second but dropped back after just three laps to retire again with supercharger issues. Ascari built a comfortable lead while Campari, Benoist and Masetti competed duelled behind him. Then on the 22nd lap, after two hours racing, Ascari cut a corner too close, slide and mowed down 100 metres of fencing, before the car rolled twice throwing the driver out. Badly injured, but conscious, he was pulled free but died on the way to the hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2509.htm#34|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> When the news came through the crowd was stunned and the other two Alfa Corse cars were withdrawn.<ref name=\"Monkhouse 1953, p.6\"/> \nThe remainder of the race was fairly pedestrian.

Delage felt they were beaten and instead chose to concentrate on preparing for the upcoming (non-Championship) San Sebasti\u00e1n Grand Prix.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Duesenberg, though, did arrive with two cars, for Tommy Milton and young new driver [[Peter Kreis]]. Indianapolis winner Pete DePaolo also came across, taking the place of Ascari in the Alfa Corse team, alongside Campari and Brilli-Peri.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.113\"/> [[Tazio Nuvolari]] had originally been selected but had crashed heavily in the trial when the car's gearbox seized (heavily bandaged he then went out  the next week to win the Grand Prix des Nations motorcycle race in pouring rain).<ref name=\"Georgano 1971, p.269\"> Georgano 1971, p.269</ref> Fellow Italian manufacturer [[Diatto]] had two new cars, designed by [[Alfieri Maserati]]<ref name=\"Georgano 1971, p.254\"> Georgano 1971, p.254</ref> and driven by himself and Emilio Materassi,<ref name=\"Ludvigsen 2008, p.67\"> Ludvigsen 2008, p.67</ref> with the final 2-litre entrant being former pre-war Delage driver [[Albert Guyot]] in his own Special.\nThe Organisers also had a separate trophy for 1.5-litre ''Voiturette'' cars. The Bugatti works team entered its new 1.5-litre [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 37|Type 37]] and supercharged [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 39|Type 39]], in anticipation of the change in GP formula coming up in 1926. Their competition was from two [[Chiribiri]]s and [[Ernest Eldridge]]\u2019s special. <ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.32\"/> After the accident at Montlh\u00e9ry, the Lesmo corners were modified putting a 60cm strip of sand to even out the inside of the bends. A banked wall was also put on the final, fastest, corner of the oval.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2511.htm#42|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe Duesenbergs were fastest in practice, although it was said the Alfas had held back to conserve the cars. <ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.32\"/> From the start, Kreis in his Duesenberg bolted from the second row into the lead. But it was short-lived. After setting what turned out to be the fastest lap of the race, he crashed at the Lesmo curves on lap 3. The car rolled but Kreis was unhurt.<ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.33\"> Montagna 1989, p.33</ref> Campari then led from Brilli-Peri at the head of the field. Milton stayed with the two red cars and took the lead when they pitted for fuel on lap 32. Campari had a slow stop while Brilli-Peri had a quick pitstop and came out in second. He took the lead when Milton was delayed with his stop and took a comfortable win, almost 20 minutes ahead of Campari. The supercharged Bugatti of Costantini was third, ten minutes back, just ahead of Milton and DePaolo.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.113\"/><ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.33\"/><ref name=\"Montagna 1989, p.197\"> Montagna 1989, p.197</ref>\n\nThe victory clinched the inaugural World Championship for Alfa Romeo. Henceforth the iconic [[Alfa Romeo#Logos|Visconti badge]] carried on their cars had a laurel wreath added to the design to celebrate the achievement.<ref name=\"Rendall 1993, p.110\"/><ref name=\"Cimarosti 1997, p.68\"/><ref name=\"Ludvigsen 2008, p.45\"> Ludvigsen 2008, p.45</ref>\n\n\n[[File:III Gran Premio Autom\u00f3vilistico de San Sebasti\u00e1n (3 de 4) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|350px|right|San Sebasti\u00e1n: Bugattis of Divo & Benoist before the race]]\n[[File:III Gran Premio Autom\u00f3vilistico de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1 de 4) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|350px|right|San Sebasti\u00e1n: Masetti and his Sunbeam]]\nDelage had chosen to miss the Italian Grand Prix for the race in Spain a fortnight later. The team arrived with four cars, as did the Bugatti team while Giulio Masetti ran a sole Sunbeam works car. The Lasarte track south of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] was a 18km circuit on sealed public roads. A huge crowd turned out, including the Spanish King and Queen, for the rolling start at 9am. In the early part Divo led Masetti\u2019s Sunbeam and the other Delages of Benoist and Thomas and the Bugatti of Costantini. On the fifth lap the race was marred by the crash of the fourth Delage driver Paul Torchy. He had gone off the road when trying to pass the Sunbeam. Slamming into roadside trees, he was crushed fatally against his steering wheel.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Motorsport Memorial|url= http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&n=796|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2501.htm#2|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> At the halfway point, the Delages pitted to refuel. Andr\u00e9 Morel relieved Divo and Benoist took the lead. The Bugattis had all run into issues and Masetti retired the Sunbeam soon after with faulty steering. Thereafter it was clear running for the Delages and Divo led home a 1-2-3 result over the Bugatti team.<ref name=\"Venables 2009, p.47\"> Venables 2009, p.47</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2511.htm#44|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\nThe proliferation of races across Italy spread into France with the advent of two well-supported local races \u2013 the [[Grand Prix de la Marne|Marne Grand Prix]] held near [[Reims]] and the [[Grand Prix du Comminges|Comminges Grand Prix]] at [[Saint-Gaudens, Haute-Garonne|St Gaudens]], near [[Toulouse]]. \n\nGerman and Austrian manufacturers and drivers had not been allowed to compete in races held in France, Belgium or Great Britain since the end of the war. Mercedes, Benz and Opel led a number of German companies continuing to develop new cars and engineering. However, in May, the German Automobile Club was re-admitted into the AIACR and in November, back into the CSI regulatory body.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grand Prix Winners 1895\u20131949|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gpw5.htm|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> Local races in Germany were increasing in number. In May, [[Otto Merz]] in a 2-litre Mercedes won the main race in an opening weekend of the new [[Solitude Racetrack|Solitude]] circuit around the castle of the same name near [[Stuttgart]] in front of over 100000 spectators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Solitude-Rennen|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2503.htm#12|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Georgano 1971, p.257\"> Georgano 1971, p.257</ref> Similarly, the [[Eifelrennen]] event was a 3-day festival of racing for cars and motorbikes. When the Mercedes team withdrew from the main race, it lost a lot of its interest and the wet Ardennes weather further detracted from the occasion. Vittorio Rosa won overall in an Alfa Romeo RL<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eifel-Rennen|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp2503.htm#26|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Unlike in France and Italy with their number of road and track races, and [[Brooklands]] in England with its open-class handicap races, the German racing scene placed equal emphasis on winning hill-climbs with many being held across the country. \n\nThis was the last year of the 2-litre formula that had been in place since 1922. It had been a successful innovation, dramatically advancing engine design and bringing the advent of supercharging. But becoming more and more concerned with the higher speeds, the AIACR decided that a new 1.5-litre formula for Grand prix racing would come into effect as of the 1926 season.\n\n==Championship final standings==\nTable lists the  highest race position for each manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1925 World Championship|url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha25.htm|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref><br>\n'' ** non-participation disqualified the manufacturer from the championship''\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align:center\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!valign=\"middle\"| Pos\n!valign=\"middle\"| Manufacturer\n!
