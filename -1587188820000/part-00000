It is ''commonly thought'' to be so named because of the [[Muslim Burial Ground, Horsell Common|Muslim Burial Ground]] established for Muslim Indian soldiers who died in the service of the British Empire in the Great War of 1914\u20131918. The cemetery no longer contains graves, the corpses having been interred in the Pakistani cemetery close to the mosque, however the walls, entrance and corner towers of the cemetery still remain intact, and they bear a clearly oriental Indian style. The cemetery is set well back from the road and remained hidden until surrounding woods and shrubbery were pruned and thinned.\n\nMonument Way is probably a reference to a much earlier structure in the area that was destroyed by natural causes in the mid-1800s:\n\n<blockquote>\"Early in the 17th century Sir [[Edward Zouch]] obtained the Manor of Woking and gained permission to demolish the old palace site. He used some of the material to build a new house \u2013 Hoe Place (now a private school) \u2013 with some of the Tudor bricks apparently being used in buildings such as The Old House in OLD WOKING and 'The Monument' \u2013 a tower that once stood on the hill where the Hoe Bridge Golf Course is today.

It is ''commonly thought'' to be so named because of the [[Muslim Burial Ground, Horsell Common|Muslim Burial Ground]] established for Muslim Indian soldiers who died in the service of the British Empire in the Great War of 1914\u20131918. The cemetery no longer contains graves, the corpses having been interred in the Pakistani cemetery close to the mosque, however the walls, entrance and corner towers of the cemetery still remain intact, and they bear a clearly oriental Indian style. The cemetery is set well back from the road and remained hidden until surrounding woods and shrubbery were pruned and thinned.\n\nMonument Way is probably a reference to a much earlier structure in the area that was destroyed by natural causes in the mid-1800s:\n\n<blockquote>\"Early in the 17th century Sir [[Edward Zouch]] obtained the Manor of Woking and gained permission to demolish the old palace site. He used some of the material to build a new house \u2013 Hoe Place (now a private school) \u2013 with some of the Tudor bricks apparently being used in buildings such as The Old House in OLD WOKING and 'The Monument' \u2013 a tower that once stood on the hill where the Hoe Bridge Golf Course is today. It was Sir Edward's grandson, Sir James Zouch, who obtained the Market Charter for Woking in 1661, with the Market House (opposite the entrance to Church Street) being built in 1665.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfalls.co.uk/AreaInfo/History/Woking/Woking17c.php |title=Area Info \u2013 An introduction to Woking's heritage \u2013 Woking through the ages \u2013 17th/18th Century Woking |publisher=Waterfalls |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:WokingStation.jpg|right|thumb|[[Woking railway station]], Platform 5 (south) side]]\n{{stn|Woking}} is on the [[Alton Line]], [[Portsmouth Direct Line]], [[South Western Main Line]] and [[West of England Main Line]].

Among the key issues were that China was a major source of pirated musical compact disks and video laser disks, along with virtually all the computer software sold in China. On intellectual property rights, there was no enforcement of China's written laws, and as a result the piracy and theft of American-produced music, videos and software was costing American companies $1 billion a year by 1994 ($1.73 billion in 2019 dollars).<ref name=NYT-1994>[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/world/us-may-thwart-china-s-trade-goal.html?searchResultPosition=1 \"U.S. May Thwart China's Trade Goal\"], ''New York Times'', July 24, 1994</ref>\n\nBy 2000, Clinton said he was optimistic on achieving a fair agreement: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street.

By 2020, tariffs would reduce the level of real U.S. GDP by about 0.3%, reduce real consumption by 0.3%, reduce real private investment by 1.3%, and reduce real household income by $580 (about 1%). Real U.S. exports would be 1.7% lower and real imports would be 2.6% lower. CBO explained tariffs reduce U.S. economic activity in three ways: 1) Consumer and capital goods become more expensive; 2) Business uncertainty increases, thereby reducing or slowing investment; and 3) Other countries impose retaliatory tariffs, making U.S. exports more expensive and thus reducing them. CBO estimated the U.S. had imposed tariffs on 11% of imports by January 2018. As of July 25, 2019, retaliatory tariffs had been imposed on 7% of all U.S. goods exports. CBO expects the negative consequences will remain but have a smaller impact in 2029, as businesses adjust their supply chains (i.e., source from countries not affected by tariffs).<ref name = \"CBO_Update\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55551|title=An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|date=August 21, 2019|website=CBO.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Stock market===\nUncertainty due to the trade war has caused turbulence in the stock market,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/12/stock-market-global-stocks-gain-amid-us-china-trade-war-fears/1984586001/ |title=Stocks move lower as trade war anxiety lingers |date=August 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/29/investing/asian-market-latest-us-china-trade-war/index.html |title=Asian markets rally after China's trade comments soothe nerves |last=He |first=Laura |date=August 30, 2019}}</ref> with investors \"rattled\" by the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/26/us-stock-markets-post-christmas-sp-500-dow-nasdaq |title=Dow up more than 1,000 points in biggest one-day gain ever  |date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn December 4, 2018, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] logged its worst day in nearly a month as it declined nearly 600 points, to which some argue is in part due to the trade war.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-drop-100-points-as-doubts-over-us-china-trade-deal-emerge-2018-12-04|title=Dow closes down 800 points as U.S.-China trade, flattening yield curve spook investors|last=Matthews|first=Sue Chang, Chris|date=|website=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>\n\nOn August 14, 2019 the Dow dropped 800 points, partly caused by increasing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/14/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html|title=Dow tumbles 800 points after bond market flashes a recession warning |last=Business|first=David Goldman, CNN|website=CNN|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> Nine days later, on August 23, the Dow dropped 223 points in five minutes after Trump \"hereby ordered\" American companies to immediately seek alternatives to doing business in China;

Among the key issues were that China was a major source of pirated musical compact disks and video laser disks, along with virtually all the computer software sold in China. On intellectual property rights, there was no enforcement of China's written laws, and as a result the piracy and theft of American-produced music, videos and software was costing American companies $1 billion a year by 1994 ($1.73 billion in 2019 dollars).<ref name=NYT-1994>[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/world/us-may-thwart-china-s-trade-goal.html?searchResultPosition=1 \"U.S. May Thwart China's Trade Goal\"], ''New York Times'', July 24, 1994</ref>\n\nBy 2000, Clinton said he was optimistic on achieving a fair agreement: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street.

By 2020, tariffs would reduce the level of real U.S. GDP by about 0.3%, reduce real consumption by 0.3%, reduce real private investment by 1.3%, and reduce real household income by $580 (about 1%). Real U.S. exports would be 1.7% lower and real imports would be 2.6% lower. CBO explained tariffs reduce U.S. economic activity in three ways: 1) Consumer and capital goods become more expensive; 2) Business uncertainty increases, thereby reducing or slowing investment; and 3) Other countries impose retaliatory tariffs, making U.S. exports more expensive and thus reducing them. CBO estimated the U.S. had imposed tariffs on 11% of imports by January 2018. As of July 25, 2019, retaliatory tariffs had been imposed on 7% of all U.S. goods exports. CBO expects the negative consequences will remain but have a smaller impact in 2029, as businesses adjust their supply chains (i.e., source from countries not affected by tariffs).<ref name = \"CBO_Update\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55551|title=An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|date=August 21, 2019|website=CBO.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Stock market===\nUncertainty due to the trade war has caused turbulence in the stock market,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/12/stock-market-global-stocks-gain-amid-us-china-trade-war-fears/1984586001/ |title=Stocks move lower as trade war anxiety lingers |date=August 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/29/investing/asian-market-latest-us-china-trade-war/index.html |title=Asian markets rally after China's trade comments soothe nerves |last=He |first=Laura |date=August 30, 2019}}</ref> with investors \"rattled\" by the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/26/us-stock-markets-post-christmas-sp-500-dow-nasdaq |title=Dow up more than 1,000 points in biggest one-day gain ever  |date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn December 4, 2018, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] logged its worst day in nearly a month as it declined nearly 600 points, to which some argue is in part due to the trade war.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-drop-100-points-as-doubts-over-us-china-trade-deal-emerge-2018-12-04|title=Dow closes down 800 points as U.S.-China trade, flattening yield curve spook investors|last=Matthews|first=Sue Chang, Chris|date=|website=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>\n\nOn August 14, 2019 the Dow dropped 800 points, partly caused by increasing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/14/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html|title=Dow tumbles 800 points after bond market flashes a recession warning |last=Business|first=David Goldman, CNN|website=CNN|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> Nine days later, on August 23, the Dow dropped 223 points in five minutes after Trump \"hereby ordered\" American companies to immediately seek alternatives to doing business in China;

Buffon also holds the record for the most [[clean sheet]]s in Serie A, and with the Italy national team. He is one of the few recorded players to have made over [[List of footballers with the most official appearances|1,000 professional career appearances]].\n\nAt club level, Buffon's professional career began with Parma in 1995, where he made his Serie A debut. He soon broke into the starting line-up and earned a reputation as one of the most promising young goalkeepers in Italy, helping Parma to win the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Cup, and the Supercoppa Italiana, in 1999. After joining Juventus in 2001, for the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|world record fee for a goalkeeper]] of \u20ac52 million at the time, Buffon won Serie A titles in both of his first two seasons at the club, and established himself as one of the best players in the world in his position. With Juventus, he won a record nine Serie A titles,{{refn|name=\"revoked\"|group=\"nb\"}} four Coppa Italia titles, and five Supercoppa Italiana titles. He is the first goalkeeper to win [[Serie A Footballer of the Year]] award. He was named [[Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year]] a record 12 times. After reaching the [[2015 UEFA Champions League Final|2015]] and [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final|2017 Champions League finals]], he was named to the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League#Squad of the season|Champions League Squad of the Season]] on [[2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League#Squad of the season|both occasions]], and won the inaugural [[The Best FIFA Goalkeeper]] award in the latter year. After 17 years with Juventus, Buffon signed with French club Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 40 in 2018, where he was used in a rotational role with [[Alphonse Areola]]; he immediately won the Troph\u00e9e des Champions and the Ligue 1 title in his only season with the team, before returning to Juventus the following year. During the 2019\u201320 season, he served primarily as a back-up to [[Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny]], and equalled [[Paolo Maldini]]'s [[Football records in Italy#Appearances|record of 647 appearances in Serie A]].\n\nWith [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|176 international caps]], Buffon is the most [[Cap (sports)|capped]] player in the [[Italy national football team records and statistics#Appearances|history of the Italy national team]], the fourth-most capped footballer of all time, and the most capped European international player ever; Buffon also holds the record [[Italy national football team records and statistics#Captains|most appearances for Italy as captain]] after he inherited the armband in 2010. Buffon was called up for a record of five FIFA World Cup tournaments ([[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]) since making his debut in 1997; he was an unused substitute in the 1998 edition. He was the starting goalkeeper of the squad that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He also represented Italy at four [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]]s, at the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Olympics]], and at two [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]s, winning a bronze medal in the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]] edition of the tournament. Following his performances during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where he kept a record five clean sheets, he won the [[Yashin Award]], in which he was also elected to be part of the [[FIFA World Cup 2006#All-star team|Team of the Tournament]]; an [[UEFA European Championship Teams of the Tournament|honour]] which he also received after reaching the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Championship]], and the final of the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 European Championship]]. He retired from international football in 2017, after Italy failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], although he later came out of retirement for the team's friendlies the following year, before officially confirming his international retirement in May 2018.\n\nBuffon was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the world's greatest living players in 2004. He is the only goalkeeper to have won the [[UEFA Club Footballer of the Year]] award, which he won after reaching the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]]; he also won the award for best Goalkeeper that year. He has also been voted into the [[UEFA Team of the Year]] five times.

Buffon also holds the record for the most [[clean sheet]]s in Serie A, and with the Italy national team. He is one of the few recorded players to have made over [[List of footballers with the most official appearances|1,000 professional career appearances]].\n\nAt club level, Buffon's professional career began with Parma in 1995, where he made his Serie A debut. He soon broke into the starting line-up and earned a reputation as one of the most promising young goalkeepers in Italy, helping Parma to win the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Cup, and the Supercoppa Italiana, in 1999. After joining Juventus in 2001, for the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|world record fee for a goalkeeper]] of \u20ac52 million at the time, Buffon won Serie A titles in both of his first two seasons at the club, and established himself as one of the best players in the world in his position. With Juventus, he won a record nine Serie A titles,{{refn|name=\"revoked\"|group=\"nb\"}} four Coppa Italia titles, and five Supercoppa Italiana titles. He is the first goalkeeper to win [[Serie A Footballer of the Year]] award. He was named [[Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year]] a record 12 times. After reaching the [[2015 UEFA Champions League Final|2015]] and [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final|2017 Champions League finals]], he was named to the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League#Squad of the season|Champions League Squad of the Season]] on [[2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League#Squad of the season|both occasions]], and won the inaugural [[The Best FIFA Goalkeeper]] award in the latter year. After 17 years with Juventus, Buffon signed with French club Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 40 in 2018, where he was used in a rotational role with [[Alphonse Areola]]; he immediately won the Troph\u00e9e des Champions and the Ligue 1 title in his only season with the team, before returning to Juventus the following year. During the 2019\u201320 season, he served primarily as a back-up to [[Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny]], and equalled [[Paolo Maldini]]'s [[Football records in Italy#Appearances|record of 647 appearances in Serie A]].\n\nWith [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|176 international caps]], Buffon is the most [[Cap (sports)|capped]] player in the [[Italy national football team records and statistics#Appearances|history of the Italy national team]], the fourth-most capped footballer of all time, and the most capped European international player ever; Buffon also holds the record [[Italy national football team records and statistics#Captains|most appearances for Italy as captain]] after he inherited the armband in 2010. Buffon was called up for a record of five FIFA World Cup tournaments ([[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]) since making his debut in 1997; he was an unused substitute in the 1998 edition. He was the starting goalkeeper of the squad that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He also represented Italy at four [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]]s, at the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Olympics]], and at two [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]s, winning a bronze medal in the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]] edition of the tournament. Following his performances during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where he kept a record five clean sheets, he won the [[Yashin Award]], in which he was also elected to be part of the [[FIFA World Cup 2006#All-star team|Team of the Tournament]]; an [[UEFA European Championship Teams of the Tournament|honour]] which he also received after reaching the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Championship]], and the final of the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 European Championship]]. He retired from international football in 2017, after Italy failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], although he later came out of retirement for the team's friendlies the following year, before officially confirming his international retirement in May 2018.\n\nBuffon was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the world's greatest living players in 2004. He is the only goalkeeper to have won the [[UEFA Club Footballer of the Year]] award, which he won after reaching the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]]; he also won the award for best Goalkeeper that year. He has also been voted into the [[UEFA Team of the Year]] five times. Buffon was the runner-up for the [[2006 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]] in 2006, and has been elected part of the [[FIFPro]] World XI three times. He is the first goalkeeper ever to win the [[Golden Foot]] Award.
