Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p.146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p.25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p.190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp.164-165.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp.190-192.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp.33-34.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u2013242.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest. Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p.146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p.25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p.190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp.164-165.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp.190-192.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp.33-34.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u2013242.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

In this manner, the fate of the Jewish community was inextricably linked to the fate of Albanian society as a whole.\n\nAll religion was strictly banned from the country. After the fall of Communism in 1991, nearly all the Jews of Albania emigrated. They left primarily for economic reasons and not because of anti-Semitism.

In this manner, the fate of the Jewish community was inextricably linked to the fate of Albanian society as a whole.\n\nAll religion was strictly banned from the country. After the fall of Communism in 1991, nearly all the Jews of Albania emigrated. They left primarily for economic reasons and not because of anti-Semitism. Some 298 Albanian Jews emigrated to [[Israel]] (mostly settling in [[Ashdod]] and [[Karmiel]]) and about 30 others moved to the United States.

The first remains of ''Talarurus'' were discovered in 1948 and later described by the Russian paleontologist [[Evgeny Maleev]] with the type species ''T. plicatospineus''. It is known from multiple yet sparce specimens, making it one of the most well known ankylosaurines, along with ''[[Pinacosaurus]]''. Elements from the specimens consists of some bones from the body, however, five skulls have been discovered and assigned to the genus, although the first two were very fragmented.\n\nIt was a medium-sized, heavily built, ground-dwelling, [[quadrupedal]] [[herbivore]], that could grow up to {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and weighed about {{convert|454|to|907|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, nearly a ton. Like other ankylosaurs it had heavy [[armour (zoology)|armour]] and a [[club (zoology)|club]] on its tail, making much of its mobility slow. ''Talarurus'' is classified as a member of the [[Ankylosauria]], in the [[Ankylosaurinae]], a group of derived ankyosaurs. Talarurus is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], being likely niche partitioned with ''[[Tsagantegia]]'', as indicated by its muzzle, which has a rectangular shape specialized for grazing. These represent the oldest known ankylosaurines from Asia, although they are not very closely related to each other. It appears that the closest relative of ''Talarurus'' was ''[[Nodocephalosaurus]]'', an ankylosaurin with similar facial osteoderms.\n\nMost of the skeletal mounts of ''Talarurus'' are outdated by numerous issues, such as the [[ribs]] pointing to the bottom instead of stick to the sides, as in most ankylosaurs; an inaccurate skull cast which is mainly based on related species and not on the avaible skull material; very displayed arms and legs; four digits on the feet, which in reality only had three as indicated by related ankylosaurines. All of these mistakes were made by anatomical misunderstandings since ankylosaurs were not fully known at that time, also, ''Talarurus'' is not known from a complete skeleton.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Talarurus reconstruction (Maleev, 1952).jpg|thumb|left|''Talarurus'' reconstruction and cervical halfring as in Maleev 1952.

The [[holotype]] specimen '''PIN 557-91''' was discovered in 1948 by the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition, and unearthed from sandy, red calcareous [[claystone]] at the Baynshire locality of the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]]. ''Talarurus'' was described and named by the [[Russia|Russian]] [[paleontologist]] [[Evgeny Maleev]] in [[1952 in paleontology|1952]]. Specimen PIN 557, the original [[holotype]] designated by Maleev, included a fragmentary skull with the posterior part of the skull roof, including the [[occipital region]] and the basicranium, numerous vertebrae, several ribs, a scapulocoracoid, a humerus, a radius, an ulna, a nearly complete manus, a partial ilium, an ischium, a femur, a tibia, a fibula, a nearly complete pes, and assorted armor and scutes.<ref name=Maleev1952>{{cite journal|last1=Maleev|first1=E.

Another presumed characteristics: the [[osteoderms]] had a furrowed ornamentation, making a specially formidable armor, with each plate adorned with additional pleated spines. These were also based on a misunderstanding. These were segments of the halfrings protecting the neck, with their typical low keels. The mount has the further peculiarity that it shows ''Talarurus'' as built like a [[hippopotamus]], with a barrel-shaped thorax, not with the characteristic ankylosaurid low and wide body type, and the forelimbs are strongly splayed. This was caused by an incorrect positioning of the [[ribs]] as if they were appending instead of sticking out sideways; this mistake also prevented a mounting of the wide upper pelvic elements.<ref name=Arbour2014/><ref name=Arbour2015/> \n\n===Size and distinguishing traits===\n[[File:Talarurus size.png|thumb|left|Size comparison between ''Talarurus'' and Maleev, as estimated by Holtz]]\n''Talarurus'' was a medium sized ankylosaur, [[Thomas Holtz]] and [[Gregory S.

Its limbs were robust and short, supporting a wide and rounded belly.<ref name=Maleev1952/><ref name=Park2019/> Diagnoses provided by Maleev 1956 and Tumanova 1987, were of limited utility as they largely listed traits shared with many other ankylosaurids. [[Victoria Arbour|Arbour]] also noted that the foot in fact had three toes. She established a single [[autapomorphy]]: on the frontals, at the middle skull roof, a raised V- shaped region is present. Also she determined that ''Talarurus'' differed from all known ankylosaurids with the exception of the American ''Nodocephalosaurus'' in the possession of caputegulae on the frontals and nasals, that are cone-shaped with a circular base.<ref name=\"Arbour2014\"/> However, according to Parks et al. 2019, ''Talarurus'' can be distinguished based on diverse rostral characteristics, such as the prominent internarial caputegulum, elongated caputegulum, the numerous caputegulae surrounding the nasal area, conical/polygonal-shaped caputegulae, among others.<ref name=Park2019/>\n\n===Skull===\n[[File:Talarurus Skulls.png|thumb|280px|Diagram featuring the most complete skulls, strongly differing from the mounted skeleton cast.

As noted by Arbour and Currie, the skull roof of PIN 3780/1 appears to have slightly different caputegulae (head osteoderms or armour tiles), and that it was unclear if this represents a taxonomic issue.<ref name=Arbour2015/> Nevertheless, all the referred skulls share the same patterns of caputegulae (although little variation among individuals is observable) and therefore referable to the genus.<ref name=Park2019/>\n\nThe most complete skull is MPC-D 100/1354. It nicely preserves the [[Maxilla|maxillary]] rostrum, which is broad and semi-rectangular in shape and fused, no [[teeth]] are found in this zone; probably useful on flat surfaces. As expected, the caputegulae are poligon to tubercle-shaped, with some being present on the nasal area. Each maxilla preserves 23 [[Dental alveolus|alveoli]], however, the teeth were not preserved. Most of the caputegulae present in the top of the head are hexagonal in shape, in the holotype PIN 557-91 some are triangular. The [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbitals]] are strongly armored with some osteoderms behind them. In MPC-D 100/1355 and MPC-D 100/1356 the [[Squamosal bone|squamosal]] and [[Quadratojugal bone|quadratojugal]] [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] are thick and triangular, with the squamosals being more rounded. Usually, the lower jaw remains of ''Talarurus'' do not preserve, however, MPC-D 100/1355 was found in association with a right [[dentary]], very fragmented though.<ref name=Park2019/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Talarurus left feet (Maleev, 1952).jpg|thumb|160px|left|''Talarurus'' foot and osteoderm in Maleev 1952, note the incorrect first digit]]\n[[File:Talarurus.png|thumb|270px|Modern [[Paleoart|life restoration]] by [https://twitter.com/TheWoodParable Jack Wood] 2017, depicted in a more upright posture with a more natural osteoderm and toe configuration]]\nMost of the postcranial remains are known from fragmentary individuals. Based on the PIN 557 specimens, the [[ribs]] are strongly curved and thickened, having a length ranging between {{convert|50|to|100|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. The vertebral area is partially missing, preserving some [[Cervical vertebrae|cervicals]], [[Thoracic vertebrae|dorsals]], [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#caudals|caudals]] and the [[sacrum]]. The cervical vertebrae are amphicoelous (concave on both sides) with thickened [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#centrum|centra]] (body), the [[Vertebra#Structure|neural arches]] are slightly higher. The dorsals have high, wide centra, and they are also amphicoelous with very elongated and robustly built neural arches; some are broken. More complete than the previous sections, the sacrum consists of 4 [[Lumbar vertebrae|presacrals]], 4 [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#S|sacrals]], and the first caudal vertebra, these vertebrae are fused together, with some ribs attached. Their size gradually increases from backward to forwards. Some isolated caudal vertebrae are present, they seem to indicate that the tail consisted of approximately 25 to 30 caudals. The anteriormost caudals have somewhat elongated neural arches and centra, the [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevrons]] are fused and triangle-shaped. In contrast, the posteriormost caudals have very flattened chevrons and neural arches.<ref name=Maleev1952/><ref name=Maleev1956>{{cite journal|last1=Maleev|first1=E.

The [[shoulder girdle]] is represented by a [[scapulocoracoid]] that measures about {{convert|60|cm|mm|abbr=on}} long, [[humerus]], [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]], these elements are very robust compared to other postcrania and they pertain to the left arm. The left scapulocoracoid is very robust with a well developed insertion for the humerus ([[Glenoid cavity|glenoid]]), although the scapular blade is somewhat shortened in length. The humerus is very wide at the ends and thickened measuring {{convert|33.5|cm|mm|abbr=on}} long; it shows some resemblance to that of ''[[Ankylosaurus]]''. Although fragmentary, the [[pelvic girdle]] is represented by a partial and flattened [[illium]] with the [[ischium]]. Hindlimb elements include the right [[femur]] and left [[tibia]]. The preserved femur is straight and strongly robust, the [[greater trochanter]] is fused with the [[lesser trochanter]]; it measures {{convert|47|cm|mm|abbr=on}} long. The tibia however, is more shortened but greatly wide, it has a total length of {{convert|29.8|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. In addition, a [[fibula]] was also preserved, it has a length of {{convert|26.7|cm|mm|abbr=on}}.

Previously it was assumed that as one of the oldest known ankylosaurids, ''Talarurus'' possessed some basal characters that are shared with [[nodosaurids]] but were later lost in more advanced ankylosaurs, such as the presence of four toes. However, the presumed \"primitive\" traits proved to be largely artefacts of the initial skeletal restoration. Recent phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for an assignment of ''Talarurus'' to the [[Ankylosaurinae]], a derived ankylosaurid group. This can be reconciled with its relatively old geological age by the possibility that the Ankylosauridae as a whole appeared much earlier during the [[Early Jurassic]], which must have been true if they were the [[sister group]] of the Nodosauridae in the sense proposed by Coombs in 1978; i.e. if all polacanthines were nodosaurids.<ref name=Coombs1978/><ref name=Arbour2015/>\n\n''Talarurus'' was assigned to the [[Syrmosauridae]] (now known as Ankylosauridae) by Maleev in its original description in 1952.<ref name=Maleev1952/> Walter Preston Coombs suggested that it was the same dinosaur as ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'' although subsequent study did not support this assertion.<ref name=Coombs1978>{{cite journal|last1=Coombs|first1=W.

In some of these ''Talarurus'' was the [[sister species]] of ''Nodocephalosaurus''.<ref name=\"Arbour2014\"/>\n\n==Paleobiology==\nThe 2007 specimen skulls have brought new insights into the neurocranial capacities and dietary habits of ''Talarurus'', specifically the specimen MPC-D 100/1354, which is a well-preserved, almost complete cranium. MPC-D 100/1354 was described in extensive detail along with a very complete skull of ''[[Tarchia]]'' by Paulina-Carabajal et al. 2017, they noted that [[ankylosaurids]] had well-developed [[Emission theory (vision)|gaze stabilization]] and [[Hearing|auditive senses]], differing from [[nodosaurids]], by examining the [[Endocranium|endocranial]] region of the selected specimens. The presence of the [[Flocculus (cerebellar)|flocculus]] was first reported in ''Talarurus'' by Marya\u0144ska<ref name=Marya\u0144ska1977/> and later in other related ankylosaurids, however, this lobe seems to be absent or reduced in nodosaurids. The flocculus is relatively large on most ankylosaurids. Another neuroanatomical character is the elongated [[Lagena (anatomy)|lagena]], which is prominent in ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'', ''Tarchia'' and ''Talarurus''. This anatomical feature indicates that ankylosaurids had a large range of [[Psychoacoustics|sound perception]], specially for [[Low frequency|low frequencies]].<ref name=Paulina-Carabajal2017/> In addition to these findings, the preserved [[Beak|rostrum]] in MPC-D 100/1354 is broad, almost rectangular in shape and somewhat stocky. The wide rostrum of ''Talarurus'' probably worked with efficience on low vegetation at flat terrain. Evidence seems to indicate that ''Talarurus'' had a grazer [[Herbivore|feeding-method]].<ref name=Park2019/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\n[[File:Talarurus and Achillobator.jpg|thumb|Life restoration of a ''Talarurus'' being preyed by an ''Achillobator'' pack]]\nThe fossil remains of ''Talarurus'' have been found in the sediments of [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], which are thought to date from the [[Cenomanian]] to [[Santonian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stages]] of the [[Late Cretaceous]] period, about 102 million to 86 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kurumada|first1=Y.|last2=Aoki|first2=S.|last3=Aoki|first3=K.|last4=Kato|first4=D.|last5=Saneyoshi|first5=M.|last6=Tsogtbaatar|first6=K.|last7=Windley|first7=B.

For instance, ''Talarurus'' had a broad and rectangular snout (or beak), useful for low vegetation, while the one in ''Tsagantegia'' is more elongated and shovel-shaped, useful for high vegetation. In order to illustrate this differentiation strategy, they compared the ankylosaurids to the extant African [[White rhinoceros|white]] and [[Black rhinoceros|black]] rhinoceros: the white rhinoceros is equiped with a broad and rectangular snout, specialized for grazing. The black rhinoceros in the other hand, has a pointed snout for browsing. With these anatomical features and example, it is clear that these taxa were [[Niche differentiation|niche partitioned]].<ref name=Park2019/> Another case of niche partitioning can be observed on the [[therizinosaurs]] ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''Segnosaurus'', taxa that were also discovered in the formation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The first remains of ''Talarurus'' were discovered in 1948 and later described by the Russian paleontologist [[Evgeny Maleev]] with the type species ''T. plicatospineus''. It is known from multiple yet sparce specimens, making it one of the most well known ankylosaurines, along with ''[[Pinacosaurus]]''. Elements from the specimens consists of some bones from the body, however, five skulls have been discovered and assigned to the genus, although the first two were very fragmented.\n\nIt was a medium-sized, heavily built, ground-dwelling, [[quadrupedal]] [[herbivore]], that could grow up to {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and weighed about {{convert|454|to|907|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, nearly a ton. Like other ankylosaurs it had heavy [[armour (zoology)|armour]] and a [[club (zoology)|club]] on its tail, making much of its mobility slow. ''Talarurus'' is classified as a member of the [[Ankylosauria]], in the [[Ankylosaurinae]], a group of derived ankyosaurs. Talarurus is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], being likely niche partitioned with ''[[Tsagantegia]]'', as indicated by its muzzle, which has a rectangular shape specialized for grazing. These represent the oldest known ankylosaurines from Asia, although they are not very closely related to each other. It appears that the closest relative of ''Talarurus'' was ''[[Nodocephalosaurus]]'', an ankylosaurin with similar facial osteoderms.\n\nMost of the skeletal mounts of ''Talarurus'' are outdated by numerous issues, such as the [[ribs]] pointing to the bottom instead of stick to the sides, as in most ankylosaurs; an inaccurate skull cast which is mainly based on related species and not on the avaible skull material; very displayed arms and legs; four digits on the feet, which in reality only had three as indicated by related ankylosaurines. All of these mistakes were made by anatomical misunderstandings since ankylosaurs were not fully known at that time, also, ''Talarurus'' is not known from a complete skeleton.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Talarurus reconstruction (Maleev, 1952).jpg|thumb|left|''Talarurus'' reconstruction and cervical halfring as in Maleev 1952.

Another presumed characteristics: the [[osteoderms]] had a furrowed ornamentation, making a specially formidable armor, with each plate adorned with additional pleated spines. These were also based on a misunderstanding. These were segments of the halfrings protecting the neck, with their typical low keels. The mount has the further peculiarity that it shows ''Talarurus'' as built like a [[hippopotamus]], with a barrel-shaped thorax, not with the characteristic ankylosaurid low and wide body type, and the forelimbs are strongly splayed. This was caused by an incorrect positioning of the [[ribs]] as if they were appending instead of sticking out sideways; this mistake also prevented a mounting of the wide upper pelvic elements.<ref name=Arbour2014/><ref name=Arbour2015/> \n\n===Size and distinguishing traits===\n[[File:Talarurus size.png|thumb|left|Size comparison between ''Talarurus'' and Maleev, as estimated by Holtz]]\n''Talarurus'' was a medium sized ankylosaur, [[Thomas Holtz]] and [[Gregory S.

Its limbs were robust and short, supporting a wide and rounded belly.<ref name=Maleev1952/><ref name=Park2019/> Diagnoses provided by Maleev 1956 and Tumanova 1987, were of limited utility as they largely listed traits shared with many other ankylosaurids. [[Victoria Arbour|Arbour]] also noted that the foot in fact had three toes. She established a single [[autapomorphy]]: on the frontals, at the middle skull roof, a raised V- shaped region is present. Also she determined that ''Talarurus'' differed from all known ankylosaurids with the exception of the American ''Nodocephalosaurus'' in the possession of caputegulae on the frontals and nasals, that are cone-shaped with a circular base.<ref name=\"Arbour2014\"/> However, according to Parks et al. 2019, ''Talarurus'' can be distinguished based on diverse rostral characteristics, such as the prominent internarial caputegulum, elongated caputegulum, the numerous caputegulae surrounding the nasal area, conical/polygonal-shaped caputegulae, among others.<ref name=Park2019/>\n\n===Skull===\n[[File:Talarurus Skulls.png|thumb|280px|Diagram featuring the most complete skulls, strongly differing from the mounted skeleton cast. A) MPC-D 100/1354, B) MPC-D 100/1355 and C) MPC-D 100/1356]]\nThe [[skull]] of ''Talarurus'' measured about {{convert|30|cm|mm}} in total length.<ref name=Park2019/> The holotype, PIN 557-91, is based only on a posterior skull roof<ref name=Marya\u0144ska1977/><ref name=Park2019/>, which features tubercle-like caputegulae (facial osteoderms or armor tiles) that resemble those of ''[[Nodocephalosaurus]]''. As noted by Arbour and Currie, the skull roof of PIN 3780/1 appears to have slightly different caputegulae (head osteoderms or armour tiles), and that it was unclear if this represents a taxonomic issue.<ref name=Arbour2015/> Nevertheless, all the referred skulls share the same patterns of caputegulae (although little variation among individuals is observable) and therefore referable to the genus.<ref name=Park2019/>\n\nThe most complete skull is MPC-D 100/1354. It nicely preserves the [[Maxilla|maxillary]] rostrum, which is broad and semi-rectangular in shape and fused, no [[teeth]] are found in this zone; probably useful on flat surfaces. As expected, the caputegulae are poligon to tubercle-shaped, with some being present on the nasal area. Each maxilla preserves 23 [[Dental alveolus|alveoli]], however, the teeth were not preserved. Most of the caputegulae present in the top of the head are hexagonal in shape, in the holotype PIN 557-91 some are triangular. The [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbitals]] are strongly armored with some osteoderms behind them. In MPC-D 100/1355 and MPC-D 100/1356 the [[Squamosal bone|squamosal]] and [[Quadratojugal bone|quadratojugal]] [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] are thick and triangular, with the squamosals being more rounded. Usually, the lower jaw remains of ''Talarurus'' do not preserve, however, MPC-D 100/1355 was found in association with a right [[dentary]], very fragmented though.<ref name=Park2019/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Talarurus left feet (Maleev, 1952).jpg|thumb|160px|left|''Talarurus'' foot and osteoderm in Maleev 1952, note the incorrect first digit]]\n[[File:Talarurus.png|thumb|270px|Modern [[Paleoart|life restoration]] by [https://twitter.com/TheWoodParable Jack Wood] 2017, depicted in a more upright posture with a more natural osteoderm and toe configuration]]\nMost of the postcranial remains are known from fragmentary individuals.

The vertebral area is partially missing, preserving some [[Cervical vertebrae|cervicals]], [[Thoracic vertebrae|dorsals]], [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#caudals|caudals]] and the [[sacrum]]. The cervical vertebrae are amphicoelous (concave on both sides) with thickened [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#centrum|centra]] (body), the [[Vertebra#Structure|neural arches]] are slightly higher. The dorsals have high, wide centra, and they are also amphicoelous with very elongated and robustly built neural arches; some are broken. More complete than the previous sections, the sacrum consists of 4 [[Lumbar vertebrae|presacrals]], 4 [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#S|sacrals]], and the first caudal vertebra, these vertebrae are fused together, with some ribs attached. Their size gradually increases from backward to forwards. Some isolated caudal vertebrae are present, they seem to indicate that the tail consisted of approximately 25 to 30 caudals. The anteriormost caudals have somewhat elongated neural arches and centra, the [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevrons]] are fused and triangle-shaped. In contrast, the posteriormost caudals have very flattened chevrons and neural arches.<ref name=Maleev1952/><ref name=Maleev1956>{{cite journal|last1=Maleev|first1=E.

The left scapulocoracoid is very robust with a well developed insertion for the humerus ([[Glenoid cavity|glenoid]]), although the scapular blade is somewhat shortened in length. The humerus is very wide at the ends and thickened measuring {{convert|33.5|cm|mm|abbr=on}} long; it shows some resemblance to that of ''[[Ankylosaurus]]''. Although fragmentary, the [[pelvic girdle]] is represented by a partial and flattened [[illium]] with the [[ischium]]. Hindlimb elements include the right [[femur]] and left [[tibia]]. The preserved femur is straight and strongly robust, the [[greater trochanter]] is fused with the [[lesser trochanter]]; it measures {{convert|47|cm|mm|abbr=on}} long. The tibia however, is more shortened but greatly wide, it has a total length of {{convert|29.8|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. In addition, a [[fibula]] was also preserved, it has a length of {{convert|26.7|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. Overall, the fibula is more straight and thin compared to the femur and tibia, its distal end is more wide than the proximal end.<ref name=Maleev1952/><ref name=Maleev1956/>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Ziapelta sanjuanensis 0108804 g005.png|thumb|left|Comparison between the skull of ''Euoplocephalus'' and other North American ankylosaur taxa. Note the presence of ''Nodocephalosaurus'', the close relative of ''Talarurus'']]\n[[File:Ankylosaurin skulls.jpg|thumb|250px|Comparison between the skulls of Laramidian and Asian ankylosaurin taxa]]\nAnkylosaurid phylogenetic relations are hard to determine because many taxa are only partially known, the exact armour configuration has rarely been preserved, fused osteoderms obscure many details of the skull and the Ankylosauridae are conservative in their postcranial skeleton, showing little variation in their vertebrae, pelves and limbs. Previously it was assumed that as one of the oldest known ankylosaurids, ''Talarurus'' possessed some basal characters that are shared with [[nodosaurids]] but were later lost in more advanced ankylosaurs, such as the presence of four toes. However, the presumed \"primitive\" traits proved to be largely artefacts of the initial skeletal restoration. Recent phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for an assignment of ''Talarurus'' to the [[Ankylosaurinae]], a derived ankylosaurid group. This can be reconciled with its relatively old geological age by the possibility that the Ankylosauridae as a whole appeared much earlier during the [[Early Jurassic]], which must have been true if they were the [[sister group]] of the Nodosauridae in the sense proposed by Coombs in 1978; i.e. if all polacanthines were nodosaurids.<ref name=Coombs1978/><ref name=Arbour2015/>\n\n''Talarurus'' was assigned to the [[Syrmosauridae]] (now known as Ankylosauridae) by Maleev in its original description in 1952.<ref name=Maleev1952/> Walter Preston Coombs suggested that it was the same dinosaur as ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'' although subsequent study did not support this assertion.<ref name=Coombs1978>{{cite journal|last1=Coombs|first1=W.

MPC-D 100/1354 was described in extensive detail along with a very complete skull of ''[[Tarchia]]'' by Paulina-Carabajal et al. 2017, they noted that [[ankylosaurids]] had well-developed [[Emission theory (vision)|gaze stabilization]] and [[Hearing|auditive senses]], differing from [[nodosaurids]], by examining the [[Endocranium|endocranial]] region of the selected specimens. The presence of the [[Flocculus (cerebellar)|flocculus]] was first reported in ''Talarurus'' by Marya\u0144ska<ref name=Marya\u0144ska1977/> and later in other related ankylosaurids, however, this lobe seems to be absent or reduced in nodosaurids. The flocculus is relatively large on most ankylosaurids. Another neuroanatomical character is the elongated [[Lagena (anatomy)|lagena]], which is prominent in ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'', ''Tarchia'' and ''Talarurus''. This anatomical feature indicates that ankylosaurids had a large range of [[Psychoacoustics|sound perception]], specially for [[Low frequency|low frequencies]].<ref name=Paulina-Carabajal2017/> In addition to these findings, the preserved [[Beak|rostrum]] in MPC-D 100/1354 is broad, almost rectangular in shape and somewhat stocky. The wide rostrum of ''Talarurus'' probably worked with efficience on low vegetation at flat terrain. Evidence seems to indicate that ''Talarurus'' had a grazer [[Herbivore|feeding-method]].<ref name=Park2019/>\n\n==Paleoecology==\n[[File:Talarurus and Achillobator.jpg|thumb|Life restoration of a ''Talarurus'' being preyed by an ''Achillobator'' pack]]\nThe fossil remains of ''Talarurus'' have been found in the sediments of [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], which are thought to date from the [[Cenomanian]] to [[Santonian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stages]] of the [[Late Cretaceous]] period, about 102 million to 86 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kurumada|first1=Y.|last2=Aoki|first2=S.|last3=Aoki|first3=K.|last4=Kato|first4=D.|last5=Saneyoshi|first5=M.|last6=Tsogtbaatar|first6=K.|last7=Windley|first7=B.

For instance, ''Talarurus'' had a broad and rectangular snout (or beak), useful for low vegetation, while the one in ''Tsagantegia'' is more elongated and shovel-shaped, useful for high vegetation. In order to illustrate this differentiation strategy, they compared the ankylosaurids to the extant African [[White rhinoceros|white]] and [[Black rhinoceros|black]] rhinoceros: the white rhinoceros is equiped with a broad and rectangular snout, specialized for grazing. The black rhinoceros in the other hand, has a pointed snout for browsing. With these anatomical features and example, it is clear that these taxa were [[Niche differentiation|niche partitioned]].<ref name=Park2019/> Another case of niche partitioning can be observed on the [[therizinosaurs]] ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''Segnosaurus'', taxa that were also discovered in the formation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.
