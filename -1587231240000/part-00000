The Main Library campus also includes the Arkansas Studies Institute Building, which includes the offices of the [[Butler Center for Arkansas Studies]], the ''[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture]]'', and the UALR Center for Arkansas History and Culture.  CALS Ron Robinson Theater, Cox Creative Center, and River Market Books & Gifts are also located on the Main Library campus.\n\n==History==\nThe first Little Rock Public Library was one of four [[List of Carnegie libraries in Arkansas|Carnegie Libraries in Arkansas]].  The Carnegie Corporation of New York made a grant of $50,000 in 1906, but increased the grant to $88,100 in 1907.  The library was opened on February 1, 1910, at West 7th Street and South Louisiana Street in downtown Little Rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/carnegie-libraries-6466/|title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=Encyclopedia of Arkansas}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Arkansas Library System (CALS) was born of a 1975 merger agreement between the trustees of the Little Rock Public Library and of the Pulaski-Perry Regional Library; the trustees of the North Little Rock Public Library, now known as the William F. Laman Public Library, chose not to join CALS.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cals.org/about/mission.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502023353/https://www.cals.org/about/mission.aspx |archive-date=2017-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nToday, the Central Arkansas Library System, with its headquarters at the Main Library, serves a local population of 402,853.

She practiced the correct accent and the nuances of the language which later made her one of the most sought after singers in the industry. She was the favorite of many popular music composers like [[V. Dakshinamoorthy|V Dakshinamoorthi]], [[Baburaj|MS Baburaj]], [[Shyam]], [[M. K. Arjunan|MK Arjunan]], [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] Master, [[Raveendran]] Master, [[M. B. Sreenivasan|MB Sreenivasan]], A.T.Ummer, and [[Salil Chowdhury|Salil Choudhary]].\n\nS Janaki went on to sing thousands of songs from early 1960s to mid 80s. She received her first Kerala state film award for best singer in 1970 and went on to win the same almost every year for the next 15 years. It was her command over the language and perfect diction that took her to great heights in Malayalam films. S Janaki is perhaps the only non-Malayali artist who has won maximum awards in Malayalam films.\n\nSome of her hit solo tracks in Malayalam films are:\n* \"Thaliritta Kinaakkal\" [[Moodupadam]] (1963)\n* \"Sooryakaanthi\" [[Kattuthulasi]] (1965)\n* \"Aa Nimishathinte\" [[Chandrakantham]] (1974)\n* \"Unni Arariro\" [[Avalude Ravukal]] (1978)\n* \"Mazhavil Kodi Kavadi\" [[Swapnam]] (1973)\n* \"Unaroo Vegam Nee\" [[Moodalmanju]] (1970)\n* \"Vasantha Panchami Naalil\" [[Bhargavi Nilayam]] (1964)\n* \"Sandhye Kanneerithende\" [[Madanolsavam]] (1978)\n*\"Malarkodi Pole\" [[Vishukkani|Vishukanni]] (1977)\n*\"Mouname Nirayum\" [[Thakara]] (1980)\n* \"Naadha Neevarum Kaalocha\" [[Chamaram]] (1980)\n* \"Thumbi Vaa Thumbakudathin\" [[Olangal]] (1982)\n*\"Moham Kondu Njan\" [[Sesham Kazhchayil|Shesham Kazhchayil]] (1985)\n* \"Thenum Vayambum\" [[Thenum Vayambum]] (1981)\n*\"Olathumbathirunnu\" [[Pappayude Swantham Appoos|Pappayude swantham Appose]] (1992)\n*\"Swarna Mukile\" [[Ithu Njangalude Katha]] (1982)\n*\"Konchi Karayalle\" [[Poomukhappadiyil Ninneyum Kaathu|Poomukha padiyil ninneyum kaathu]] (1986)\n*\"Kaikkudanna Niraye\" [[Maya Mayooram|Mayamayooram]] (1993)\n*\"Sarapoli Mala\" [[April 19 (film)|April 19]] (1996)\n*\"Amma Poovinum\" [[10 Kalpanakal]] (2016)<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch S Janaki's last song Ammapoovinum from Malayalam movie 10 Kalpanakal |url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/watch-janakis-last-song-ammapoovinum-074221813.html |work=in.news.yahoo.com |language=en-IN}}</ref>\n\n===Tamil films===\nS Janaki sang her first Tamil song in 1957. The song ''Singaravelane Deva'' from the movie ''Konjum Salangai'' brought her to limelight in Tamil films. [[M. S. Viswanathan|M S Viswanathan]] gave her many hit songs every year throughout 60s and early 70s. It was the song ''Unnidathil ennaik kodutthen'' [[Avalukendru Oru Manam]] (1971) that consolidated her position as the most promising singer thereafter.\n\nShe sang many songs under many famous composers. [[Ilaiyaraaja]] - [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam|SP Balasubramanyam]]- S Janaki combination gave hit after hit from mid 1970s till 1990s. S Janaki is the only singer who has won state awards under the oft-called top three music composers of the state ([[M. S. Viswanathan|MS Vishwanathan]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]] and [[A. R. Rahman|AR Rahman]]).\n\nSome of her best solos in Tamil cinema are:\n* \"Singara Velane deva\" [[Konjum Salangai]] (1962)\n* \n*Sendhoora Poove\" [[16 Vayathinile]] (1977)\n* \"Kuyile Kavikkuyile\" [[Kavikkuyil]] (1977)\n* \"Annakkili Unnai\" [[Annakkili]] (1976)\n* \"Kaatril Endhan\" [[Johnny (1980 film)|Johnny]] (1980)\n* \"Ponmeni Urugudhe\" [[Moondram Pirai]] (1982)\n*\"Azhagu Malaraada\"''[[Vaidhegi Kaathirunthaal]]'' (1984) \n*\n* \"Chinna Chinna Vannakuyil\" [[Mouna Ragam]] (1986)\n* \"Ooru Sanam\" [[Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu]] (1986)\n*\n* \"Chinna Thayaval\" [[Thalapathi]] (1991)\n* \"Aasai Athigam Vechu''\"[[Marupadiyum]](1993)''\n*Margazhi Thingal Allava\" [[Sangamam]] (1999)\n\n===Telugu films===\nS Janaki started her career in Telugu films in 1957. Movies like ''Bava maradalu'', ''Pooja Phalam'' and ''Bangaru Panjaram'' had songs by S Janaki which were immensely popular. She gave continuous hits throughout 1960s and 70s. She continued to give hits till mid 90s.

He decided to have songs sung by her in his upcoming Hindi movies and introduced her to Bollywood.<ref name=\"YouTube\"/> She sang many duets with [[Kishore Kumar]].\n\nSome of her notable Hindi songs are\n* \"Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Aayaa jab se tu dil mein\" [[Jhoothi]] (1985)\n* \"Jawan Hai Dil Jawan Hain Hum\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Sun Rubia Tumse Pyar Ho Gaya\" [[Mard (1985 film)|Mard]] (1985)\n* \"Mamla Gadbad Hai\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Aankhen do\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Tune mera doodh piya\" [[Aakhree Raasta]] (1986)\n* \"Pag Paadam\" [[Naache Mayuri]](1986)\n* \"Dil mein ho tum\" [[Satyamev Jayate (film)|Satyamev Jayate]] (1987)\n* \"Main tere liye\" [[Main Tere Liye]] (1989)\n* \"Poocho Na Kysa Maza\" [[Awwal Number]] (1990)\n\n===Oriya films===\nS Janaki sang many evergreen songs in Oriya. She has sung about 68 songs in Odia films. Her songs are still popular today and she also won 1 [[Orissa State Film Award]].\n\n===Other languages===\n\nS Janaki sang songs in 17 languages, though her top hits were in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu.  She also sang a few songs in other languages. 109 Hindi songs, 68 Odia songs, 4 Sinhalese songs, 2 Tulu songs, 1 Badaga song, 2 Sanskrit songs, 1 Punjabi song...\n* One Japanese song in [[Adutha Veettu Penn]] (1960)\n* One German song in [[Puthu Paatu]] (1990)\n* One English song in [[Swayamkrushi]] (1986).\n\n==Collaboration with Music Directors==\n\nS Janaki has worked with music directors of different generations. From the early 1960s she was given songs by composers mainly in Kannada and Malayalam films.Though she sang fewer songs in Telugu and Tamil during the beginning of her career she went on to rule the playback industry across all four south Indian languages from mid 1970s.\n\n===G. K. Venkatesh===\n[[G. K. Venkatesh]] was one of the early composers who brought a renaissance in Kannada film music.\nHe started composing for more films from early 1960s and went on to give some remarkable songs to Janaki. GKV-SJ-PBS combination was the talk of the town those days.\nTwo songs which need special mention from this combination are \"nambide ninna naadhadevate\" from Sandhya Raga and \"Karedaru kelade\" from Sanaadi Appanna: both became very popular.\n\n===Ilaiyaraaja===\n[[Ilaiyaraaja]] knew about Janaki's vocal range and versatility when he worked with G K Venkatesh. When he got a chance to compose music for his debut film [[Annakkili]] (1976) he made Janaki sing 3 songs which became immensely popular thus beginning an era in Tamil cinema. This combination churned out hits after hits pushing S Janaki to the numero uno position for at least the next 2 decades. S Janaki won 4 state awards in Tamil in his compositions. He explored her voice in wide variety of songs and she became the first choice for songs with village background.\n\nShe sang maximum duets with Balasubramanium, Malaysia Vasudevan, Mano, Yesudas, Jayachandran. Ilayaraaja himself sang around 200 duets with Janaki; most were chart busters. After IR started giving more songs to SJ, even other music composers followed by making her sing their top hits.\n\nSPB-IR-SJ created some of the finest duets of Tamil cinemas. 1980s saw the meteoric rise of Janaki with a strong back up from Ilayaraja, as she sang his songs in all four South Indian languages.\n\n===M. S. Baburaj===\nThe earliest recognised collaboration of S Janaki's was with the Malayalam composer [[MS Baburaj]], who specialised in Hindustani music. Under his direction, Janaki was able to give voice to some of Kerala's best loved film songs of all time during the 1960s and early 1970s. The songs they've worked on have been known for their outward expressions, both in voice and the composition by itself. Some of Janaki's best known solos come from this collaboration, including ''Vasantha Panchami Naalil'' ([[Bhargavi Nilayam]]), ''Anjana Kannezhuthi'' ([[Thacholi Othenan]]), and ''Thaane Thirinjum Marinjum'' ([[Ambalapravu]]).\n\n===Rajan\u2013Nagendra===\nRajan and Nagendra have a unique place in hearts of Kannada music lovers.\nS Janaki was a part of almost all their albums. During the initial days, RN gave many duets to PBS-SJ. Later their main singers were SPB and S Janaki.  Almost all of their songs remain etched as the unforgettable melodies of Kannada Cinema. The romantic duets that came out from the SPB-S Janaki-[[Rajan-Nagendra]] combination are considered to be heavenly and evergreen. Radios called the pair of SPB and S Janaki as \"Love Birds\" and are termed to be the \"Best singing pair\" in Kannada cinema, owing mainly to their romantic duets composed by Rajan-Nagendra in the 1970s and 80s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjanaki.net/kannada/with-spb|title=sjanaki.net|website=www.sjanaki.net}}</ref>\nIn terms of numbers it was Rajan-Nagendra who gave maximum songs to Janaki after Ilaiyaraaja. \nThe solos and duets that S Janaki rendered under these music composers can never be erased from the minds of Kannada audience. Some top hit songs came from movies such as Eradu Kanasu, Hombisilu,  Gaali Maathu, Pavana Ganga, Avala Hejje, Chandana Gombe,  Naa Ninna Bidalare and the list continues.\n\n===Hamsalekha===\nBy the end of 80s [[Hamsalekha]] established himself as the top music composer in Kannada cinema pushing all the veteran composers to the background. His strong association with actor Ravichandran resulted in so many hit songs. S Janaki was his first choice during the initial days of his career. SPB-SJ-HL created some of the evergreen duets in movies like [[Premaloka]] and [[Ranadheera]].\nS Janaki worked in more than 40 films with Hamsalekha and sang all-time hit solos and duets.\n\n===Vijaya Bhaskar===\nKannada cinema offered SJ real gems of her singing career and [[Vijaya Bhaskar]] is no exception. Though his main singers were P Susheela in 60s and Vani Jayaram and Chitra in 70s and 80s, he gave some of his best compositions to S Janaki in movies like [[Gejje Pooje]], [[Bellimoda]], [[Upasane]], [[Seetha (1970 film)]]; he chose her whenever the song needed some special singing. \"Gaganavu ello bhoomiyu ello\" remains one of the most memorable songs of S Janaki. If we take the top 10 songs of S Janaki in Kannada cinema there would definitely be at least 2 songs composed by Bhaskar.\n\n===A. R. Rahman===\nDuring 90's Janaki sang many great Tamil songs for [[A.R.Rahman|A. R. Rahman]] at the early stage of his career. Songs like \"Ottagatha Kattiko\", \"Gopala Gopala\", \"Nenjinele\", \"Kadhal Kaditham Theetave\", \"Mudhalvane\", \"Kathirika\", \"Endhan Nenjil\", \"Margazhi Thinkal\" and many are still popular. She won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback]] for Margazhi Thinkal allava from the film [[Sangamam]] under his composition.\n\n==Legacy & popularity==\nJanaki and voice modulation is synonymous. She has done a wide range of voice modulation according to the age of the character in all four South Indian languages.\nShe is perhaps the only singer who won state awards for the same. Tamil Nadu state award for \"Poda poda pokka\" song from [[Uthiripookkal]] (1978) and Andhra Pradesh State award for \"Govullu tellana\" song from [[Saptapadi (1981 film)]]. Songs she sang in kids-voice in 70s in Kannada too were popular, one such song is \"Thayiya thandeya\" from the film [[Madhura Sangama]](1978). She sang many such songs for 3 year old, young boy, goatish voice, male voice and voice of aged woman. She sung more than 100 such songs across all languages.\n\n===Toughest song===\nJanaki says that the toughest song of her singing career is the fastest swaras [[Kannada]] song \"Shiva shiva ennada naaligeyeke\" from the movie ''[[Hemavathi_(film)]]''. The song, which is in two different ragas, ''Thodi'' and ''Aabhogi'', was composed by L. Vaidyanathan.<ref name=\"dbsjeyaraj.com\">{{cite web|url=http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/15504|title=South Indian Singer S.Janaki Explains why She is not Accepting the \"Padma

She practiced the correct accent and the nuances of the language which later made her one of the most sought after singers in the industry. She was the favorite of many popular music composers like [[V. Dakshinamoorthy|V Dakshinamoorthi]], [[Baburaj|MS Baburaj]], [[Shyam]], [[M. K. Arjunan|MK Arjunan]], [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] Master, [[Raveendran]] Master, [[M. B. Sreenivasan|MB Sreenivasan]], A.T.Ummer, and [[Salil Chowdhury|Salil Choudhary]].\n\nS Janaki went on to sing thousands of songs from early 1960s to mid 80s. She received her first Kerala state film award for best singer in 1970 and went on to win the same almost every year for the next 15 years. It was her command over the language and perfect diction that took her to great heights in Malayalam films. S Janaki is perhaps the only non-Malayali artist who has won maximum awards in Malayalam films.\n\nSome of her hit solo tracks in Malayalam films are:\n* \"Thaliritta Kinaakkal\" [[Moodupadam]] (1963)\n* \"Sooryakaanthi\" [[Kattuthulasi]] (1965)\n* \"Aa Nimishathinte\" [[Chandrakantham]] (1974)\n* \"Unni Arariro\" [[Avalude Ravukal]] (1978)\n* \"Mazhavil Kodi Kavadi\" [[Swapnam]] (1973)\n* \"Unaroo Vegam Nee\" [[Moodalmanju]] (1970)\n* \"Vasantha Panchami Naalil\" [[Bhargavi Nilayam]] (1964)\n* \"Sandhye Kanneerithende\" [[Madanolsavam]] (1978)\n*\"Malarkodi Pole\" [[Vishukkani|Vishukanni]] (1977)\n*\"Mouname Nirayum\" [[Thakara]] (1980)\n* \"Naadha Neevarum Kaalocha\" [[Chamaram]] (1980)\n* \"Thumbi Vaa Thumbakudathin\" [[Olangal]] (1982)\n*\"Moham Kondu Njan\" [[Sesham Kazhchayil|Shesham Kazhchayil]] (1985)\n* \"Thenum Vayambum\" [[Thenum Vayambum]] (1981)\n*\"Olathumbathirunnu\" [[Pappayude Swantham Appoos|Pappayude swantham Appose]] (1992)\n*\"Swarna Mukile\" [[Ithu Njangalude Katha]] (1982)\n*\"Konchi Karayalle\" [[Poomukhappadiyil Ninneyum Kaathu|Poomukha padiyil ninneyum kaathu]] (1986)\n*\"Kaikkudanna Niraye\" [[Maya Mayooram|Mayamayooram]] (1993)\n*\"Sarapoli Mala\" [[April 19 (film)|April 19]] (1996)\n*\"Amma Poovinum\" [[10 Kalpanakal]] (2016)<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch S Janaki's last song Ammapoovinum from Malayalam movie 10 Kalpanakal |url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/watch-janakis-last-song-ammapoovinum-074221813.html |work=in.news.yahoo.com |language=en-IN}}</ref>\n\n===Tamil films===\nS Janaki sang her first Tamil song in 1957. The song ''Singaravelane Deva'' from the movie ''Konjum Salangai'' brought her to limelight in Tamil films. [[M. S. Viswanathan|M S Viswanathan]] gave her many hit songs every year throughout 60s and early 70s. It was the song ''Unnidathil ennaik kodutthen'' [[Avalukendru Oru Manam]] (1971) that consolidated her position as the most promising singer thereafter.\n\nShe sang many songs under many famous composers. [[Ilaiyaraaja]] - [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam|SP Balasubramanyam]]- S Janaki combination gave hit after hit from mid 1970s till 1990s. S Janaki is the only singer who has won state awards under the oft-called top three music composers of the state ([[M. S. Viswanathan|MS Vishwanathan]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]] and [[A. R. Rahman|AR Rahman]]).\n\nSome of her best solos in Tamil cinema are:\n* \"Singara Velane deva\" [[Konjum Salangai]] (1962)\n* \n*Sendhoora Poove\" [[16 Vayathinile]] (1977)\n* \"Kuyile Kavikkuyile\" [[Kavikkuyil]] (1977)\n* \"Annakkili Unnai\" [[Annakkili]] (1976)\n* \"Kaatril Endhan\" [[Johnny (1980 film)|Johnny]] (1980)\n* \"Ponmeni Urugudhe\" [[Moondram Pirai]] (1982)\n*\"Azhagu Malaraada\"''[[Vaidhegi Kaathirunthaal]]'' (1984) \n*\n* \"Chinna Chinna Vannakuyil\" [[Mouna Ragam]] (1986)\n* \"Ooru Sanam\" [[Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu]] (1986)\n*\n* \"Chinna Thayaval\" [[Thalapathi]] (1991)\n* \"Aasai Athigam Vechu''\"[[Marupadiyum]](1993)''\n*Margazhi Thingal Allava\" [[Sangamam]] (1999)\n\n===Telugu films===\nS Janaki started her career in Telugu films in 1957. Movies like ''Bava maradalu'', ''Pooja Phalam'' and ''Bangaru Panjaram'' had songs by S Janaki which were immensely popular. She gave continuous hits throughout 1960s and 70s. She continued to give hits till mid 90s. S Janaki has won 12 Nandi awards, 10 for films and 2 for television serial songs.A few of her solos are:\n\n* \"Neeli Meghalalo\" Bava Maradallu (1961)\n* \"Naravara O Kuruvara\" [[Nartanasala]] (1963)\n* \"Pagale Vennela\" [[Pooja Phalam]] (1964)\n* \"Pagalaite Doravera\" [[Bangaru Panjaram]] (1970)\n* \"Sirimallepoova\" [[Padaharella Vayasu]] (1978)\n* \"Nemaliki Nerpina\" [[Saptapadi]] (1981)\n* \"Om Namah Shivaaya\" [[Sagara Sangamam]] (1983)\n* \"Ee Dhuryodhana\" [[Pratighatana]] (1985)\n* \"Narudaa O Narudaa\" [[Bhairava Dweepam]] (1994)\n\n===Hindi films===\nComposer [[Bappi Lahiri]] was impressed by a Hindi song sung by S Janaki for a Tamil movie, when he visited [[Prasad Studios|Prasad Studio]]. He decided to have songs sung by her in his upcoming Hindi movies and introduced her to Bollywood.<ref name=\"YouTube\"/> She sang many duets with [[Kishore Kumar]].\n\nSome of her notable Hindi songs are\n* \"Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Aayaa jab se tu dil mein\" [[Jhoothi]] (1985)\n* \"Jawan Hai Dil Jawan Hain Hum\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Sun Rubia Tumse Pyar Ho Gaya\" [[Mard (1985 film)|Mard]] (1985)\n* \"Mamla Gadbad Hai\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Aankhen do\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Tune mera doodh piya\" [[Aakhree Raasta]] (1986)\n* \"Pag Paadam\" [[Naache Mayuri]](1986)\n* \"Dil mein ho tum\" [[Satyamev Jayate (film)|Satyamev Jayate]] (1987)\n* \"Main tere liye\" [[Main Tere Liye]] (1989)\n* \"Poocho Na Kysa Maza\" [[Awwal Number]] (1990)\n\n===Oriya films===\nS Janaki sang many evergreen songs in Oriya. She has sung about 68 songs in Odia films. Her songs are still popular today and she also won 1 [[Orissa State Film Award]].\n\n===Other languages===\n\nS Janaki sang songs in 17 languages, though her top hits were in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu.  She also sang a few songs in other languages. 109 Hindi songs, 68 Odia songs, 4 Sinhalese songs, 2 Tulu songs, 1 Badaga song, 2 Sanskrit songs, 1 Punjabi song...\n* One Japanese song in [[Adutha Veettu Penn]] (1960)\n* One German song in [[Puthu Paatu]] (1990)\n* One English song in [[Swayamkrushi]] (1986).\n\n==Collaboration with Music Directors==\n\nS Janaki has worked with music directors of different generations. From the early 1960s she was given songs by composers mainly in Kannada and Malayalam films.Though she sang fewer songs in Telugu and Tamil during the beginning of her career she went on to rule the playback industry across all four south Indian languages from mid 1970s.\n\n===G. K. Venkatesh===\n[[G. K. Venkatesh]] was one of the early composers who brought a renaissance in Kannada film music.\nHe started composing for more films from early 1960s and went on to give some remarkable songs to Janaki. GKV-SJ-PBS combination was the talk of the town those days.\nTwo songs which need special mention from this combination are \"nambide ninna naadhadevate\" from Sandhya Raga and \"Karedaru kelade\" from Sanaadi Appanna: both became very popular.\n\n===Ilaiyaraaja===\n[[Ilaiyaraaja]] knew about Janaki's vocal range and versatility when he worked with G K Venkatesh. When he got a chance to compose music for his debut film [[Annakkili]] (1976) he made Janaki sing 3 songs which became immensely popular thus beginning an era in Tamil cinema. This combination churned out hits after hits pushing S Janaki to the numero uno position for at least the next 2 decades. S Janaki won 4 state awards in Tamil in his compositions. He explored her voice in wide variety of songs and she became the first choice for songs with village background.\n\nShe sang maximum duets with Balasubramanium, Malaysia Vasudevan, Mano, Yesudas, Jayachandran. Ilayaraaja himself sang around 200 duets with Janaki; most were chart busters. After IR started giving more songs to SJ, even other music composers followed by making her sing their top hits.\n\nSPB-IR-SJ created some of the finest duets of Tamil cinemas. 1980s saw the meteoric rise of Janaki with a strong back up from Ilayaraja, as she sang his songs in all four South Indian languages.\n\n===M. S. Baburaj===\nThe earliest recognised collaboration of S Janaki's was with the Malayalam composer [[MS Baburaj]], who specialised in Hindustani music. Under his direction, Janaki was able to give voice to some of Kerala's best loved film songs of all time during the 1960s and early 1970s. The songs they've worked on have been known for their outward expressions, both in voice and the composition by itself. Some of Janaki's best known solos come from this collaboration, including ''Vasantha Panchami Naalil'' ([[Bhargavi Nilayam]]), ''Anjana Kannezhuthi'' ([[Thacholi Othenan]]), and ''Thaane Thirinjum Marinjum'' ([[Ambalapravu]]).\n\n===Rajan\u2013Nagendra===\nRajan and Nagendra have a unique place in hearts of Kannada music lovers.\nS Janaki was a part of almost all their albums. During the initial days, RN gave many duets to PBS-SJ. Later their main singers were SPB and S Janaki.  Almost all of their songs remain etched as the unforgettable melodies of Kannada Cinema. The romantic duets that came out from the SPB-S Janaki-[[Rajan-Nagendra]] combination are considered to be heavenly and evergreen. Radios called the pair of SPB and S Janaki as \"Love Birds\" and are termed to be the \"Best singing pair\" in Kannada cinema, owing mainly to their romantic duets composed by Rajan-Nagendra in the 1970s and 80s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjanaki.net/kannada/with-spb|title=sjanaki.net|website=www.sjanaki.net}}</ref>\nIn terms of numbers it was Rajan-Nagendra who gave maximum songs to Janaki after Ilaiyaraaja. \nThe solos and duets that S Janaki rendered under these music composers can never be erased from the minds of Kannada audience. Some top hit songs came from movies such as Eradu Kanasu, Hombisilu,  Gaali Maathu, Pavana Ganga, Avala Hejje, Chandana Gombe,  Naa Ninna Bidalare and the list continues.\n\n===Hamsalekha===\nBy the end of 80s [[Hamsalekha]] established himself as the top music composer in Kannada cinema pushing all the veteran composers to the background. His strong association with actor Ravichandran resulted in so many hit songs. S Janaki was his first choice during the initial days of his career. SPB-SJ-HL created some of the evergreen duets in movies like [[Premaloka]] and [[Ranadheera]].\nS Janaki worked in more than 40 films with Hamsalekha and sang all-time hit solos and duets.\n\n===Vijaya Bhaskar===\nKannada cinema offered SJ real gems of her singing career and [[Vijaya Bhaskar]] is no exception. Though his main singers were P Susheela in 60s and Vani Jayaram and Chitra in 70s and 80s, he gave some of his best compositions to S Janaki in movies like [[Gejje Pooje]], [[Bellimoda]], [[Upasane]], [[Seetha (1970 film)]]; he chose her whenever the song needed some special singing. \"Gaganavu ello bhoomiyu ello\" remains one of the most memorable songs of S Janaki. If we take the top 10 songs of S Janaki in Kannada cinema there would definitely be at least 2 songs composed by Bhaskar.\n\n===A. R. Rahman===\nDuring 90's Janaki sang many great Tamil songs for [[A.R.Rahman|A. R. Rahman]] at the early stage of his career. Songs like \"Ottagatha Kattiko\", \"Gopala Gopala\", \"Nenjinele\", \"Kadhal Kaditham Theetave\", \"Mudhalvane\", \"Kathirika\", \"Endhan Nenjil\", \"Margazhi Thinkal\" and many are still popular. She won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback]] for Margazhi Thinkal allava from the film [[Sangamam]] under his composition.\n\n==Legacy & popularity==\nJanaki and voice modulation is synonymous. She has done a wide range of voice modulation according to the age of the character in all four South Indian languages.\nShe is perhaps the only singer who won state awards for the same. Tamil Nadu state award for \"Poda poda pokka\" song from [[Uthiripookkal]] (1978) and Andhra Pradesh State award for \"Govullu tellana\" song from [[Saptapadi (1981 film)]]. Songs she sang in kids-voice in 70s in Kannada too were popular, one such song is \"Thayiya thandeya\" from the film [[Madhura Sangama]](1978). She sang many such songs for 3 year old, young boy, goatish voice, male voice and voice of aged woman. She sung more than 100 such songs across all languages.\n\n===Toughest song===\nJanaki says that the toughest song of her singing career is the fastest swaras [[Kannada]] song \"Shiva shiva ennada naaligeyeke\" from the movie ''[[Hemavathi_(film)]]''. The song, which is in two different ragas, ''Thodi'' and ''Aabhogi'', was composed by L. Vaidyanathan.<ref name=\"dbsjeyaraj.com\">{{cite web|url=http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/15504|title=South Indian Singer S.Janaki Explains why She is not Accepting the \"Padma

It was created to coincide with the [[Lego Ninjago]] line of construction toys, many of which are based on elements of the series. It centers on the fictional world of Ninjago, telling the story of a group of teenage [[Ninja]] and their battles against the forces of evil. The series was animated in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Wil Film ApS for the first ten seasons, subtitled \"Masters of Spinjitzu\". Animation was relocated to [[WildBrain|WildBrain Studios]] in Canada starting with the eleventh season. The English-language voice cast has been recorded in Canada for its entire run. As of 2020 it is the longest currently running series airing on Cartoon Network. \n\n''Ninjago'' began with two pilot episodes in January 2011, which were followed by two 13-episode seasons that aired from January to November 2012. Both the Lego theme and the series had an intended shelf life of three years, so the second season was originally intended to be the last. However, continued success of the series and its product line led to the show continuing ever since with twelve seasons being produced as of 2020.\n\nThe series was created by Michael Hegner and Tommy Andreasen, two Danish film producers. In Denmark, where the series' original production companies are located, ''Ninjago'' premiered on [[Nickelodeon (Denmark)|Nickelodeon]]. It airs on various Nickelodeon networks internationally and on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States, United Kingdom and Poland. In [[Canada]], the series is broadcast on [[Teletoon]] and [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]].<ref name=teletoon>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2012/08/pr-teletoon-programming-highlights-september-2012/|title=PR: TELETOON Programming Highlights, September 2012|work=toonzone.net}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe show is mainly set in the [[realm]] of Ninjago, a place loosely inspired by [[East Asian culture|East Asian myths and culture]]. While featuring several historically designed buildings and traditional clothing, Ninjago is in a modern setting, incorporating large metropolises with skyscrapers, current-age (and futuristic) vehicles, modern electronics, semi-robotic exo-suits, and other futuristic technology.\n\n==Synopsis==\nLong before the events of the series, the First Spinjitzu Master used the power of the Golden Weapons to create the realm of Ninjago. Trained in the legendary art of Spinjitzu by the wise Master Wu, a group of heroic ninja (Kai, Jay, Cole, and Zane, and eventually Lloyd and Nya) fight to defend their land against the various foes who wish to conquer it.\n\n===Pilot Episodes (2011)===\nLong before time had a name, the First Spinjitzu Master created the [[realm]] of [[Ninjago]] with the four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu: the Scythe of Quakes, the Shurikens of Ice, the Nunchucks of Lightning, and the Sword of Fire. Before he passed, his sons swore to protect the weapons from evil, but the older brother, Garmadon, was taken over by darkness and aimed to wield all four weapons so he could recreate Ninjago in his own image. In the ensuing battle between brothers, the younger brother Wu cast Garmadon down to the Underworld, hiding the weapons across the land and placing a guardian at each hiding spot. In anticipation of Garmadon's return, Wu seeks out four talented young Ninja to learn the ways of the Ninja, master the art of Spinjitzu, and find the Golden Weapons before Garmadon and his minions can claim them for their maniacal machinations.\n\n===Season 1: Rise of the Serpentine (2012)===\nSince Lord Garmadon's disappearance, peace has returned to Ninjago. Rather than prepare for his return, the Ninja have become lazy, playing video games and eating junk food instead of continuing their training. With their guard down, they find themselves thrown back into action when Garmadon's son Lloyd releases the five warring tribes of Serpentine, a race of snake-people who once ruled over Ninjago before being sealed away in underground tombs. Now led by the treacherous Pythor P. Chumsworth, last of the fearsome Anacondrai, the vengeful snakes seek to find the four Silver Fangblades to awaken the Great Devourer, an indestructible giant serpent that grows the more it consumes. Its name is \"The Great Devouer\".  To stop them, the Ninja make new allies as they try to overcome emotional barriers and unlock their True Potential and trying to learn the identity of the legendary Green Ninja spoken of in a prophecy.\n\n===Season 2: The Final Battle (2012) ===\nMore commonly known as \u201cThe Legacy of The Green Ninja\u201d.\nAfter defeating the Great Devourer, Lord Garmadon has escaped with the Golden Weapons and taken command of the Serpentine. At the Golden Peaks, birthplace of the weapons, he forges them into a Mega Weapon. Able to create anything he pleases, Garmadon aims to interrupt Lloyd's training and prevent him from achieving his destiny as the Green Ninja. To ensure Lloyd is ready to face his father, the Ninja combat Garmadon's creations at every turn. But both sides are unaware of an evil dwelling on the fabled Island of Darkness pulling the strings for thousands of years to conquer all. The fate of Ninjago hangs in the balance as the Final Battle between good and evil looms closer.\n\n===Season 3: Rebooted (2014)===\nGood prevailed in the Final Battle with Lloyd as the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master defeating the Overlord and saving both Ninjago and his father. Ninjago City was left in ruin until genius inventor Cyrus Borg led the reconstruction process bringing about New Ninjago City, a hub of futuristic technological advancements. In this hi-tech age of peace, the Ninja have retired to teaching at Wu's Academy. During a field trip to Borg Tower, center of all this innovation, they discover that the Overlord has survived his fight with the Golden Ninja in the form of a virus, infecting Borg's systems. To escape the Digiverse, he plots to steal Lloyd's Golden Power and become a prophesized evil known as the Golden Master. Leaving Lloyd under the protection of a now pacifistic Garmadon, the Ninja must find the hard-drive containing the Digital Overlord and reboot the system with Borg's tech-hacking Techno Blades, to keep their friend safe and put an end to the Overlord's evil once and for all.\n\n===Season 4: The Tournament of Elements (2015)===\nTo defeat the Golden Master, Zane was forced to absorb power from the Golden Armor, sacrificing his life and leaving the Ninja team fractured in the process. But when notorious crime boss and noodle house owner Master Chen invites them to his Tournament of Elements; a competition between other Elemental Masters like them, with the promise of seeing Zane again, the Ninja, accompanied by Garmadon, find themselves traveling to Chen's Island and quickly making enemies. However, when they discover that Chen and his cult of Anacondrai worshippers use the Staff of Elements to strip those who lose of their Elemental Powers for a spell that could restart a war from Ninjago's past, they attempt to form an alliance with the Elemental Masters.\n\n===Season 5: Possession (2015)===\nChen and his Anacondrai Cultists have been banished to the Cursed Realm by General Arcturus and the Anacondrai Generals. But to free the generals, Garmadon had to take their place amongst the cursed. As a distraught Lloyd mourns the loss of his father, he is called to a solo mission where he is possessed by the jealous ghost of Wu's first student Morro, the Master of Wind, who escaped the Cursed Realm when Garmadon opened the portal. Now, the powerless Ninja face their friend as Morro aims to find the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master and use the Realm Crystal, gateway to the Sixteen Realms parallel to Ninjago, to allow his master to curse all that exists. To stop him, the Ninja ally with mercenary and shady businessman Ronin, mastering the lost art of Airjitzu and following three clues to the tomb's location engraved on Wu's staff. But the true key to victory lies with Nya, who learns she is the current Master of Water, which happens to be a ghost's greatest weakness and Nya finds her true potential.\n\n===Season 6: Skybound (2016)===\nTheir victory over the Preeminent has brought the Ninja overwhelming fame. While they struggle to continue to defend Ninjago while warding off obsessed fans, Jay tangles with seeing a future with Nya in the First Spinjitzu Master's Tomb. Things go further downhill for the heroes when the ghost of Chen's right-hand man Clouse (who survived the destruction of the Cursed Realm) releases Nadakhan the Djinn, the captain of the Misfortune's Keep and Sky Pirates. Framing the Ninja and reuniting with his crew, Nadakhan learns that the destruction of the Cursed Realm has caused the collapse of its Sister Realm and his former home and kingdom of Djinjago. With their fans turned against them and their team dwindling in numbers as the Djinn turns their wishes against them to trap them in his Sword of Souls, the Ninja find themselves in a battle across Ninjago to stop a vengeful Nadakhan from rebuilding his Realm with chunks of theirs. But when he sets his eyes on marrying Nya, a love-struck Jay must find the right wish to save his love, home, and friends.\n\n===Day of the Departed (2016)===\nOn the Day of the Departed, the people of Ninjago light lanterns to remember those they've lost. While his friends celebrate, Cole, whose ghostly state has deteriorated to the point of him randomly fading in and out of existence, intends to exact revenge on Master Yang for turning him into a ghost during the Ninja's attempt to learn Airjitzu. Commandeering the Yin Blade, a dark magic weapon Yang once used in an attempt to gain immortality, Cole enters the Temple of Airjitzu and prepares to \"close the circle\" by defeating the Airjitzu Master. But when his gambit for revenge leads to the accidental revival of some of the Ninja's greatest enemies, the heroes find themselves facing their vengeful foes once again as they attempt to take the Ninja's place amongst the living using magic Departed Blades. Meanwhile, Cole faces Yang and his students alone as, thanks to his actions, the Airjitzu Master has reclaimed the Yin Blade and plots to take advantage of a special Yin Yang Eclipse to cut the Rift of Return which will allow him to return to the living world.\n\n===Season 7: The Hands of Time (2017)===\nFollowing the events on the Day of the Departed, both Cole and the Temple of Airjitzu have been restored. As the Ninja setup base in the temple, they find themselves stuck cleaning up the damage at the Ninjago Museum of History. Here, they learn of the Hands of Time, twin Elemental Masters of Time itself who betrayed the Elemental Masters after the Serpentine Wars in belief their Element was the strongest. Meanwhile, at the ruins of the Monastery of Spinjitzu, Wu awaits the return of Acronix, the younger of the \"Time Twins\", to finish the battle they started 40 years ago. But without the rest of the team by his side, Wu is overwhelmed by Acronix who uses a move known as the \"Time Punch\" to accelerate Wu's aging one day per hour. Now Acronix has reunited with Krux, the older twin, who has remained hidden in Ninjago disguised as Museum Curator Dr. Saunders. The Ninja must now battle the Hands of Time and their army of Vermillion, the children of the Great Devourer, as they begin kidnapping Ninjago's best builders and stealing metal all over the city. But as they near closer to uncovering the villains' ultimate goal, the battle becomes personal for Kai and Nya who discover their parents may be involved with the Hands of Time.\n\n===Season 8: Sons of Garmadon (2018)===\nOne year after Wu and the Hands of Time were lost in time aboard the Iron Doom, the Ninja have scattered across Ninjago, tackling missions while searching for their master's whereabouts. In their absence, Ninjago City has been overrun by a cult-like crime syndicate known as the Sons of Garmadon who worship the evil Lord Garmadon. When a mysterious relic known as the Oni Mask of Vengeance is stolen from Borg Industries, The Ninja are summoned by the Royal Family, who ask the heroes to protect the three Oni Masks (The Oni Mask of Deception, the Oni Mask of Vengeance, and the Oni Mask of Hatred), relics from the First Realm which when united would allow the Sons of Garmadon to resurrect a purely evil Garmadon, as well as their adopted daughter, the Jade Princess Harumi. In order to stop the Sons of Garmadon from desecrating his father's sacrifice, Lloyd and the Ninja attempt to find the identity of their leader, the Quiet One, before they can determine the location of the elusive Oni Mask of Hatred, while learning secrets about the origins of Ninjago itself. In the process, Lloyd begins to bond with Harumi who has also lost her parents. But as they grow closer, the Ninja make the startling discovery that Harumi is the Quiet one\n\n===Season 9: Hunted (2018)===\nWith Emperor Garmadon in ruling Ninjago City with an iron fist and the original four Ninja as well as Wu are stranded in Realm of Oni and Dragons after the Colossus destroyed the Destiny's Bounty, any ally of the Ninja and citizen is hunted and imprisoned in Kryptarium Prison. Lloyd, Nya, and the rest of their remaining allies, including a portion of the Elemental Masters, form a resistance to endure and fight back against Harumi, the Sons of Garmadon, and Lord Garmadon himself. Unbeknownst to them, the other Ninja are alive and thanks to Mistak\u00e9's Traveler's Tea, they are in the Realm of the Oni and the Dragon. Here, the barbaric Dragon Hunters, led by the power hungry Iron Baron, capture Dragons and exploit their Elemental Powers to sustain their society. As Dragons are the only beings who can ferry between Realms, the Ninja and a teenage Wu must find the mythical Dragon Armor once worn by the First Spinjitzu Master himself, in order to convince Firstbourne, the mother of all Dragons, to allow them to ride her children out of the Realm so they can rejoin the fight against Lord Garmadon, and save Ninjago.\n\n===Season 10: March of the Oni (2019)===\nShortly after Lord Garmadon's defeat, Ninjago is slowly returning to normal. However, Garmadon calls out to Lloyd to warn him about some dark forces that will soon conquer Ninjago, although Lloyd refuses to listen, believing that his father can't be trusted. Garmadon's warnings soon come true when the Oni invade Ninjago through the Realm Crystal and prove too much for the Ninja to handle. With no other choice, the Ninja form an uneasy alliance with Garmadon to defeat the Oni and save Ninjago from darkness. Will they prevail or will the legacy of Ninjago be lost forever?\n\n===Season 11: Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu (2019-2020)===\n====Part 1: The Fire Chapter====\nSix months after they defeated the Oni, the Ninja have become relaxed, lazy, and out of shape. In order to keep their skills and powers intact, they search for activity or a threat to face. Strangely enough, Ninjago has been in a state of lasting peace. However, Zane begins suffering odd visions of him being killed by Aspheera, Queen of the evil Pyro Vipers, as well as a mysterious castle guarded by the dragon Boreal and home to the Ice Emperor and his Blizzard Samurai. While Zane remains unsure about these frightening visions, the Ninja find their quest when Professor [[Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers|Clutch Powers]] discovers a mysterious Ancient Pyramid which supposedly only a Ninja could survive exploring. Unbeknownst to them, the next threat to Ninjago is right around the corner, as the tomb serves as a prison for Aspheera. After she is unwittingly released by the Ninja, she steals Kai's powers and uses them to revive her army of Pyro Vipers, preparing to conquer Ninjago and exact revenge on somebody who betrayed her thousands of years ago. The Ninja are left trapped in the pyramid, but are eventually rescued by P.I.X.A.L., and attempt to stop Aspheera's campaign of conquest. The Ninja soon learn about the Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu, which grant the user great powers, but can also corrupt them, as well as that Wu is the one that Aspheera is looking for, as he befriended her back when they were children and taught her Spinjitzu, but she betrayed him and used it for evil, taking over the Serpentine, leading to Wu and Garmadon defeating Aspheera using Forbidden Spinjitzu and imprisoning her inside the pyramid. After Aspheera steals one of the two Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu from the museum, the Ninja go after the other, just as Aspheera and her forces attack the Monastery of Spinjitzu. Using the second scroll, the Ninja defeat Aspheera, but Zane is hit with a spell aimed at Wu and gets transported to the Never-Realm. Wu volunteers to go to the Never-Realm on his own and rescue Zane, but the Ninja overpower him and go there themselves, before Wu could warn them that there is no way of return.\n\n====Part 2: The Ice Chapter====\nThe Ninja arrive in the Never-Realm and are brought to a village where they reveal their agenda and help the locals fend off the Blizzard Samurai, led by the mysterious Ice Emperor and his right-hand man Vex. The Ninja believe that Zane was captured by the Ice Emperor and decide to stay at the village, where Kai unsuccessfully attempts to regain his powers, Cole leaves to find the Traveller's Tree in order to collect some leaves for the Travellers' Tea that would help them get back home, along the way befriending Krag, the last survivor of the Yeti species (as they were all slaughtered by the Blizzard Samurai), and Lloyd leaves to find Zane's mech. Along the way, he befriends a Formling named Akita, who can transform into a wolf and wishes to exact revenge on the Ice Emperor for freezing her people. Meanwhile, the village is attacked by the Ice Emperor's dragon Boreal, forcing the remaining Ninja to flee and continue their journey. Lloyd and Akita are later attacked by Boreal as well, who kidnaps Lloyd and takes him to the Ice Emperor, revealed to be none other than Zane: after being banished to the Never-Realm years ago (as time passes differently here), he lost his memory and was manipulated by Vex, a Formling who wished to exact revenge on his people for mocking him due to not being able to change his form, into believing that he is the Ice Emperor, the rightful ruler of the Never-Realm; the two of them then dethroned the actual Emperor, Grimfax, and Zane used the Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu to corrupt people, turning them into the Blizzard Samurai, later also freezing the Formlings and massacring the Yetis. Lloyd tries to get Zane to remember who he truly was, but fails, as the scroll corrupted him as well, and is locked up, where he meets Akita's brother Kataru. The two soon form and alliance with Grimfax (who became a general within the Blizzard Samurai army after being corrupted, but maintained all of his memories and wishes to reclaim his throne) to dethrone Zane and liberate the Never-Realm. Eventually, Kai recovers his powers, destroying Boreal, and Zane recovers his all of his memories after Vex attempts to kill Lloyd, stopping him, before using his powers to undo the effects of the Forbidden Spinjitzu and restore peace to the Never-Realm. Afterwards, Grimfax becomes Emperor of the Never-Realm once again, Vex is banished for his crimes, and all the Ninja say goodbye to their newfound friends and allies, returning home in Ninjago.\n\n===Season 12: Prime Empire (2020)===\nWhen the old, legendary  video-game \"Prime Empire\u201d resurfaces, players begin to disappear. We all know that Jay love games. He, of course, plays \"Prime Empire\" and he soon enters the game. The other Ninja soon find out that the creator of the \"Prime Empire\" has disappeared too, but nobody has seen him in many years. They discover that the creator's name is Milton Dyer. The Ninja think Dyer is actually Unagami. But is it true? The Ninja enter the game so they can stop the avatar of Milton Dyer, while Zane and P.I.X.A.L. remain outside to find Dyer in the real world. The Ninja, with help of Mr. Borg, are going to stop the game in real world. As Lloyd, Cole, Kai, and Nya enter the game, they soon find Jay, but he takes on the name of \"Superstar Rockin' Jay\u201d. Jay meets a new friend named Scott, who entered the game a long time ago, and Scott remains on his last life based on his healthbar. Will the Ninja stop Unagami and \"Prime Empire\u201d? Will they save the players inside the game?\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Characters by voice actor and season\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Pilots: Masters of Spinjitzu (2011)|Pilot]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 1: Rise of the Snakes (2012)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 2: Legacy of the Green Ninja (2012)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 3: Rebooted (2014)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 4: Tournament of Elements (2015)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 5: Possession (2015)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 6: Skybound (2016)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 7: The Hands of Time (2017)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 8: Sons of Garmadon (2018)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 9: Hunted (2018)|9]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 10: March of the Oni (2019)|10]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 11: Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu (2019)|11]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 12: Prime Empire (2020)|12]]\n|-\n!

The current leader of the Ninja, son of Garmadon and Misako, nephew of Master Wu, and the grandson of the First Spinjitzu Master. He frequently wields either a [[sword]] or [[Dual wield|dual swords]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/ninjago/characters/lloyd-f2117af0c8ba45a297655963d70bee0c|title=Lego Ninjago \u2013 Lloyd|publisher=[[Lego.com]]|accessdate=2018-08-07}}</ref>  Lloyd's powers are vaguely defined, a fact admitted by his friends, but he possesses the ability to manipulate green energy and passively shield his body. Lloyd made his debut in Season 1 as a mischievous child wanting to be an evil warlord just like his father. This resulted in childish schemes that were often foiled by the original four Ninja. Lloyd was eventually captured and reformed by the Ninja and Master Wu, Lloyd's paternal uncle, and eventually discovered his destiny as the Green Ninja. While initially mischievous and naive, Lloyd has been tempered by experience and time into a mature and capable ninja. Though still the youngest, he has emerged as the natural leader of the Ninja, displaying wisdom beyond his years. Lloyd greatly appreciates his friends, saying that it was them who taught him the \"importance of being brave, of being strong, and most importantly, being good\". He believes the team's strength comes from \"no one being more important than the other\". Though he can still be rash in matters of family (especially regarding his father) there are few more dedicated and determined to protecting their friends and Ninjago.\n* '''Kai''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 The Red Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Fire]]. Like Lloyd, he frequently wields either a sword or [[Dual wield|dual swords]]. His elemental power grants him limited [[pyrokinesis]] and fire immunity. Kai is fiercely loyal to his friends and family, often willing to do anything to ensure their safety. He often acts on emotion instead of reason, causing him to be hotheaded, cocky, and rash. He also has a strong sense of responsibility, feeling enormous guilt in situations where his friends suffer, such as when Zane sacrificed himself and when Lloyd was possessed. Kai is the elder brother of Nya and son of Ray and Maya.\n*  '''Jay''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 The Blue Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Lightning]]. He frequently wields [[nunchucks]] and more recently, a [[kusarigama]]. His elemental power grants him limited electricity manipulation. He is also a skilled [[mechanic]] and technologically savvy. Jay is inventive and quick-witted, often using comedy to alleviate stressful situations. He is easily excitable and prone to freaking out when in crises but like the other Ninja is intensely loyal to his friends, especially his girlfriend Nya. He is the son of Cliff Gordon and was adopted and raised by Ed and Edna Walker.\n* '''Zane''' (voiced by [[Brent Miller (actor)|Brent Miller]]) \u2013 The White/Titanium Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Ice]]. He frequently wields three-pointed [[shuriken]] and, more recently, a [[bow and arrows]]. His elemental power grants him limited cryokinesis. Zane is intelligent and calculating, often providing intel to the other ninja as it applies to their situation. Initially, he lacked normal social skills. It was later revealed that this was due to Zane secretly being a nindroid, a fact unknown to both the Ninja and Zane himself. Though he is still logical and matter-of-fact, his brotherhood with the other Ninja have enabled him to pick up more human characteristics such as humor. He is the son/creation of Dr. Julien.\n* '''Cole''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 The grounded and solid Black Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Earth]]. He frequently wields a [[scythe]] and, in recent additions to the series, a [[war hammer]]. His elemental power grants him limited earth manipulation and [[super strength]]. The original leader of the Ninja, he is very loyal to his friends and family and has a special love for food, especially cake. \n* '''Nya''' (voiced by [[Kelly Metzger]]) \u2013 The Silver/Maroon Ninja, Elemental Master of [[Water]], and original Samurai X. She frequently wields a [[sword]] and, more recently, a [[spear]]. Her elemental power grants her hydrokinesis. Originally not a part of the Ninja team, Nya joined when her skills as an elemental master of water were needed to combat the threat of the ghost. Tough and determined, she refuses to let anyone tell her what to do. Though she can sometimes be stubborn, Nya true does care about her friends and family often making the most mature decisions of the group and serving as emotional support. A skilled mechanic, she often constructs vehicles for the other Ninja. Nya is Kai's younger sister, daughter of Ray and Maya, and girlfriend of Jay.\n* '''Pixal''' (voiced by Jennifer Hayward) \u2013 A female Nindroid who was originally an assistant to her creator/father Cyrus Borg. She joined the Ninja's team after being influenced by her fellow robot Zane. She was disassembled in season 4 but then uploaded into Zane's systems as an [[artificial intelligence]] system. In season 7, she secretly rebuilt herself and became the new Samurai X. She often provides technical support to the Ninja while serving as Zane's love interest.\n* '''Wu''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]], Caleb Skeris as a baby, Madyx Whiteway as a child) \u2013 The wise, old master of the Ninja who frequently wields his father's staff. He is Lloyd's uncle, younger son of the First Spinjitzu Master, and brother to Garmadon. Because of his Oni heritage, Wu has lived for over a thousand years and has the power to create and manipulate matter. \n* '''Garmadon''' (voiced by Mark Oliver, Kai Emmett as a child) \u2013 Lloyd's father, Wu's older brother, and elder son of the First Spinjitzu Master. Garmadon was a main antagonist for the first two seasons but was later cleansed of evil and became a Sensei to the Ninja. In season 4 he was sacrificed to the Cursed Realm to stop Master Chen's Anacondrai Army. Garmadon was revived in season 8 by the Sons of Garmadon as a being of pure evil and proceeded to conquer all of Ninjago and proclaimed himself as the Realm's new Emperor. However at the end of season 9, Garmadon's reign of terror was finally brought to an end and he and the Sons of Garmadon were all arrested and locked up in Kryptarium Prison. In season 10, he was released to help the Ninja defeat the Oni, after which he left to an unknown part of Ninjago. Because of his Oni heritage, Garmadon has lived for over a thousand years and possesses the ability to destroy matter.\n\n===Ninja Allies===\n* '''Dareth''' (voiced by [[Alan Marriott (voice actor)|Alan Marriott]]) \u2013 The bumbling self-proclaimed \"Brown Ninja\" and Grand Sensei of Dareth's Mojo Dojo. He is a frequent ally of the Ninja both by choice and coincidence.\n* '''Mistak\u00e9''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]] Seasons 1\u20132, Mark Oliver Season 4, [[Tabitha St. Germain]] Seasons 8\u20139) \u2013 An often grouchy old lady who is old friends with Master Wu. She owns a tea shop that sells rare tea with magical properties. In season 9, she revealed to securely be an Oni in disguise. In the same season, it is implied that she was killed by Garmadon.\n* '''Cyrus Borg''' (voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]) \u2013  A tech genius and head of Borg Industries, he is the creator/father of P.I.X.A.L. who has invented all sorts of cutting edge electronic tools and gadgets. He first sought out the Ninja after the Digital Overlord overtook his systems and has built a variety of tools, security systems, machines, and [[vehicles]] to assist the Ninja.\n* '''Ronin''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 A mercenary motivated by self-interest who will assist the Ninja if it suits his needs.\n* '''Police Commissioner''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]) \u2013 The head of Ninjago police, he was originally introduced in season six as an antagonist who pursued the Ninja when they were framed for committing various crimes. Since the Ninja were proved innocent, however, he has assisted them both personally and with the full backing of the police force.\n* '''Krag''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) - The last surviving yeti in the Never-Realm whom Cole befriends.\n\n===Family Members===\n* '''First Spinjitzu Master''' (voiced by Jim Conrad) - The Inventor of Spinjitzu, father of Wu and Garmadon, and grandfather of Lloyd. Originally from the Realm of Oni and Dragon, he created the realm of Ninjago and fought the Overlord to a standstill. He died long before the start of the series.\n* '''Misako''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 Garmadon's wife and Lloyd's mother. Misako is an [[archaeologist]] and frequent ally of the Ninja.\n* '''Dr. Julien''' (voiced by Mark Oliver) \u2013 An inventor and the creator/father of Zane. He died sometime between seasons 2 and 3.\n* '''Ed Walker''' (voiced by Colin Murdock) \u2013 The adoptive father of Jay and the husband of Edna Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Edna Walker''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 The adoptive mother of Jay and the wife of Ed Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Lou''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 Cole's father and notable member of the Royal Blacksmiths, a famous song and [[dance troupe]].\n* '''Ray''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 Kai and Nya's Father, and former Elemental Master of Fire. He previously fought alongside his wife under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War. He is a skilled [[blacksmith]].\n* '''Maya''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 Kai and Nya's mother and former Elemental Master of Water. She previously fought alongside her husband under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War.\n\n===Skulkin===\nThe Skulkin are a breed of living skeletons who were once ruled by Samukai. After becoming their leader, Garmadon sent the Skulkin to Ninjago to find the Four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu, to which they do so. The Skulkin are defeated by the Ninja, though Samukai tries to use the Weapons himself. The power of the weapons destroys him, allowing Garmadon to escape his imprisonment and leaving the Skulkin leaderless. However, Garmadon rebands the Skulkin and leads them to rescue the Ninja and help them steal the Fang Blades from the Serpentine, as part of the temporary alliance Garmadon made with the Ninja to stop the Serpentine's leader Pythor from unleashing the Great Devourer, the very same giant snake who turned Garmadon evil. The Skulkin are willing to help along with this because, as Kruncha comments \"Everybody hates snakes.\"\n \n* '''Samukai''' (voiced by [[Michael Kopsa]]) \u2013 The four-armed Skulkin Ruler of the Underworld until Lord Garmadon defeated him in single combat and took over. He led the attacks on Ninjago, sent by Garmadon to retrieve the four Golden Weapons. He attempted to betray Garmadon by keeping the weapons for himself but, unable to control the power of the four golden weapons at once, was instead overloaded with power and killed. His body created a portal to another realm with Garmadon traveled though to amass more power. He temporarily returned on the Day of the Departed seeking revenge on Jay.\n* '''Kruncha''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A brutish Skulkin General who served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Nuckal.\n* '''Nuckal''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A crazy Skulkin General. He served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Kruncha.\n* '''Wyplash''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 A paranoid Skulkin General. Unlike Samukai, Kruncha, and Nuckal, he was not part of the Golden Weapon raids. After the Skulkin were defeated, he attempted to ambush Nya but was soundly beaten by the lone warrior.\n\n===Serpentine===\nThe Serpentine are a warrior race of humanoid serpents. Originally a race created by the First Spinjitzu Master, they held a prophecy that foretold the coming of the Golden Master. Their attempts to warn the humans resulted in a war that culminated with them being driven underground, partly because both sides were manipulated by Master Chen. Released by Lloyd Garmadon, the Serpentine attempted to conquer Ninjago several times under the leadership of Pythor, Lord Garmadon, and finally Skales. However, after losing in battle to the Overlord's Stone Army, the Serpentine made a home for themselves underground and later aid the people of New Ninjago City escape the Golden Master's attack and then against Master Chen's army of fake Anacondrai.\n \n* '''The Great Devourer''' \u2013 A giant snake worshipped as a goddess by the Serpentine, known to be very dangerous and deadly with the ability to increase its size by consuming anything in its path, including its own kind. The Great Devourer is the main cause of the events in the series as it was responsible for turning Garmadon evil through its venom, and it was the Anacondrai General Pythor intended to release to exact revenge on the people of Ninjago. But the Great Devourer proved to be beyond anyone's control, swallowing Pythor and Sensei Wu alive, the former suffering side effects from exposure to the serpent's stomach acid, and running rampant on Ninjago with the Ninja unable to subdue it. However, in the end, the Ninja manages to lure the Devourer into a trap during its siege of Ninjago City, allowing Lord Garmadon to destroy the Great Devourer with the power of the Golden Weapons in revenge for the grief and madness it caused to him. Despite its death, the monster's venom still seeps into Ninjago City's sewage system, eventually reawakening the Stone Army. However, the Stone Army was eventually destroyed, and upon the Overlord Dragon's defeat Garmadon was cleansed of the Devourer's venom and its effects. It is proven to be female in season 7.\n* Anacondrai \u2013 An honor-bound anaconda-type Serpentine tribe that is the most feared of the Serpentine, able to turn themselves invisible. They are known for their purple coloration, and unlike other Serpentine tribes they all-not just their generals-have snake tails in place of legs. While their leading members were exiled to the Cursed Realm, the rest of the Anacondrai were trapped underground and apparently resorted to cannibalism until only Pythor remained. However, Master Chen and his group of cultists sought to bring them back, using dark magic to become Anacondrai themselves.\n** '''Pythor P. Chumsworth''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The General and last remaining member of the Anacondrai Tribe and former Snake King of the Serpentine, unique among his kind due to his elongated neck and habit of swallowing people larger than himself. Unlike his kind, Pythor is cowardly and dishonest yet has an arrogant sense of pride. While his tribe were sealed away, the Anacondrai Tribe had no food source and ultimately fell to starvation with Pythor becoming the sole survivor. Upon being released, Pythor pretended to be Lloyd's ally to steal the map to the Serpentine tombs to release the Constrictai and the Venomari Tribes. Soon after finding the lost city of Ouroborus, through deceit and an alliance with Skales, Pythor becomes the first Snake King of all Serpentine. It becomes clear soon that Pythor had been driven insane by his imprisonment and his hatred of the surface dwellers, using the allegiance of the tribes to unleash the Great Devourer to exact revenge on people of Ninjago for locking up the Serpentine underground. As the series progressed, Pythor finally managed to collect all four Silver Fang Blades, despite the oppression from the Ninja, Lord Garmadon, and the Skulkin, realizing too late that the Great Devourer would consume everything in its path, including himself alongside Sensei Wu. In season 3, Pythor is revealed to have survived his ordeal within the Great Devourer's stomach with his scales bleached white as he went into hiding. Still bent on revenge against the humans, Pythor aids the Overlord by converting Sensei Wu into Tech Wu and then tricking the ninja into giving him a beacon leading him to Lloyd. This season also revealed a fascination with a breed of electric eel/water snake known as electrocobrai, which he used as a power source for the Overlord and his creations. He swallows the shrinking pill that was meant for the Overlord in \"The Titanium Ninja\" and is chased by the Falcon. In season four he is among the many inmates of Kryptarium Prison-living in a dollhouse inside of a cell-and reveals to the ninja that the Anacondrai were tricked into attacking the humans during the war. He is captured by Chen and his sweat is used to make the Fake Anacondrai permanent, but he manages to discover a means of defeating them by releasing the spirits of the Anacondrai Generals. In gratitude for finally making them proud, Arcturus restores Pythor to his original size, though not his former coloration. He appears to be fond of the name \"Rodrigo\", as he applied this name to a toy basketball he owned while in prison and a rat that he tamed and rode into the final battle with the Anacondrai Cult.\n** '''General Arcturus''' (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) \u2013 General and leader of the Anacondrai Tribe and Supreme Leader of the Serpentine during the First Serpentine War. He and the other Anacondrai generals were banished to the Cursed Realm after being defeated by the Elemental Alliance. The ghosts of the Anacondrai generals were later freed in order to defeat Chen's Anacondrai Cultist Army.\n* Hypnobrai \u2013 A [[cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe that specializes in mind-control. They were locked in a frozen tomb in a tundra. All of them have red eyes they use to hypnotize victims (which explains that their name is a pun on \"Hypnotize\"). The symbol of the staff and the Hypnobrai has a hypnotizing shape like a swirl. Their color is blue.\n** '''Skales''' (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) - Leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe and current Snake King of Serpentine following the perceived death of Pythor. Originally ranked a warrior, Skales became general after challenging and defeating then general Slithraa. After being defeated time and time again by the Ninja he and the rest of the Serpentine found themselves trapped underground by the Stone Army. The Serpentine then reformed, took an oath of [[pacifism]], and began to live peacefully alongside the other inhabitants of Ninjago. Skales settled down, started a family, and has assisted the Ninja in matters relating to snakes. Like all Hypnobrai, Skales can [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] his foes if they stare into his eyes. He is also a master of the ancient art of Fang-kwon-do.\n** '''Slithraa''' (voiced by [[John Novak]]) \u2013 The former leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe. After accidentally hypnotizing himself, he became a servant to Lloyd Garmadon and led his tribe in accomplishing the childish schemes of the young boy. Frustrated by being ordered around by a boy, Skales saw an opportunity to rise in power. After another failed scheme, Slithraa was challenged by Skales to a match in the Slither Pit for the right to lead the Hypnobrai. Slithraa was subsequently defeated by Skales and demoted to warrior.\n* Fangpyre \u2013 A [[pit viper]]-type Serpentine tribe who specializes in venomous bites that transform the victim into a Serpentine (depending on their element) with snake-like traits. Strangely if a Fangpyre bites a vehicle, it transforms instantly. But if they bite a person, it takes a long time for them to transform (probably because the person's immune system fights the transformation). Their anti-venom, as with the other Serpentine Tribes, is located inside the staff of their tribe. If a Fangpyre bites another Fangpyre, the Fangpyre grows another head, resulting in the slightly comedic quirk that each head speaks halves or thirds of a sentence if it is long enough. The sign of the staff and the Fangpyre are fangs with a snake tongue sticking out.\n** '''Fangtom''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]]) \u2013 The two-headed leader and General of the Fangpyre Tribe. He is old friends with Skales and, like all Fangpyre, has the ability to turn anyone or anything into a snake by bitting and injecting them with his poisonous [[venom]].\n* Constrictai \u2013 A [[boa constrictor]]-type Serpentine tribe who specializes in constricting anyone and burrowing underground at a fast speed. They're also the shortest and the dumbest of all Serpentine tribes, but they are second strongest after the Anacondrai. The sign of the staff and the Constrictai is orange and has three rings connecting to each other representing constricting. The anti-venom in the staff awakens those knocked out when being choked. They were sealed within the Mountain of a Million Steps until released by Pythor.\n** '''Skalidor''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The powerful leader and general of the Constrictai Tribe. Like all Constrictai, Skalidor has the ability to burrow underground and possesses abundant strength.\n* Venomari \u2013 A [[spitting cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe with odd tusks and multiple eyes who specializes in spitting a hallucination-inducing venom. They were sealed in a tomb within the Poisonous Bogs until Pythor released them. The symbol of the staff and the Venomari is green with drops of venom coming out of the symbol.\n** '''Acidicus''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]) \u2013 The intelligent leader and general of the Venomari Tribe. Like all Venomari, Acidicus has the ability to spit venom at his foes which causes fear inducing [[hallucinations]].\n* Vermillion \u2013 The Vermillion are masses of snakes that can assume human form and are the pure first-generation progeny and children of the Great Devourer.\n** '''Machia''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 The Supreme Commander of the Vermillion Tribe with [[Gorgon]]-like hair.\n** '''Raggmunk''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 General of the Vermillion Tribe.\n** '''Blunck''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 General of the Vermillion Tribe.\n* Pyro Vipers - A new, original tribe of Serpentine named by Gayle Gossip. They are the reanimated, zombified corpses of the original Serpentine race during the days of the First Spinjitzu Master, who may have evolved into the tribes known during the wars. Joined by the Elemental Cobras and Fire Fang, they're led by Queen Aspheera to wreak havoc on Ninjago, acquire the Forbidden Scroll and banish Master Wu to the Never-Realm. Their fate after attacking the Spinjago Monastery is unknown, but it's possible they were imprisoned in Kryptarium.\n** '''Aspheera''' (voiced by [[Pauline Newstone]]) - A young sorceress of the ancient Serpentine who desired to learn Spinjitzu. In exchange for learning combat, she released Garmadon and Wu from the dungeons after they trespassed on the valley against their father's law. Based on Aspheera's development, she and Wu became friends for the next few months/years, and Wu has her master Spinjitzu. However, she betrays her promise to Wu, to never use Spinjitzu for evil, and overthrows King Mambo with the intention to conquer Ninjago for herself. Garmadon and Wu arm themselves with the Forbidden Scrolls on staffs and defeat Aspheera in the throne room. She blames Wu for not teaching her Forbidden Spinjitzu and turning on her, believing that her actions of mutiny were acceptable. When she's sentenced to magical entombment, she swears vengeance on Wu. Around a thousand years later, Jay and Nya accidentally set her free when the Ninja are exploring the pyramid in the Desert of Doom. It was a vision predicted by Zane since the season's beginning. Aspheera steals Kai's fire powers and revives the mummified Serpentines. She destroys the pyramid, summons an army of cobras and her Fire Fang serpent. She comes to conflict with the Ninja multiple times upon seizing the Forbidden Scroll. She corners Wu, Kai, Jay, and Cole in the Monastery's cave, and fights P.I.X.A.L.'s Titan Mech. The fight is joined by Lloyd, Nya, and Zane, who have found the second Forbidden Scroll. Aspheera is defeated by Zane and locked in Kryptarium Prison in Garmadon's cell, but not before banishing Zane to the forsaken Never-Realm.\n** '''Char''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) - Aspheera's second in command, who displays attraction to his mistress and immense loyalty. He behaves like an immature child, which gets on Aspheera's nerves, but serves fiercely to the end.\n** '''King Mambo The Fifth''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) - The original king of the Serpentine during the days of the First Spinjitzu Master, who has Garmadon and Wu imprisoned after breaking their truce. He was overthrown by Aspheera but restored to his rightful place on the throne when Wu defeats Aspheera. He then sentences Aspheera to magical entombment as punishment.\n\n===Overlord's Forces===\n* '''The Overlord''' (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) \u2013 The Ultimate Evil who fought the First Spinjitzu Master to a draw.

Despite his size, he is actually a capable and observant fighter.\n\n===Anacondrai Cultists===\n* '''Master Chen''' (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) \u2013 Skylor's father and leader of the Anacondrai Cultists.

They have the ability to turn other living things into ghosts, and some of them can infuse their ghostly energy into vehicles and objects. As ghosts they are immune to most forms of physical attack, but are vulnerable to water as it is ever changing, which can cause them to dissolve into ectoplasm. Their only other vulnerability is to Deepstone, a substance mined from beneath the ocean floor, which can either contain them or be forged into weapons for use against them, such as the Aeroblades the ninja obtain from Ronin. While Morro leads the group in the field, their true master is the Preeminent, Queen and embodiment of the Cursed Realm.\n \n* '''The Preeminent''' \u2013 The embodiment of the Cursed Realm and the master of Morro and the Ghost Warriors.

The resurrected villian picks Wu as his target, since they left things unsettled.

She then gained the Ninja's trust by exploiting their sympathy for her adoptive parents' deaths and pretended to be in love with Lloyd, who promised to protect her from the Sons of Garmadon.

Though the Ninja eventually discovered she was the Quiet One, they did not succeed in preventing the resurrection of Lord Garmadon, resulting in the fall of Ninjago.

After Garmadon sacrificed himself and was sent into the Cursed Realm, Lloyd left the team to cope with losing his father. The remaining members meet the new threat Ronin, a mercenary, who partially erases the Ninja's memories. The Ninja travel to the Toxic Bogs, after which they have a vision of weapons that can restore their memories. They collect the weapons and go to see Lloyd, who takes them to see his mother for help. Once they find the Primal Fulcrum, the Ninja free Lloyd's mother from Ronin's control. Ronin freezes them and grabs the remaining elemental forges. He plans to use the Fulcrum to bring back Chen from the Cursed Realm. The Ninja chase Ronin into a portal, where the Ninja have a final battle with Ronin; he escapes and knocks the Ninja's weapons into the abyss. The ending reveals the game was a story told by Kai.

It was created to coincide with the [[Lego Ninjago]] line of construction toys, many of which are based on elements of the series. It centers on the fictional world of Ninjago, telling the story of a group of teenage [[Ninja]] and their battles against the forces of evil. The series was animated in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Wil Film ApS for the first ten seasons, subtitled \"Masters of Spinjitzu\". Animation was relocated to [[WildBrain|WildBrain Studios]] in Canada starting with the eleventh season. The English-language voice cast has been recorded in Canada for its entire run. As of 2020 it is the longest currently running series airing on Cartoon Network. \n\n''Ninjago'' began with two pilot episodes in January 2011, which were followed by two 13-episode seasons that aired from January to November 2012. Both the Lego theme and the series had an intended shelf life of three years, so the second season was originally intended to be the last. However, continued success of the series and its product line led to the show continuing ever since with twelve seasons being produced as of 2020.\n\nThe series was created by Michael Hegner and Tommy Andreasen, two Danish film producers. In Denmark, where the series' original production companies are located, ''Ninjago'' premiered on [[Nickelodeon (Denmark)|Nickelodeon]]. It airs on various Nickelodeon networks internationally and on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States, United Kingdom and Poland. In [[Canada]], the series is broadcast on [[Teletoon]] and [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]].<ref name=teletoon>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2012/08/pr-teletoon-programming-highlights-september-2012/|title=PR: TELETOON Programming Highlights, September 2012|work=toonzone.net}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe show is mainly set in the [[realm]] of Ninjago, a place loosely inspired by [[East Asian culture|East Asian myths and culture]]. While featuring several historically designed buildings and traditional clothing, Ninjago is in a modern setting, incorporating large metropolises with skyscrapers, current-age (and futuristic) vehicles, modern electronics, semi-robotic exo-suits, and other futuristic technology.\n\n==Synopsis==\nLong before the events of the series, the First Spinjitzu Master used the power of the Golden Weapons to create the realm of Ninjago. Trained in the legendary art of Spinjitzu by the wise Master Wu, a group of heroic ninja (Kai, Jay, Cole, and Zane, and eventually Lloyd and Nya) fight to defend their land against the various foes who wish to conquer it.\n\n===Pilot Episodes (2011)===\nLong before time had a name, the First Spinjitzu Master created the [[realm]] of [[Ninjago]] with the four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu: the Scythe of Quakes, the Shurikens of Ice, the Nunchucks of Lightning, and the Sword of Fire. Before he passed, his sons swore to protect the weapons from evil, but the older brother, Garmadon, was taken over by darkness and aimed to wield all four weapons so he could recreate Ninjago in his own image. In the ensuing battle between brothers, the younger brother Wu cast Garmadon down to the Underworld, hiding the weapons across the land and placing a guardian at each hiding spot. In anticipation of Garmadon's return, Wu seeks out four talented young Ninja to learn the ways of the Ninja, master the art of Spinjitzu, and find the Golden Weapons before Garmadon and his minions can claim them for their maniacal machinations.\n\n===Season 1: Rise of the Serpentine (2012)===\nSince Lord Garmadon's disappearance, peace has returned to Ninjago. Rather than prepare for his return, the Ninja have become lazy, playing video games and eating junk food instead of continuing their training. With their guard down, they find themselves thrown back into action when Garmadon's son Lloyd releases the five warring tribes of Serpentine, a race of snake-people who once ruled over Ninjago before being sealed away in underground tombs. Now led by the treacherous Pythor P. Chumsworth, last of the fearsome Anacondrai, the vengeful snakes seek to find the four Silver Fangblades to awaken the Great Devourer, an indestructible giant serpent that grows the more it consumes. It's name is \"The Great Devouer\".  To stop them, the Ninja make new allies as they try to overcome emotional barriers and unlock their True Potential and trying to learn the identity of the legendary Green Ninja spoken of in a prophecy.\n\n===Season 2: The Final Battle (2012) ===\nMore commonly known as \u201cThe Legacy of The Green Ninja\u201d.\nAfter defeating the Great Devourer, Lord Garmadon has escaped with the Golden Weapons and taken command of the Serpentine. At the Golden Peaks, birthplace of the weapons, he forges them into a Mega Weapon. Able to create anything he pleases, Garmadon aims to interrupt Lloyd's training and prevent him from achieving his destiny as the Green Ninja. To ensure Lloyd is ready to face his father, the Ninja combat Garmadon's creations at every turn. But both sides are unaware of an evil dwelling on the fabled Island of Darkness pulling the strings for thousands of years to conquer all. The fate of Ninjago hangs in the balance as the Final Battle between good and evil looms closer.\n\n===Season 3: Rebooted (2014)===\nGood prevailed in the Final Battle with Lloyd as the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master defeating the Overlord and saving both Ninjago and his father. Ninjago City was left in ruin until genius inventor Cyrus Borg led the reconstruction process bringing about New Ninjago City, a hub of futuristic technological advancements. In this hi-tech age of peace, the Ninja have retired to teaching at Wu's Academy. During a field trip to Borg Tower, center of all this innovation, they discover that the Overlord has survived his fight with the Golden Ninja in the form of a virus, infecting Borg's systems. To escape the Digiverse, he plots to steal Lloyd's Golden Power and become a prophesized evil known as the Golden Master. Leaving Lloyd under the protection of a now pacifistic Garmadon, the Ninja must find the hard-drive containing the Digital Overlord and reboot the system with Borg's tech-hacking Techno Blades, to keep their friend safe and put an end to the Overlord's evil once and for all.\n\n===Season 4: The Tournament of Elements (2015)===\nTo defeat the Golden Master, Zane was forced to absorb power from the Golden Armor, sacrificing his life and leaving the Ninja team fractured in the process. But when notorious crime boss and noodle house owner Master Chen invites them to his Tournament of Elements; a competition between other Elemental Masters like them, with the promise of seeing Zane again, the Ninja, accompanied by Garmadon, find themselves traveling to Chen's Island and quickly making enemies. However, when they discover that Chen and his cult of Anacondrai worshippers use the Staff of Elements to strip those who lose of their Elemental Powers for a spell that could restart a war from Ninjago's past, they attempt to form an alliance with the Elemental Masters.\n\n===Season 5: Possession (2015)===\nChen and his Anacondrai Cultists have been banished to the Cursed Realm by General Arcturus and the Anacondrai Generals. But to free the generals, Garmadon had to take their place amongst the cursed. As a distraught Lloyd mourns the loss of his father, he is called to a solo mission where he is possessed by the jealous ghost of Wu's first student Morro, the Master of Wind, who escaped the Cursed Realm when Garmadon opened the portal. Now, the powerless Ninja face their friend as Morro aims to find the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master and use the Realm Crystal, gateway to the Sixteen Realms parallel to Ninjago, to allow his master to curse all that exists. To stop him, the Ninja ally with mercenary and shady businessman Ronin, mastering the lost art of Airjitzu and following three clues to the tomb's location engraved on Wu's staff. But the true key to victory lies with Nya, who learns she is the current Master of Water, which happens to be a ghost's greatest weakness and Nya finds her true potential.\n\n===Season 6: Skybound (2016)===\nTheir victory over the Preeminent has brought the Ninja overwhelming fame. While they struggle to continue to defend Ninjago while warding off obsessed fans, Jay tangles with seeing a future with Nya in the First Spinjitzu Master's Tomb. Things go further downhill for the heroes when the ghost of Chen's right-hand man Clouse (who survived the destruction of the Cursed Realm) releases Nadakhan the Djinn, the captain of the Misfortune's Keep and Sky Pirates. Framing the Ninja and reuniting with his crew, Nadakhan learns that the destruction of the Cursed Realm has caused the collapse of its Sister Realm and his former home and kingdom of Djinjago. With their fans turned against them and their team dwindling in numbers as the Djinn turns their wishes against them to trap them in his Sword of Souls, the Ninja find themselves in a battle across Ninjago to stop a vengeful Nadakhan from rebuilding his Realm with chunks of theirs. But when he sets his eyes on marrying Nya, a love-struck Jay must find the right wish to save his love, home, and friends.\n\n===Day of the Departed (2016)===\nOn the Day of the Departed, the people of Ninjago light lanterns to remember those they've lost. While his friends celebrate, Cole, whose ghostly state has deteriorated to the point of him randomly fading in and out of existence, intends to exact revenge on Master Yang for turning him into a ghost during the Ninja's attempt to learn Airjitzu. Commandeering the Yin Blade, a dark magic weapon Yang once used in an attempt to gain immortality, Cole enters the Temple of Airjitzu and prepares to \"close the circle\" by defeating the Airjitzu Master. But when his gambit for revenge leads to the accidental revival of some of the Ninja's greatest enemies, the heroes find themselves facing their vengeful foes once again as they attempt to take the Ninja's place amongst the living using magic Departed Blades. Meanwhile, Cole faces Yang and his students alone as, thanks to his actions, the Airjitzu Master has reclaimed the Yin Blade and plots to take advantage of a special Yin Yang Eclipse to cut the Rift of Return which will allow him to return to the living world.\n\n===Season 7: The Hands of Time (2017)===\nFollowing the events on the Day of the Departed, both Cole and the Temple of Airjitzu have been restored. As the Ninja setup base in the temple, they find themselves stuck cleaning up the damage at the Ninjago Museum of History. Here, they learn of the Hands of Time, twin Elemental Masters of Time itself who betrayed the Elemental Masters after the Serpentine Wars in belief their Element was the strongest. Meanwhile, at the ruins of the Monastery of Spinjitzu, Wu awaits the return of Acronix, the younger of the \"Time Twins\", to finish the battle they started 40 years ago. But without the rest of the team by his side, Wu is overwhelmed by Acronix who uses a move known as the \"Time Punch\" to accelerate Wu's aging one day per hour. Now Acronix has reunited with Krux, the older twin, who has remained hidden in Ninjago disguised as Museum Curator Dr. Saunders. The Ninja must now battle the Hands of Time and their army of Vermillion, the children of the Great Devourer, as they begin kidnapping Ninjago's best builders and stealing metal all over the city. But as they near closer to uncovering the villains' ultimate goal, the battle becomes personal for Kai and Nya who discover their parents may be involved with the Hands of Time.\n\n===Season 8: Sons of Garmadon (2018)===\nOne year after Wu and the Hands of Time were lost in time aboard the Iron Doom, the Ninja have scattered across Ninjago, tackling missions while searching for their master's whereabouts. In their absence, Ninjago City has been overrun by a cult-like crime syndicate known as the Sons of Garmadon who worship the evil Lord Garmadon. When a mysterious relic known as the Oni Mask of Vengeance is stolen from Borg Industries, The Ninja are summoned by the Royal Family, who ask the heroes to protect the three Oni Masks (The Oni Mask of Deception, the Oni Mask of Vengeance, and the Oni Mask of Hatred), relics from the First Realm which when united would allow the Sons of Garmadon to resurrect a purely evil Garmadon, as well as their adopted daughter, the Jade Princess Harumi. In order to stop the Sons of Garmadon from desecrating his father's sacrifice, Lloyd and the Ninja attempt to find the identity of their leader, the Quiet One, before they can determine the location of the elusive Oni Mask of Hatred, while learning secrets about the origins of Ninjago itself. In the process, Lloyd begins to bond with Harumi who has also lost her parents. But as they grow closer, the Ninja make the startling discovery that Harumi is the Quiet one\n\n===Season 9: Hunted (2018)===\nWith Emperor Garmadon in ruling Ninjago City with an iron fist and the original four Ninja as well as Wu are stranded in Realm of Oni and Dragons after the Colossus destroyed the Destiny's Bounty, any ally of the Ninja and citizen is hunted and imprisoned in Kryptarium Prison. Lloyd, Nya, and the rest of their remaining allies, including a portion of the Elemental Masters, form a resistance to endure and fight back against Harumi, the Sons of Garmadon, and Lord Garmadon himself. Unbeknownst to them, the other Ninja are alive and thanks to Mistak\u00e9's Traveler's Tea, they are in the Realm of the Oni and the Dragon. Here, the barbaric Dragon Hunters, led by the power hungry Iron Baron, capture Dragons and exploit their Elemental Powers to sustain their society. As Dragons are the only beings who can ferry between Realms, the Ninja and a teenage Wu must find the mythical Dragon Armor once worn by the First Spinjitzu Master himself, in order to convince Firstbourne, the mother of all Dragons, to allow them to ride her children out of the Realm so they can rejoin the fight against Lord Garmadon, and save Ninjago.\n\n===Season 10: March of the Oni (2019)===\nShortly after Lord Garmadon's defeat, Ninjago is slowly returning to normal. However, Garmadon calls out to Lloyd to warn him about some dark forces that will soon conquer Ninjago, although Lloyd refuses to listen, believing that his father can't be trusted. Garmadon's warnings soon come true when the Oni invade Ninjago through the Realm Crystal and prove too much for the Ninja to handle. With no other choice, the Ninja form an uneasy alliance with Garmadon to defeat the Oni and save Ninjago from darkness. Will they prevail or will the legacy of Ninjago be lost forever?\n\n===Season 11: Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu (2019-2020)===\n====Part 1: The Fire Chapter====\nSix months after they defeated the Oni, the Ninja have become relaxed, lazy, and out of shape. In order to keep their skills and powers intact, they search for activity or a threat to face. Strangely enough, Ninjago has been in a state of lasting peace. However, Zane begins suffering odd visions of him being killed by Aspheera, Queen of the evil Pyro Vipers, as well as a mysterious castle guarded by the dragon Boreal and home to the Ice Emperor and his Blizzard Samurai. While Zane remains unsure about these frightening visions, the Ninja find their quest when Professor [[Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers|Clutch Powers]] discovers a mysterious Ancient Pyramid which supposedly only a Ninja could survive exploring. Unbeknownst to them, the next threat to Ninjago is right around the corner, as the tomb serves as a prison for Aspheera. After she is unwittingly released by the Ninja, she steals Kai's powers and uses them to revive her army of Pyro Vipers, preparing to conquer Ninjago and exact revenge on somebody who betrayed her thousands of years ago. The Ninja are left trapped in the pyramid, but are eventually rescued by P.I.X.A.L., and attempt to stop Aspheera's campaign of conquest. The Ninja soon learn about the Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu, which grant the user great powers, but can also corrupt them, as well as that Wu is the one that Aspheera is looking for, as he befriended her back when they were children and taught her Spinjitzu, but she betrayed him and used it for evil, taking over the Serpentine, leading to Wu and Garmadon defeating Aspheera using Forbidden Spinjitzu and imprisoning her inside the pyramid. After Aspheera steals one of the two Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu from the museum, the Ninja go after the other, just as Aspheera and her forces attack the Monastery of Spinjitzu. Using the second scroll, the Ninja defeat Aspheera, but Zane is hit with a spell aimed at Wu and gets transported to the Never-Realm. Wu volunteers to go to the Never-Realm on his own and rescue Zane, but the Ninja overpower him and go there themselves, before Wu could warn them that there is no way of return.\n\n====Part 2: The Ice Chapter====\nThe Ninja arrive in the Never-Realm and are brought to a village where they reveal their agenda and help the locals fend off the Blizzard Samurai, led by the mysterious Ice Emperor and his right-hand man Vex. The Ninja believe that Zane was captured by the Ice Emperor and decide to stay at the village, where Kai unsuccessfully attempts to regain his powers, Cole leaves to find the Traveller's Tree in order to collect some leaves for the Travellers' Tea that would help them get back home, along the way befriending Krag, the last survivor of the Yeti species (as they were all slaughtered by the Blizzard Samurai), and Lloyd leaves to find Zane's mech. Along the way, he befriends a Formling named Akita, who can transform into a wolf and wishes to exact revenge on the Ice Emperor for freezing her people. Meanwhile, the village is attacked by the Ice Emperor's dragon Boreal, forcing the remaining Ninja to flee and continue their journey. Lloyd and Akita are later attacked by Boreal as well, who kidnaps Lloyd and takes him to the Ice Emperor, revealed to be none other than Zane: after being banished to the Never-Realm years ago (as time passes differently here), he lost his memory and was manipulated by Vex, a Formling who wished to exact revenge on his people for mocking him due to not being able to change his form, into believing that he is the Ice Emperor, the rightful ruler of the Never-Realm; the two of them then dethroned the actual Emperor, Grimfax, and Zane used the Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu to corrupt people, turning them into the Blizzard Samurai, later also freezing the Formlings and massacring the Yetis. Lloyd tries to get Zane to remember who he truly was, but fails, as the scroll corrupted him as well, and is locked up, where he meets Akita's brother Kataru. The two soon form and alliance with Grimfax (who became a general within the Blizzard Samurai army after being corrupted, but maintained all of his memories and wishes to reclaim his throne) to dethrone Zane and liberate the Never-Realm. Eventually, Kai recovers his powers, destroying Boreal, and Zane recovers his all of his memories after Vex attempts to kill Lloyd, stopping him, before using his powers to undo the effects of the Forbidden Spinjitzu and restore peace to the Never-Realm. Afterwards, Grimfax becomes Emperor of the Never-Realm once again, Vex is banished for his crimes, and all the Ninja say goodbye to their newfound friends and allies, returning home in Ninjago.\n\n===Season 12: Prime Empire (2020)===\nWhen the old, legendary  video-game \"Prime Empire\u201d resurfaces, players begin to disappear. We all know that Jay love games. He, of course, plays \"Prime Empire\" and he soon enters the game. The other Ninja soon find out that the creator of the \"Prime Empire\" has disappeared too, but nobody has seen him in many years. They discover that the creator's name is Milton Dyer. The Ninja think Dyer is actually Unagami. But is it true? The Ninja enter the game so they can stop the avatar of Milton Dyer, while Zane and P.I.X.A.L. remain outside to find Dyer in the real world. The Ninja, with help of Mr. Borg, are going to stop the game in real world. As Lloyd, Cole, Kai, and Nya enter the game, they soon find Jay, but he takes on the name of \"Superstar Rockin' Jay\u201d. Jay meets a new friend named Scott, who entered the game a long time ago, and Scott remains on his last life based on his healthbar. Will the Ninja stop Unagami and \"Prime Empire\u201d? Will they save the players inside the game?\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Characters by voice actor and season\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Pilots: Masters of Spinjitzu (2011)|Pilot]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 1: Rise of the Snakes (2012)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 2: Legacy of the Green Ninja (2012)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 3: Rebooted (2014)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 4: Tournament of Elements (2015)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 5: Possession (2015)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 6: Skybound (2016)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 7: The Hands of Time (2017)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 8: Sons of Garmadon (2018)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 9: Hunted (2018)|9]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 10: March of the Oni (2019)|10]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 11: Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu (2019)|11]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 12: Prime Empire (2020)|12]]\n|-\n!

The current leader of the Ninja, son of Garmadon and Misako, nephew of Master Wu, and the grandson of the First Spinjitzu Master. He frequently wields either a [[sword]] or [[Dual wield|dual swords]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/ninjago/characters/lloyd-f2117af0c8ba45a297655963d70bee0c|title=Lego Ninjago \u2013 Lloyd|publisher=[[Lego.com]]|accessdate=2018-08-07}}</ref>  Lloyd's powers are vaguely defined, a fact admitted by his friends, but he possesses the ability to manipulate green energy and passively shield his body. Lloyd made his debut in Season 1 as a mischievous child wanting to be an evil warlord just like his father. This resulted in childish schemes that were often foiled by the original four Ninja. Lloyd was eventually captured and reformed by the Ninja and Master Wu, Lloyd's paternal uncle, and eventually discovered his destiny as the Green Ninja. While initially mischievous and naive, Lloyd has been tempered by experience and time into a mature and capable ninja. Though still the youngest, he has emerged as the natural leader of the Ninja, displaying wisdom beyond his years. Lloyd greatly appreciates his friends, saying that it was them who taught him the \"importance of being brave, of being strong, and most importantly, being good\". He believes the team's strength comes from \"no one being more important than the other\". Though he can still be rash in matters of family (especially regarding his father) there are few more dedicated and determined to protecting their friends and Ninjago.\n* '''Kai''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 The Red Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Fire]]. Like Lloyd, he frequently wields either a sword or [[Dual wield|dual swords]]. His elemental power grants him limited [[pyrokinesis]] and fire immunity. Kai is fiercely loyal to his friends and family, often willing to do anything to ensure their safety. He often acts on emotion instead of reason, causing him to be hotheaded, cocky, and rash. He also has a strong sense of responsibility, feeling enormous guilt in situations where his friends suffer, such as when Zane sacrificed himself and when Lloyd was possessed. Kai is the elder brother of Nya and son of Ray and Maya.\n*  '''Jay''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 The Blue Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Lightning]]. He frequently wields [[nunchucks]] and more recently, a [[kusarigama]]. His elemental power grants him limited electricity manipulation. He is also a skilled [[mechanic]] and technologically savvy. Jay is inventive and quick-witted, often using comedy to alleviate stressful situations. He is easily excitable and prone to freaking out when in crises but like the other Ninja is intensely loyal to his friends, especially his girlfriend Nya. He is the son of Cliff Gordon and was adopted and raised by Ed and Edna Walker.\n* '''Zane''' (voiced by [[Brent Miller (actor)|Brent Miller]]) \u2013 The White/Titanium Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Ice]]. He frequently wields three pointed [[shuriken]] and, more recently, a [[bow and arrows]]. His elemental power grants him limited cryokinesis. Zane is intelligent and calculating, often providing intel to the other ninja as it applies to their situation. Initially, he lacked normal social skills. It was later revealed that this was due to Zane secretly being a nindroid, a fact unknown to both the Ninja and Zane himself. Though he is still logical and matter-of-fact, his brotherhood with the other Ninja have enabled him to pick up more human characteristics such as humor. He is the son/creation of Dr. Julien.\n* '''Cole''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 The grounded and solid Black Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Earth]]. He frequently wields a [[scythe]] and, in recent additions to the series, a [[war hammer]]. His elemental power grants him limited earth manipulation and [[super strength]]. The original leader of the Ninja, he is very loyal to his friends and family and has a special love for food, especially cake. \n* '''Nya''' (voiced by [[Kelly Metzger]]) \u2013 The Silver/Maroon Ninja, Elemental Master of [[Water]], and original Samurai X. She frequently wields a [[sword]] and, more recently, a [[spear]]. Her elemental power grants her hydrokinesis. Originally not a part of the Ninja team, Nya joined when her skills as an elemental master of water were needed to combat the threat of the ghost. Tough and determined, she refuses to let anyone tell her what to do. Though she can sometimes be stubborn, Nya true does care about her friends and family often making the most mature decisions of the group and serving as emotional support. A skilled mechanic, she often constructs vehicles for the other Ninja. Nya is Kai's younger sister, daughter of Ray and Maya, and girlfriend of Jay.\n* '''Pixal''' (voiced by Jennifer Hayward) \u2013 A female Nindroid who was originally an assistant to her creator/father Cyrus Borg. She joined the Ninja's team after being influenced by her fellow robot Zane. She was disassembled in season 4 but then uploaded into Zane's systems as an [[artificial intelligence]] system. In season 7, she secretly rebuilt herself and became the new Samurai X. She often provides technical support to the Ninja while serving as Zane's love interest.\n* '''Wu''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]], Caleb Skeris as a baby, Madyx Whiteway as a child) \u2013 The wise, old master of the Ninja who frequently wields his father's staff. He is Lloyd's uncle, younger son of the First Spinjitzu Master, and brother to Garmadon. Because of his Oni heritage, Wu has lived for over a thousand years and has the power to create and manipulate matter. \n* '''Garmadon''' (voiced by Mark Oliver, Kai Emmett as a child) \u2013 Lloyd's father, Wu's older brother, and elder son of the First Spinjitzu Master. Garmadon was a main antagonist for the first two seasons but was later cleansed of evil and became a Sensei to the Ninja. In season 4 he was sacrificed to the Cursed Realm to stop Master Chen's Anacondrai Army. Garmadon was revived in season 8 by the Sons of Garmadon as a being of pure evil and proceeded to conquer all of Ninjago and proclaimed himself as the Realm's new Emperor. However at the end of season 9, Garmadon's reign of terror was finally brought to an end and he and the Sons of Garmadon were all arrested and locked up in Kryptarium Prison. In season 10, he was released to help the Ninja defeat the Oni, after which he left to an unknown part of Ninjago. Because of his Oni heritage, Garmadon has lived for over a thousand years and possesses the ability to destroy matter.\n\n===Ninja Allies===\n* '''Dareth''' (voiced by [[Alan Marriott (voice actor)|Alan Marriott]]) \u2013 The bumbling self-proclaimed \"Brown Ninja\" and Grand Sensei of Dareth's Mojo Dojo. He is a frequent ally of the Ninja both by choice and coincidence.\n* '''Mistak\u00e9''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]] Seasons 1\u20132, Mark Oliver Season 4, [[Tabitha St. Germain]] Seasons 8\u20139) \u2013 An often grouchy old lady who is old friends with Master Wu. She owns a tea shop that sells rare tea with magical properties. In season 9, she revealed to securely be an Oni in disguise. In the same season, it is implied that she was killed by Garmadon.\n* '''Cyrus Borg''' (voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]) \u2013  A tech genius and head of Borg Industries, he is the creator/father of P.I.X.A.L. who has invented all sorts of cutting edge electronic tools and gadgets. He first sought out the Ninja after the Digital Overlord overtook his systems and has built a variety of tools, security systems, machines, and [[vehicles]] to assist the Ninja.\n* '''Ronin''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 A mercenary motivated by self-interest who will assist the Ninja if it suits his needs.\n* '''Police Commissioner''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]) \u2013 The head of Ninjago police, he was originally introduced in season six as an antagonist who pursued the Ninja when they were framed for committing various crimes. Since the Ninja were proved innocent, however, he has assisted them both personally and with the full backing of the police force.\n* '''Krag''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) - The last surviving yeti in the Never-Realm whom Cole befriends.\n\n===Family Members===\n* '''First Spinjitzu Master''' (voiced by Jim Conrad) - The Inventor of Spinjitzu, father of Wu and Garmadon, and grandfather of Lloyd. Originally from the Realm of Oni and Dragon, he created the realm of Ninjago and fought the Overlord to a standstill. He died long before the start of the series.\n* '''Misako''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 Garmadon's wife and Lloyd's mother. Misako is an [[archaeologist]] and frequent ally of the Ninja.\n* '''Dr. Julien''' (voiced by Mark Oliver) \u2013 An inventor and the creator/father of Zane. He died sometime between seasons 2 and 3.\n* '''Ed Walker''' (voiced by Colin Murdock) \u2013 The adoptive father of Jay and the husband of Edna Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Edna Walker''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 The adoptive mother of Jay and the wife of Ed Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Lou''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 Cole's father and notable member of the Royal Blacksmiths, a famous song and [[dance troupe]].\n* '''Ray''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 Kai and Nya's Father, and former Elemental Master of Fire. He previously fought alongside his wife under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War. He is a skilled [[blacksmith]].\n* '''Maya''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 Kai and Nya's mother and former Elemental Master of Water. She previously fought alongside her husband under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War.\n\n===Skulkin===\nThe Skulkin are a breed of living skeletons who were once ruled by Samukai. After becoming their leader, Garmadon sent the Skulkin to Ninjago to find the Four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu, to which they do so. The Skulkin are defeated by the Ninja, though Samukai tries to use the Weapons himself. The power of the weapons destroys him, allowing Garmadon to escape his imprisonment and leaving the Skulkin leaderless. However, Garmadon rebands the Skulkin and leads them to rescue the Ninja and help them steal the Fang Blades from the Serpentine, as part of the temporary alliance Garmadon made with the Ninja to stop the Serpentine's leader Pythor from unleashing the Great Devourer, the very same giant snake who turned Garmadon evil. The Skulkin are willing to help along with this because, as Kruncha comments \"Everybody hates snakes.\"\n \n* '''Samukai''' (voiced by [[Michael Kopsa]]) \u2013 The four-armed Skulkin Ruler of the Underworld until Lord Garmadon defeated him in single combat and took over. He led the attacks on Ninjago, sent by Garmadon to retrieve the four Golden Weapons. He attempted to betray Garmadon by keeping the weapons for himself but, unable to control the power of the four golden weapons at once, was instead overloaded with power and killed. His body created a portal to another realm with Garmadon traveled though to amass more power. He temporarily returned on the Day of the Departed seeking revenge on Jay.\n* '''Kruncha''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A brutish Skulkin General who served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Nuckal.\n* '''Nuckal''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A crazy Skulkin General. He served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Kruncha.\n* '''Wyplash''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 A paranoid Skulkin General. Unlike Samukai, Kruncha, and Nuckal, he was not part of the Golden Weapon raids. After the Skulkin were defeated, he attempted to ambush Nya but was soundly beaten by the lone warrior.\n\n===Serpentine===\nThe Serpentine are a warrior race of humanoid serpents. Originally a race created by the First Spinjitzu Master, they held a prophecy that foretold the coming of the Golden Master. Their attempts to warn the humans resulted in a war that culminated with them being driven underground, partly because both sides were manipulated by Master Chen. Released by Lloyd Garmadon, the Serpentine attempted to conquer Ninjago several times under the leadership of Pythor, Lord Garmadon, and finally Skales. However, after losing in battle to the Overlord's Stone Army, the Serpentine made a home for themselves underground and later aid the people of New Ninjago City escape the Golden Master's attack and then against Master Chen's army of fake Anacondrai.\n \n* '''The Great Devourer''' \u2013 A giant snake worshipped as a goddess by the Serpentine, known to be very dangerous and deadly with the ability to increase its size by consuming anything in its path, including its own kind. The Great Devourer is the main cause of the events in the series as it was responsible for turning Garmadon evil through its venom, and it was the Anacondrai General Pythor intended to release to exact revenge on the people of Ninjago. But the Great Devourer proved to be beyond anyone's control, swallowing Pythor and Sensei Wu alive, the former suffering side effects from exposure to the serpent's stomach acid, and running rampant on Ninjago with the Ninja unable to subdue it. However, in the end, the Ninja manage to lure the Devourer into a trap during its siege of Ninjago City, allowing Lord Garmadon to destroy the Great Devourer with the power of the Golden Weapons in revenge for the grief and madness it caused to him. Despite its death, the monster's venom still seeps into Ninjago City's sewage system, eventually reawakening the Stone Army. However, the Stone Army was eventually destroyed, and upon the Overlord Dragon's defeat Garmadon was cleansed of the Devourer's venom and its effects. It's proven to be female in season 7.\n* Anacondrai \u2013 An honor-bound anaconda-type Serpentine tribe that is the most feared of the Serpentine, able to turn themselves invisible. They are known for their purple coloration, and unlike other Serpentine tribes they all-not just their generals-have snake tails in place of legs. While their leading members were exiled to the Cursed Realm, the rest of the Anacondrai were trapped underground and apparently resorted to cannibalism until only Pythor remained. However, Master Chen and his group of cultists sought to bring them back, using dark magic to become Anacondrai themselves.\n** '''Pythor P. Chumsworth''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The General and last remaining member of the Anacondrai Tribe and former Snake King of the Serpentine, unique among his kind due to his elongated neck and habit of swallowing people larger than himself. Unlike his kind, Pythor is cowardly and dishonest yet has an arrogant sense of pride. While his tribe were sealed away, the Anacondrai Tribe had no food source and ultimately fell to starvation with Pythor becoming the sole survivor. Upon being released, Pythor pretended to be Lloyd's ally to steal the map to the Serpentine tombs to release the Constrictai and the Venomari Tribes. Soon after finding the lost city of Ouroborus, through deceit and an alliance with Skales, Pythor becomes the first Snake King of all Serpentine. It becomes clear soon that Pythor had been driven insane by his imprisonment and his hatred of the surface dwellers, using the allegiance of the tribes to unleash the Great Devourer to exact revenge on people of Ninjago for locking up the Serpentine underground. As the series progressed, Pythor finally managed to collect all four Silver Fang Blades, despite the oppression from the Ninja, Lord Garmadon, and the Skulkin, realizing too late that the Great Devourer would consume everything in its path, including himself alongside Sensei Wu. In season 3, Pythor is revealed to have survived his ordeal within the Great Devourer's stomach with his scales bleached white as he went into hiding. Still bent on revenge against the humans, Pythor aids the Overlord by converting Sensei Wu into Tech Wu and then tricking the ninja into giving him a beacon leading him to Lloyd. This season also revealed a fascination with a breed of electric eel/water snake known as electrocobrai, which he used as a power source for the Overlord and his creations. He swallows the shrinking pill that was meant for the Overlord in \"The Titanium Ninja\" and is chased by the Falcon. In season four he is among the many inmates of Kryptarium Prison-living in a dollhouse inside of a cell-and reveals to the ninja that the Anacondrai were tricked into attacking the humans during the war. He is captured by Chen and his sweat is used to make the Fake Anacondrai permanent, but he manages to discover a means of defeating them by releasing the spirits of the Anacondrai Generals. In gratitude for finally making them proud, Arcturus restores Pythor to his original size, though not his former coloration. He appears to be fond of the name \"Rodrigo\", as he applied this name to a toy basketball he owned while in prison and a rat that he tamed and rode into the final battle with the Anacondrai Cult.\n** '''General Arcturus''' (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) \u2013 General and leader of the Anacondrai Tribe and Supreme Leader of the Serpentine during the First Serpentine War. He and the other Anacondrai generals were banished to the Cursed Realm after being defeated by the Elemental Alliance. The ghosts of the Anacondrai generals were later freed in order to defeat Chen's Anacondrai Cultist Army.\n* Hypnobrai \u2013 A [[cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe that specializes in mind-control. They were locked in a frozen tomb in a tundra. All of them have red eyes they use to hypnotize victims (which explains that their name is a pun on \"Hypnotize\"). The symbol of the staff and the Hypnobrai has a hypnotizing shape like a swirl. Their color is blue.\n** '''Skales''' (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) - Leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe and current Snake King of Serpentine following the perceived death of Pythor. Originally ranked a warrior, Skales became general after challenging and defeating then general Slithraa. After being defeated time and time again by the Ninja he and the rest of the Serpentine found themselves trapped underground by the Stone Army. The Serpentine then reformed, took an oath of [[pacifism]], and began to live peacefully alongside the other inhabitants of Ninjago. Skales settled down, started a family, and has assisted the Ninja in matters relating to snakes. Like all Hypnobrai, Skales can [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] his foes if they stare into his eyes. He is also a master of the ancient art of Fang-kwon-do.\n** '''Slithraa''' (voiced by [[John Novak]]) \u2013 The former leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe. After accidentally hypnotizing himself, he became a servant to Lloyd Garmadon and led his tribe in accomplishing the childish schemes of the young boy. Frustrated by being ordered around by a boy, Skales saw an opportunity to rise in power. After another failed scheme, Slithraa was challenged by Skales to a match in the Slither Pit for the right to lead the Hypnobrai. Slithraa was subsequently defeated by Skales and demoted to warrior.\n* Fangpyre \u2013 A [[pit viper]]-type Serpentine tribe who specializes in venomous bites that transforms the victim into a Serpentine (depending on their element) with snake-like traits. Strangely if a Fangpyre bites a vehicle, it transforms instantly. But if they bite a person, it takes a long time for them to transform (probably because the person's immune system fights the transformation). Their anti-venom, as with the other Serpentine Tribes, is located inside the staff of their tribe. If a Fangpyre bites another Fangpyre, the Fangpyre grows another head, resulting in the slightly comedic quirk that each head speaks halves or thirds of a sentence if it is long enough. The sign of the staff and the Fangpyre are fangs with a snake tongue sticking out.\n** '''Fangtom''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]]) \u2013 The two-headed leader and General of the Fangpyre Tribe.

They're also the shortest and the dumbest of all Serpentine tribes, but they are second strongest after the Anacondrai. The sign of the staff and the Constrictai is orange and has three rings connecting to each other representing constricting. The anti-venom in the staff awakens those knocked out when being choked. They were sealed within the Mountain of a Million Steps until released by Pythor.\n** '''Skalidor''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The powerful leader and general of the Constrictai Tribe. Like all Constrictai, Skalidor has the ability to burrow underground and possesses abundant strength.\n* Venomari \u2013 A [[spitting cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe with odd tusks and multiple eyes who specializes in spitting a hallucination-inducing venom. They were sealed in a tomb within the Poisonous Bogs until Pythor released them. The symbol of the staff and the Venomari is green with drops of venom coming out of the symbol.\n** '''Acidicus''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]) \u2013 The intelligent leader and general of the Venomari Tribe.

Joined by the Elemental Cobras and Fire Fang, they're led by Queen Aspheera to wreak havoc on Ninjago, acquire the Forbidden Scroll and banish Master Wu to the Never-Realm.

In exchange for learning combat, she released Garmadon and Wu from the dungeons after they trespassed on the valley against their father's law. Based on Aspheera's development, she and Wu became friends for the next few months/years, and Wu has her master Spinjitzu. However she betrays her promise to Wu, to never use Spinjitzu for evil, and overthrows King Mambo with the intention to conquer Ninjago for herself. Garmadon and Wu arm themselves with the Forbidden Scrolls on staffs and defeat Aspheera in the throne room. She blames Wu for not teaching her Forbidden Spinjitzu and turning on her, believing that her actions of mutiny were acceptable. When she's sentenced to magical entombment, she swears vengeance on Wu. Around a thousand years later, Jay and Nya accidentally set her free when the Ninja are exploring the pyramid in the Desert of Doom. It was a vision predicted by Zane since the season's beginning. Aspheera steals Kai's fire powers and revives the mummified Serpentines. She destroys the pyramid, summons an army of cobras and her Fire Fang serpent. She comes to conflict with the Ninja multiple times upon seizing the Forbidden Scroll. She corners Wu, Kai, Jay, and Cole in the Monastery's cave, and fights P.I.X.A.L.'s Titan Mech. The fight is joined by Lloyd, Nya, and Zane, who have found the second Forbidden Scroll. Aspheera is defeated by Zane and locked in Kryptarium Prison in Garmadon's cell, but not before banishing Zane to the forsaken Never-Realm.\n** '''Char''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) - Aspheera's second in command, who displays attraction to his mistress and immense loyalty.

They have the ability to turn other living things into ghosts, and some of them can infuse their ghostly energy into vehicles and objects. As ghosts they are immune to most forms of physical attack, but are vulnerable to water as it is ever changing, which can cause them to dissolve into ectoplasm. Their only other vulnerability is to Deepstone, a substance mined from beneath the ocean floor, which can either contain them or be forged into weapons for use against them, such as the Aeroblades the ninja obtain from Ronin.

After Garmadon sacrificed himself and was sent into the Cursed Realm, Lloyd left the team to cope with losing his father. The remaining members meet the new threat Ronin, a mercenary, who partially erases the Ninja's memories. The Ninja travel to the Toxic Bogs, after which they have a vision of weapons that can restore their memories. They collect the weapons and go to see Lloyd, who takes them to see his mother for help. Once they find the Primal Fulcrum, the Ninja free Lloyd's mother from Ronin's control. Ronin freezes them and grabs the remaining elemental forges. He plans to use the Fulcrum to bring back Chen from the Cursed Realm. The Ninja chase Ronin into a portal, where the Ninja have a final battle with Ronin; he escapes and knocks the Ninja's weapons into the abyss. The ending reveals the game was a story told by Kai. In an epilogue, Dareth steals the Helmet of Darkness to control the Stone Army.
