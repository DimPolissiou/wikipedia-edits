The [[pharmacogenomics]] of the opioid receptors and their [[endogenous]] [[ligands]] have been the subject of intensive activity in association studies. These studies test broadly for a number of [[phenotypes]], including opioid dependence, [[cocaine dependence]], [[alcohol dependence]], [[Methamphetamine|methamphetamine dependence]]/[[Stimulant psychosis|psychosis]], response to naltrexone treatment, personality traits, and others. [[Substance dependence#Genetic Factors|Major and minor variants]] have been reported for every receptor and ligand coding gene in both coding sequences, as well as regulatory regions.\nNewer approaches shift away from analysis of specific genes and regions, and are based on an unbiased screen of genes across the entire genome, which have no apparent relationship to the phenotype in question. These [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] studies yield a number of implicated genes, although many of them code for seemingly unrelated proteins in processes such as [[cell adhesion]], [[transcriptional regulation]], cell structure determination, and [[RNA]], [[DNA]], and protein handling/modifying.<ref name=\"pmid23872493\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall FS, Drgonova J, Jain S, Uhl GR | title = Implications of genome wide association studies for addiction: are our a priori assumptions all wrong? | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 267\u201379 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23872493 | pmc = 3797854 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.07.006 }}</ref>\n\n====118A>G variant====\nWhile over 100 variants have been identified for the opioid mu-receptor, the most studied mu-receptor variant is the non-synonymous 118A>G variant, which results in functional changes to the receptor, including lower binding site availability, reduced [[mRNA]] levels, altered signal transduction, and increased affinity for [[beta-endorphin]]. In theory, all of these functional changes would reduce the impact of [[exogenous]] opioids, requiring a higher dose to achieve the same therapeutic effect. This points to a potential for greater addictive capacity in these individuals who require higher dosages to achieve pain control. However, evidence linking the 118A>G variant to opioid dependence is mixed, with associations shown in a number of study groups, but negative results in other groups.

In theory, all of these functional changes would reduce the impact of [[exogenous]] opioids, requiring a higher dose to achieve the same therapeutic effect.
