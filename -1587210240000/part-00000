[[Royal Library of Belgium|Biblioth\u00e8que Royale]], Brussels.]]\n\nLittle is known of his early career. He was born at Gueschard, between [[Abbeville]] and [[Hesdin]], in what is now the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] [[Department (administrative division)|department]], but was then in Picardy, and from 1435 part of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]].<ref>It was ceded in the 1435 [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]].  Gueschard was a ''commune'' in 1854, but now appears to have been swallowed up by Abbeville.</ref>  He was recruited by the Duke after he translated and adapted the [[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]] into French in 1448, and as well as his court salary he was made a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of Saint Peter's in [[Lille]] in 1453, serving until his death in 1472, when he was buried in the church.  He was probably not usually resident.<ref>Wilson & Wilson, p.59, though Arlima (external link) say he was made a canon in 1452.</ref>  As a priest and as an employee of the court he would have been exempt from [[guild]] regulations, which was probably an advantage to his career.<ref>T Kren & S McKendrick, 19</ref> He seems to have had lodgings in the palace, which are perhaps realistically shown in a miniature in Brussels,<ref>below and [http://www.notaquadrata.ca/table.html Brussels Royal Library, MS 9278, fol. 10r] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617162038/http://www.notaquadrata.ca/table.html |date=2008-06-17 }}</ref> and also to have run a workshop of scribes in [[Lille]].  After the [[Feast of the Pheasant]] in 1454, an enthusiasm in the Court to revive the [[Crusades]] led to commissions to translate travel books about the Middle East.\n\nBecause of the particular Burgundian fashion for [[presentation miniature]]s, where the author is shown presenting the book (in which the miniature itself is contained) to the Duke or another patron, we have an unusually large number of portraits of Mi\u00e9lot for a non-royal person of the period, which mostly show consistent facial features - he would have been very well known to the artists, and may well have had influence in allocating commissions to them.  These are in books he wrote - in both senses of the word, as he usually scribed Philip's copy himself.<ref>[http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/arth/arth214_folder/burgundian_frontispieces.html Two further images of Mi\u00e9lot are shown here]</ref>\n\nPhilip the Good was the leading bibliophile of Northern Europe, and employed a number of scribes, copyists and artists, with Mi\u00e9lot holding a leading position among the former groups (see also [[David Aubert]]). His translations were first produced in draft form, called a \"minute\", with sketches of the images and illuminated letters. If this was approved by the Duke, after being examined and read aloud at court, then the final ''de luxe'' manuscript for the Duke's library would be produced on fine [[vellum]], and with the sketches worked up by specialist artists. Mi\u00e9lot's ''minute'' for his ''Le Miroir de l'Humaine Salvation'' survives in the Biblioth\u00e8que Royale Albert I in [[Brussels]], which includes two [[self-portrait]]s of him richly dressed as a layman.<ref>Wilson & Wilson, pp.50-60.

{"title_page": "Elinor Mordaunt", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n'''Elinor Mordaunt''' (also known as '''Evelyn May Clowes''' and '''Evelyn May Mordaunt''') (7 May 1872 \u2013 25 June 1942) was an English author, writer and traveller.\n\n==Early life==\nElinor was the fifth child of John Legh Clowes and his wife the Hon. Mrs Elizabeth Caroline Clowes ''n\u00e9e'' Bingham and was born at [[Cotgrave]], Nottinghamshire, England and was christened Evelyn May Clowes. Her early childhood was spent at Charlton House near [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire, and her teenage years near Heythrop, in the [[Cotswolds]].\n\n==Australia==\nIn 1897 she went to [[Mauritius]] as companion to her cousin Caroline (wife of [[George Le Hunte]]) and in 1898 married a planter there named Wiehe. She gave birth to two stillborn children. After a few years of marriage, Mrs Wiehe found it impossible to live with her husband and returned to England. Shortly afterwards she went to Australia, arriving 10 June 1902 and lived at [[Melbourne]] for about eight years. Her son, Godfrey Weston Wiehe, was born 9 March 1903. \n\nIt was necessary for Mordaunt to earn a living and while in Melbourne she edited a woman's fashion paper, wrote short stories and articles, made blouses, designed embroideries, tilled gardens, acted as a housekeeper, and did artistic work. Her health was not strong, but she undertook any kind of work which would provide a living for herself and her infant son. This gained her an experience of life which was of the greatest use to her as an author.\n\n==Writings==\nMordaunt's first book, the ''Garden of Contentment'', was published in England in 1902 under her pen-name 'Elenor Mordaunt'. At Melbourne she published a volume of sketches, ''Rosemary, That's for Remembrance'' (1909), and in 1911 appeared ''On the Wallaby through [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'', by E. M. Clowes, an interesting account of conditions in that state at that period. Returning to England on 14 July 1909 she soon began a long series of volumes of fiction. She changed her name by deed poll to Evelyn May Mordaunt on 1 July 1915 .She established a reputation as a writer of short stories for magazines. Mrs Mordaunt travelled in the [[East Indies]] and adjacent islands and used her experiences in her fiction, and in travel books such as ''The Venture Book'', ''The Further Venture Book'', and ''Purely for Pleasure''. Her autobiography, ''Sinabada'', published in 1937, includes an account of her early life in Australia with appreciative reference to the kindnesses she had received. Her son by her first marriage was alive when she was writing ''Sinabada''; she mentions that he had married and had children. On 27 January 1933 at [[Tenerife]], Canary Islands, she was married to Robert Rawnsley Bowles, aged 66, a retired barrister from Gloucestershire. In her own words, the marriage 'ended in tragedy'.  \nShe died on 25 June 1942 at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. \n\nPossibly her best work was put into her short stories, often showing a grim sense of tragedy and humour. A collection of them appeared in 1934, ''The Tales of Elinor Mordaunt''. In addition to the volumes included in Miller, she was also the author of ''Death it is, Judge Not, Hobby Horse, Roses in December, Tropic Heat, Here Too is Valour'', and ''Blitz Kids''. Mordaunt was revealed as the author of a pseudonymous novel called ''Gin and Bitters'', referencing the debate in the London publishing world over whether [[Somerset Maugham]] had based the character of Alroy Kear in ''[[Cakes and Ale]]'' on [[Hugh Walpole]]. The book was removed from sale in the UK, apparently under pressure from Maugham.<ref>Maugham, S. ''Cakes and Ale'' (introduction to Modern Library edition).
