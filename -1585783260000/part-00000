It was completed over a period of little more than three and a half months, beginning on 2 March 1952 and finishing on 22 June 1952. The reason for the changes was a desire to start the next season in the fall of 1952, thus implementing the fall-spring format that had become a norm all across Europe by this time.\n\nThe clubs were initially divided into two groups of six teams each, where everyone within a given group played each other twice (home and away).\n\nThen, according to the placement in  these preliminary groups, three new groups were formed:\n*First two teams in each of the two preliminary groups advanced to the 4-team group, the winner of which would become a champion.\n*Teams placed 3rd and 4th in each of the two preliminary groups got to move to a 4-team group that would decide final league standings from 5th to 8th place.\n*The bottom two teams in each of the two preliminary groups moved to a 4-team group that would decide final league standings at the bottom (places 9th through 12th) and thus determine who gets relegated to the Second League.\n\n==League==\n\n===Preliminary stage===\n\n====Group

Yugoslavia's 1952 season''' (colloquially the '''Yugoslav First League''') was shortened and sped-up. It was completed over a period of little more than three and a half months, beginning on 2 March 1952 and finishing on 22 June 1952. The reason for the changes was a desire to start the next season in the fall of 1952, thus implementing the fall-spring format that had become a norm all across Europe by this time.\n\nThe clubs were initially divided into two groups of six teams each, where everyone within a given group played each other twice (home and away).\n\nThen, according to the placement in  these preliminary groups, three new groups were formed:\n*First two teams in each of the two preliminary groups advanced to the 4-team group, the winner of which would become a champion.\n*Teams placed 3rd and 4th in each of the two preliminary groups got to move to a 4-team group that would decide final league standings from 5th to 8th place.\n*The bottom two teams in each of the two preliminary groups moved to a 4-team group that would decide final league standings at the bottom (places 9th through 12th) and thus determine who gets relegated to the Second League.\n\n==League==\n\n===Preliminary stage===\n\n====Group

The varieties of Hunza and Nagar diverge slightly, but are clearly dialects of a single language. The Yasin variety, also known by the Khowar exonym ''Werchikwar'', is much more divergent. Intelligibility between Hunza-Nagar and Yasin is difficult, and Yasin is sometimes considered a distinct language.<ref>Backstrom & Radloff (1992), Anderson (2006)</ref> Yasin is the least affected by [[language contact|contact with neighboring languages]], though speakers are bilingual in [[Khowar language|Khowar]]. Yasin is spoken by a quarter of Burushaski speakers.<ref>Anderson 1997: 1022</ref>\n\nIn [[India]], Jammu & Kashmir Burushaski (JKB) \"has developed divergent linguistic features which make it systematically different from the varieties spoken in Pakistan.\"<ref name=\"2006Munshi\">{{cite book|last=Munshi|first=Sadaf |title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushashki: Language, Language Contact, and Change|year=2006|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |language=English|pages=13, 19}}</ref> The dialect of Burushashki spoken in India has been influenced by [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], as well as [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Munshi|first=Sadaf |title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushashki: Language, Language Contact, and Change|year=2006|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |language=English|pages=17\u201318|quote=Linguistic influence from Urdu on JKB is primarily via second language speakers of Urdu. This is because Urdu is the second language of the people of the state of Jammu & Kashmir. On the other hand, linguistic contact with Kashmiri is mediated through first language or native speakers of Kashmiri. In addition to language contact via spoken interaction, contact with Urdu is also mediated through local media and television.

Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less \"open\" than unstressed ones ({{IPA|[i e a o u]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0254 \u028a]}}). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).\n\nBerger (1998) finds the following consonants to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]], shown below in his transcription and in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |  [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!\n!\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| m\n|\n| n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e45 {{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| p\n|ph {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}}\n| t\n|th {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n| \u1e6d {{IPA|/\u0288/}}\n|\u1e6dh {{IPA|/\u0288\u02b0/}}\n| k\n|kh {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}\n| q\n|qh {{IPA|/q\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}}\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| b\n|\n| d\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e0d {{IPA|/\u0256/}}\n|\n| g\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n|'''c''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}\n|'''ch''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02b0/}}\n|''\u0107 {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}''\n|''\u0107h {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}}''\n|'''c\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282/}}\n|'''c\u0323h''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|''j {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0291/}}{{r|footnote4|group=decimal}}''\n|\n|'''j\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0256\u0361\u0290/}}{{r|footnote5|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n| s\n|\n|''\u015b {{IPA|/\u0255/}}''\n|\n|'''\u1e63''' {{IPA|/\u0282/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| h\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n| z\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'''\u0121''' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n| r\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|\n| l\n|\n| y {{IPA|[j]}}{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n| \u1ef5 {{IPA|/\u027b/}}{{r|footnote7|group=decimal}}\n|\n| w{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes:\n{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=\n<ref name=footnote1>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[p\u02b0] ~ [p\u0361f] ~ [f]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote2>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[q\u02b0] ~ [q\u0361\u03c7] ~ [\u03c7]}}.</ref>\n<!--<ref name=footnote3>The Yasin dialect lacks aspirated affricates and uses the plain ones instead.</ref>-->\n<ref name=footnote4>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0291]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote5>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0290]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote6>Berger (1998) regards {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[j]}} as allophones of /u/ and /i/ that occur in front of stressed vowels.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote7>This phoneme has various pronunciations, all of which are rare sounds cross-linguistically.

In any case, it does not occur in the Yasin dialect, and in Hunza and Nager it does not occur at the beginning of words.</ref>\n}}\n\n==Grammar==\nBurushaski is a [[double-marking language]] and word order is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\n[[Noun]]s in Burushaski are divided into four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to [[mass noun]]s). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, ''b\u00e1alt'' means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).\n\nNoun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] consists of the noun stem, a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]] [[Affix|suffixes]]. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]]/[[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and several [[Locative case|locatives]]; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.\n\nBurushaski [[verb]]s have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and [[nominalization]]; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for [[grammatical conjunction|coordination]]. [[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]] on the verb has both [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative]] and [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.\n\n== Nouns ==\n\n=== Noun classes ===\nIn Burushaski, there are four [[noun class]]es, similar to declensional classes in [[Indo-European languages]], but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical \"genders\":\n* '''m''' = male human beings, gods and spirits\n* '''f''' = female human beings and spirits\n* '''x''' = animals, [[countable]] nouns\n* '''y''' = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns\n\nBelow, the abbreviation \"'''h'''\" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while \"'''hx'''\" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.\n\nHowever, these rules are not universal \u2013 countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. ''ha'', 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes \u2013 for example, ''bay\u00fa'', when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjectives]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and other attributes must be in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun class of their subject.\n\n=== Pluralisation ===\nThere are two [[grammatical number|numbers]] in Burushaski: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:\n* '''h-class''': possible suffixes -ting, -aro, -daro, -taro, -tsaro\n* '''h- and x-class''': possible suffixes -o, -i\u0161o, -ko, -iko, -juko; -ono, -u; -i, -ai; -ts, -uts, -muts, -umuts; -nts, -ants, -ints, -iants, -ingants, -ents, -onts\n* '''y-class''': possible suffixes -ng, -ang, -ing, -iang; -eng, -ong, -ongo; -ming, -\u010ding, -i\u010ding, -mi\u010ding, -i\u010dang (Nagar dialect)\n\nSome nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. ''bras'' 'rice', ''gur'' 'wheat', ''bishk\u00e9'', 'fur', (cf. [[plurale tantum]]). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. ''hag\u00far'' 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. ''bur\u00fam'' 'white' gives the x-class plural ''burum-i\u0161o'' and the y-class plural ''bur\u00fam-ing''.\n\nExamples of pluralisation in Burushaski:\n* ''waz\u00edir'' (m), pl. ''waz\u00edirishu'' 'vizier, minister'\n* ''hir'' (m), pl. ''huri'' 'man' (stress shifts)\n* ''gus'' (f), pl. ''gush\u00ednga'' 'woman' (stress shifts)\n* ''das\u00edn'' (f), pl. ''daseyoo'' 'girl', 'unmarried woman'\n* ''huk'' (x), pl. ''huk\u00e1'' 'dog'\n* ''thely'' (x), pl. ''til\u00ed'' 'walnut'\n* ''thely'' (y), pl. ''theleng'' 'walnut tree'\n\n=== Declension ===\nBurushaski is an [[ergativity|ergative]] language. It has five primary [[case (linguistics)|cases]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Case\n!Suffix\n!Function\n|-\n| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] || unmarked || The subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive ones.\n|-\n| [[Ergative case|Ergative]] || ''-e'' || The subject of transitive verbs.\n|-\n| [[Oblique case|Oblique]] || ''-e''; ''-mo'' (f)|| [[Genitive]]; the basis of secondary case endings\n|-\n| [[Dative case|Dative]] || ''-ar'', ''-r'' || Dative, [[allative]].\n|-\n| [[Ablative case|Ablative]] || ''-um'', ''-m'', ''-mo'' || Indicates separation (e.g. 'from where?')\n|}\n\nThe case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. ''Hus\u00e9iniukutse'', 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:\n* ''hir-e'' 'the man's', ''gus-mo'' 'the woman's' (gen.)\n* ''hir-ar'' 'to the man', ''gus-mu-r'' 'to the woman' (dat.)\n\nThe genitive is placed before the thing possessed: ''Hunzue tham'', 'the Emir of Hunza.'\n\nThe endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:\n\n# ''-ts-'' 'at'\n# ''-ul-'' 'in'\n# ''-a\u1e6d-'' 'on; with'\n# ''-al-'' 'near' (only in the Hunza dialect)\n\nFrom these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Infix\n!Locative\n!Terminative\n!Ablative\n|-\n| '''-ts-''' || ''-ts-e'' 'at' || ''-ts-ar'' 'to' || ''-ts-um'' 'from'\n|-\n| '''-ul-''' || ''-ul-e'' 'in' || ''-ul-ar'' 'into' || ''-ul-um'' 'out of'\n|-\n| '''-a\u1e6d-''' || ''-a\u1e6d-e'' 'on','with' || ''-a\u1e6d-ar'' 'up to' || ''-a\u1e6d-um'' 'down from'\n|-\n| '''-al-''' || ''-al-e'' 'near' || ''-al-ar'' 'to' || ''-al-um'' 'from'\n|}\n\nThe regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.\n\n=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===\nNouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root ''mi'' 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:\n* ''i-mi'' 'his mother', ''mu-mi'' 'her mother', \"gu-mi\" 'your mother'(3f sg.), ''u-mi'' 'their mother' (3h pl.), ''u-mi-tsaro'' 'their mothers'(3h pl.).\n\nThe pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and \u2013 in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>Noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-'', ''me-''\n|-\n| 2nd person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'', ''go-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''y-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-''\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. ''khin'' 'he, this one here', but ''in'', 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.\n\n== Numerals ==\nThe Burushaski number system is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 ''altar'', 40 ''alto-altar'' (2 times 20), 60 ''iski-altar'' (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:\n* 1 ''han'' (or ''hen'', ''hak'')\n* 2 ''alt\u00f3'' (or ''alt\u00e1n'')\n* 3 ''isko'' (or ''iskey'')\n* 4 ''w\u00e1lto''\n* 5 ''\u010dind\u00f3''\n* 6 ''mish\u00edndo''\n* 7 ''thal\u00f3''\n* 8 ''alt\u00e1mbo''\n* 9 ''hunch\u00f3''\n* 10 ''t\u00f3orumo'' (also ''toorimi'' and ''turma'')\n* 100 ''tha''\n\nExamples of compound numerals:\n\n11 ''turma-han'', 12 ''turma-alto'', 13 ''turma-isko'', ... , 19 ''turma-hunti'';\n20 ''altar'', 30 ''altar-toorumo'', 40 ''alto-altar'', 50 ''alto-altar-toorumo'', 60 ''iski-altar'' and so on;\n21 ''altar-hak'', 22 ''altar-alto'', 23 ''altar-isko'' and so on.\n\n==Verbs==\n\n===Overview===\nThe verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[deletion (linguistics)|deletion]] and [[Accent (dialect)|accent shift]], which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.\n\nThe Burushaski [[finite verb]] falls into the following categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Category\n!Possible forms\n|-\n| [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]/[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] || Present, [[Future tense|Future]], [[Imperfect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]], [[Pluperfect]]\n|-\n| [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] || [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], three [[Optative]]s, [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Conative]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical number|Number]] || Singular, [[Plural]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|Person]] || 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person (2nd person only in the imperative).\n|-\n| [[Noun class]] || the four noun classes m, f, x and y (only in the 3rd person)\n|}\n\nFor many [[transitive verb]]s, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The [[infinitive]] forms \u2013 which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives \u2013 admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.\n\n=== The 11 positions of the finite verb ===\nAll verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions\n* '''The positions of Burushaski finite verbs'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Position\n!Affixes and their meanings\n|-\n| 1 || Negative prefix ''a-''\n|-\n| 2a/b || d-prefix (creates intransitive verbs) / n-prefix (absolutive prefix)\n|-\n| 3 || '''Pronominal prefixes''': subject of intransitive, object of transitive verbs\n|-\n| 4 || s-prefix (creates secondary transitive verbs)\n|- style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"\n|| 5 || style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"| '''Verb Stem'''\n|-\n| 6 || Plural suffix ''-ya-'' on the verb stem\n|-\n| 7 || Present stem mark ''-\u010d-'' (or ''\u0161'', ''ts''..) forming the present, future and imperfect\n|-\n| 8a/b || '''Pronominal suffix''' of the 1.sg.

The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -\u010d- in position 7.

A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:\n* '''Personal prefix''' (Position 3)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-''\n|-\n| 2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-''\n|}\n* '''Personal suffixes''' (Positions 8 and 10)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st/2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-a'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-o'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-ie''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i''\n|}\n\nFor example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb ''phus'' 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :\n* ''i-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties him\" (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)\n* ''mu-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties her (f)\"\n* ''u-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties them (pl. hx)\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-an'' \"we/you/they tie him\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-an'' \"you/they tie us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie it\"\n* ''gu-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie you\"\n\nThe personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. ''hir i-\u00edr-i-mi'' 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:\n* ''gu-ir-\u010d-u-m-a'' \"you will die\" (future)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he sank\" (preterite)\n\nPersonal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:\n* ''hur\u00fa\u1e6d-i-m-i'' \"he sat down\" (volitional action without prefix)\n* ''i-\u00edr-i-m-i'' \"he died\" (involuntary action with prefix)\n* ''ghurts-i-mi'' \"he went willingly underwater\", \"he dove\" (without prefix)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he went unwillingly underwater\", \"he sank\" (with prefix)\n\n=== The d- prefix ===\nA number of verbs \u2013 mostly according to their root form \u2013 are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to [[vowel harmony]]. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:\n* ''i-phalt-i-mi'' 'he breaks it open' (transitive)\n* ''du-phalt-as'' 'to break open, to explode' (intransitive)\n\nA master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in the Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc271839/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|title=MIDDLE VOICE CONSTRUCTION IN BURUSHASKI: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HUNZA DIALECT|last=Karim|first=Piar B.A.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to \"indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity\" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* ''hiles dd-i-il-imi''  'the boy drenched'\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Burushaski comparative vocabulary list|Burushaski comparative vocabulary list]] ([[Wiktionary]])\n* [[Partawi Shah]]\n* [[Languages of Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, Gregory D.

Television is also a source of linguistic influence from Hindi, which is very close to Urdu.}}</ref> Unique to JKB is the features of [[Syncope (phonology)|vowel syncopation]].<ref name=\"Munshi2006\"/> Jammu & Kashmir Burushaski shares more similarities with the dialect spoken in Nagar than with that spoken in Hunza.<ref name=\"2006Munshi\"/>\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Arabic-script sidebar|Burushaski}}\nBurushaski is a predominantly spoken rather than written language.

Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less \"open\" than unstressed ones ({{IPA|[i e a o u]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[\u026a \u025b \u028c \u0254 \u028a]}}). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).\n\nBerger (1998) finds the following consonants to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]], shown below in his transcription and in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |  [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |  [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!\n!\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| m\n|\n| n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e45 {{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| p\n|ph {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}}\n| t\n|th {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n| \u1e6d {{IPA|/\u0288/}}\n|\u1e6dh {{IPA|/\u0288\u02b0/}}\n| k\n|kh {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}\n| q\n|qh {{IPA|/q\u02b0/}}{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}}\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| b\n|\n| d\n|\n|\n|\n| \u1e0d {{IPA|/\u0256/}}\n|\n| g\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n|'''c''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}\n|'''ch''' {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02b0/}}\n|''\u0107 {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}''\n|''\u0107h {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}}''\n|'''c\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282/}}\n|'''c\u0323h''' {{IPA|/\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02b0/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|''j {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0291/}}{{r|footnote4|group=decimal}}''\n|\n|'''j\u0323''' {{IPA|/\u0256\u0361\u0290/}}{{r|footnote5|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n|\n|\n| s\n|\n|''\u015b {{IPA|/\u0255/}}''\n|\n|'''\u1e63''' {{IPA|/\u0282/}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| h\n|-\n!<small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n|\n|\n| z\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'''\u0121''' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n|\n| r\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|\n| l\n|\n| y {{IPA|[j]}}{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n| \u1ef5 {{IPA|/\u027b/}}{{r|footnote7|group=decimal}}\n|\n| w{{r|footnote6|group=decimal}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes:\n{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=\n<ref name=footnote1>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[p\u02b0] ~ [p\u0361f] ~ [f]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote2>Pronunciation varies: {{IPA|[q\u02b0] ~ [q\u0361\u03c7] ~ [\u03c7]}}.</ref>\n<!--<ref name=footnote3>The Yasin dialect lacks aspirated affricates and uses the plain ones instead.</ref>-->\n<ref name=footnote4>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0291]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote5>Sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[\u0290]}}.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote6>Berger (1998) regards {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[j]}} as allophones of /u/ and /i/ that occur in front of stressed vowels.</ref>\n<ref name=footnote7>This phoneme has various pronunciations, all of which are rare sounds cross-linguistically.

In any case, it does not occur in the Yasin dialect, and in Hunza and Nager it does not occur at the beginning of words.</ref>\n}}\n\n==Grammar==\nBurushaski is a [[double-marking language]] and word order is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]].\n\n[[Noun]]s in Burushaski are divided into four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to [[mass noun]]s). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, ''b\u00e1alt'' means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).\n\nNoun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] consists of the noun stem, a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]] [[Affix|suffixes]]. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]]/[[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and several [[Locative case|locatives]]; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.\n\nBurushaski [[verb]]s have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and [[nominalization]]; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for [[grammatical conjunction|coordination]]. [[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]] on the verb has both [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative]] and [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.\n\n== Nouns ==\n\n=== Noun classes ===\nIn Burushaski, there are four [[noun class]]es, similar to declensional classes in [[Indo-European languages]], but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical \"genders\":\n* '''m''' = male human beings, gods and spirits\n* '''f''' = female human beings and spirits\n* '''x''' = animals, [[countable]] nouns\n* '''y''' = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns\n\nBelow, the abbreviation \"'''h'''\" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while \"'''hx'''\" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.\n\nHowever, these rules are not universal \u2013 countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. ''ha'', 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes \u2013 for example, ''bay\u00fa'', when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjectives]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and other attributes must be in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun class of their subject.\n\n=== Pluralisation ===\nThere are two [[grammatical number|numbers]] in Burushaski: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:\n* '''h-class''': possible suffixes -ting, -aro, -daro, -taro, -tsaro\n* '''h- and x-class''': possible suffixes -o, -i\u0161o, -ko, -iko, -juko; -ono, -u; -i, -ai; -ts, -uts, -muts, -umuts; -nts, -ants, -ints, -iants, -ingants, -ents, -onts\n* '''y-class''': possible suffixes -ng, -ang, -ing, -iang; -eng, -ong, -ongo; -ming, -\u010ding, -i\u010ding, -mi\u010ding, -i\u010dang (Nagar dialect)\n\nSome nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. ''bras'' 'rice', ''gur'' 'wheat', ''bishk\u00e9'', 'fur', (cf. [[plurale tantum]]). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. ''hag\u00far'' 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. ''bur\u00fam'' 'white' gives the x-class plural ''burum-i\u0161o'' and the y-class plural ''bur\u00fam-ing''.\n\nExamples of pluralisation in Burushaski:\n* ''waz\u00edir'' (m), pl. ''waz\u00edirishu'' 'vizier, minister'\n* ''hir'' (m), pl. ''huri'' 'man' (stress shifts)\n* ''gus'' (f), pl. ''gush\u00ednga'' 'woman' (stress shifts)\n* ''das\u00edn'' (f), pl. ''daseyoo'' 'girl', 'unmarried woman'\n* ''huk'' (x), pl. ''huk\u00e1'' 'dog'\n* ''thely'' (x), pl. ''til\u00ed'' 'walnut'\n* ''thely'' (y), pl. ''theleng'' 'walnut tree'\n\n=== Declension ===\nBurushaski is an [[ergativity|ergative]] language. It has five primary [[case (linguistics)|cases]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Case\n!Suffix\n!Function\n|-\n| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] || unmarked || The subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive ones.\n|-\n| [[Ergative case|Ergative]] || ''-e'' || The subject of transitive verbs.\n|-\n| [[Oblique case|Oblique]] || ''-e''; ''-mo'' (f)|| [[Genitive]]; the basis of secondary case endings\n|-\n| [[Dative case|Dative]] || ''-ar'', ''-r'' || Dative, [[allative]].\n|-\n| [[Ablative case|Ablative]] || ''-um'', ''-m'', ''-mo'' || Indicates separation (e.g. 'from where?')\n|}\n\nThe case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. ''Hus\u00e9iniukutse'', 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:\n* ''hir-e'' 'the man's', ''gus-mo'' 'the woman's' (gen.)\n* ''hir-ar'' 'to the man', ''gus-mu-r'' 'to the woman' (dat.)\n\nThe genitive is placed before the thing possessed: ''Hunzue tham'', 'the Emir of Hunza.'\n\nThe endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:\n\n# ''-ts-'' 'at'\n# ''-ul-'' 'in'\n# ''-a\u1e6d-'' 'on; with'\n# ''-al-'' 'near' (only in the Hunza dialect)\n\nFrom these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Infix\n!Locative\n!Terminative\n!Ablative\n|-\n| '''-ts-''' || ''-ts-e'' 'at' || ''-ts-ar'' 'to' || ''-ts-um'' 'from'\n|-\n| '''-ul-''' || ''-ul-e'' 'in' || ''-ul-ar'' 'into' || ''-ul-um'' 'out of'\n|-\n| '''-a\u1e6d-''' || ''-a\u1e6d-e'' 'on','with' || ''-a\u1e6d-ar'' 'up to' || ''-a\u1e6d-um'' 'down from'\n|-\n| '''-al-''' || ''-al-e'' 'near' || ''-al-ar'' 'to' || ''-al-um'' 'from'\n|}\n\nThe regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.\n\n=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===\nNouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root ''mi'' 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:\n* ''i-mi'' 'his mother', ''mu-mi'' 'her mother', \"gu-mi\" 'your mother'(3f sg.), ''u-mi'' 'their mother' (3h pl.), ''u-mi-tsaro'' 'their mothers'(3h pl.).\n\nThe pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and \u2013 in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>Noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-'', ''me-''\n|-\n| 2nd person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'', ''go-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''y-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-'', ''o-''\n|-\n| 3rd person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'', ''e-''\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. ''khin'' 'he, this one here', but ''in'', 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.\n\n== Numerals ==\nThe Burushaski number system is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 ''altar'', 40 ''alto-altar'' (2 times 20), 60 ''iski-altar'' (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:\n* 1 ''han'' (or ''hen'', ''hak'')\n* 2 ''alt\u00f3'' (or ''alt\u00e1n'')\n* 3 ''isko'' (or ''iskey'')\n* 4 ''w\u00e1lto''\n* 5 ''\u010dind\u00f3''\n* 6 ''mish\u00edndo''\n* 7 ''thal\u00f3''\n* 8 ''alt\u00e1mbo''\n* 9 ''hunch\u00f3''\n* 10 ''t\u00f3orumo'' (also ''toorimi'' and ''turma'')\n* 100 ''tha''\n\nExamples of compound numerals:\n\n11 ''turma-han'', 12 ''turma-alto'', 13 ''turma-isko'', ... , 19 ''turma-hunti'';\n20 ''altar'', 30 ''altar-toorumo'', 40 ''alto-altar'', 50 ''alto-altar-toorumo'', 60 ''iski-altar'' and so on;\n21 ''altar-hak'', 22 ''altar-alto'', 23 ''altar-isko'' and so on.\n\n==Verbs==\n\n===Overview===\nThe verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[deletion (linguistics)|deletion]] and [[Accent (dialect)|accent shift]], which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.\n\nThe Burushaski [[finite verb]] falls into the following categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Category\n!Possible forms\n|-\n| [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]/[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] || Present, [[Future tense|Future]], [[Imperfect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]], [[Pluperfect]]\n|-\n| [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] || [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], three [[Optative]]s, [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Conative]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical number|Number]] || Singular, [[Plural]]\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|Person]] || 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person (2nd person only in the imperative).\n|-\n| [[Noun class]] || the four noun classes m, f, x and y (only in the 3rd person)\n|}\n\nFor many [[transitive verb]]s, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The [[infinitive]] forms \u2013 which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives \u2013 admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.\n\n=== The 11 positions of the finite verb ===\nAll verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions\n* '''The positions of Burushaski finite verbs'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Position\n!Affixes and their meanings\n|-\n| 1 || Negative prefix ''a-''\n|-\n| 2a/b || d-prefix (creates intransitive verbs) / n-prefix (absolutive prefix)\n|-\n| 3 || '''Pronominal prefixes''': subject of intransitive, object of transitive verbs\n|-\n| 4 || s-prefix (creates secondary transitive verbs)\n|- style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"\n|| 5 || style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"| '''Verb Stem'''\n|-\n| 6 || Plural suffix ''-ya-'' on the verb stem\n|-\n| 7 || Present stem mark ''-\u010d-'' (or ''\u0161'', ''ts''..) forming the present, future and imperfect\n|-\n| 8a/b || '''Pronominal suffix''' of the 1.sg.

The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -\u010d- in position 7. The optative and imperative are derived directly from the stem. Altogether, the schema is as follows:\n\nThe formation of the tenses and moods of the verb ''her'' 'to cry', without prefixes:\n* '''Simple stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Conative || stem + personal suffix || ''her-i'' 'he starts to cry'\n|-\n| Preterite || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix + personal suffix || ''her-i-m-i'' 'he cried'\n|-\n| Perfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + present auxiliary || ''her-a-i'' 'he has cried'\n|-\n| Pluperfect || stem [+ linking vowel] + perfect auxiliary || ''her-a-m'' 'he had cried'\n|}\n* '''Present stem tenses'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| Future || stem + present marker [+ linking vowel + m-suffix] + personal ending || ''her-\u010d-i'' 'he will cry'\n|-\n| Present || stem + present marker + linking vowel + present auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-i'' 'he is crying'\n|-\n| Imperfect || stem + present marker + linking vowel + perfect auxiliary || ''her-\u010d-a-m'' 'he was crying, used to cry'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Conditional || stem + present marker + linking vowel + m-Suffix (except 1. pl.) + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-u-m-\u010de'' '...{{nbsp}}he would cry',\n|-\n| stem + present marker + linking vowel + 1. pl. ending + ''\u010de'' || ''her-\u010d-an-\u010de'' 'we would cry'\n|}\n* '''Optatives and Imperative'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"| Grammatical<br>category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Construction\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Form and meaning\n|-\n| ''\u00e1a''-optative || stem + ''\u00e1a'' (in all persons) || ''her-\u00e1a'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\"\n|-\n| ''m''-optative || stem [+ linking vowel] + m-suffix || ''her-u-m'' \"...{{nbsp}}should.. cry\u201c\n|-\n| ''\u0161''-optative || stem + ''(i)\u0161'' + personal suffix || ''her-\u0161-an'' \"he should cry\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>singular || stem [+ ''\u00e9'' for ending-accented verbs] || ''her'' \"cry!\"\n|-\n| Imperative<br>plural || stem + ''in'' || ''her-in'' \"cry!\"\n|}\n\n=== Indication of the subject and object ===\nThe subject and object of the verb are indicated by the use of personal prefixes and suffixes in positions 3, 8 and 10 as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Affix\n!Position\n!Function\n|-\n| Prefixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3 || direct object of transitive verbs, subject of intransitive ones\n|-\n| Suffixes || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8/10 || subject of transitive and intransitive verbs\n|}\n\nThe personal prefixes are identical to the pronominal prefixes of nouns (mandatory with body parts and kinship terms, as above). A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:\n* '''Personal prefix''' (Position 3)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''a-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mi-''\n|-\n| 2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''gu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''ma-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''mu-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''u-''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''i-''\n|}\n* '''Personal suffixes''' (Positions 8 and 10)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c0f0f0;\"\n!Person/<br>noun class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n| 1st/2nd Person || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-a'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person m || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person f || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-o'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-an''\n|-\n| 3rd Person x || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i'' || style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-ie''\n|-\n| 3rd Person y || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''-i''\n|}\n\nFor example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb ''phus'' 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :\n* ''i-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties him\" (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)\n* ''mu-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties her (f)\"\n* ''u-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties them (pl. hx)\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-i'' \"he ties us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-an'' \"we/you/they tie him\"\n* ''mi-phus-i-m-an'' \"you/they tie us\"\n* ''i-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie it\"\n* ''gu-phus-i-m-a'' \"I tie you\"\n\nThe personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. ''hir i-\u00edr-i-mi'' 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:\n* ''gu-ir-\u010d-u-m-a'' \"you will die\" (future)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he sank\" (preterite)\n\nPersonal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:\n* ''hur\u00fa\u1e6d-i-m-i'' \"he sat down\" (volitional action without prefix)\n* ''i-\u00edr-i-m-i'' \"he died\" (involuntary action with prefix)\n* ''ghurts-i-mi'' \"he went willingly underwater\", \"he dove\" (without prefix)\n* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' \"he went unwillingly underwater\", \"he sank\" (with prefix)\n\n=== The d- prefix ===\nA number of verbs \u2013 mostly according to their root form \u2013 are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to [[vowel harmony]]. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:\n* ''i-phalt-i-mi'' 'he breaks it open' (transitive)\n* ''du-phalt-as'' 'to break open, to explode' (intransitive)\n\nA master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in the Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc271839/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|title=MIDDLE VOICE CONSTRUCTION IN BURUSHASKI: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HUNZA DIALECT|last=Karim|first=Piar B.A.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to \"indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity\" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* ''hiles dd-i-il-imi''  'the boy drenched'\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Burushaski comparative vocabulary list|Burushaski comparative vocabulary list]] ([[Wiktionary]])\n* [[Partawi Shah]]\n* [[Languages of Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, Gregory D.

Australia|convict]] for the crime of forgery. In [[New South Wales]] he worked for the Governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]], as Australia's first government architect. He became widely known and admired for his work displayed in buildings such as [[St Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor|St Matthew's Church]] in [[Windsor, New South Wales]], [[St James' Church, Sydney]] and [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney]].<ref name=\"broadbent\">{{cite book|last=Broadbent|first=James|title=Francis Greenway Architect|year=1997|publisher=Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales|location=Glebe, N.S.W.|author2=Hughes, Joy}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nGreenway was born in [[Mangotsfield]], Gloucestershire (near the English city of [[Bristol]]), the son of Francis Greenway and Ann Webb.<ref name=\"aus-biography\">Morton Herman, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010434b.htm Greenway, Francis (1777\u20131837)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 1, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1966, pp 470\u2013473.

His only remaining building in the United Kingdom is [[the Clifton Club]] in Bristol, originally the Clifton Hotel and Assembly Rooms.
