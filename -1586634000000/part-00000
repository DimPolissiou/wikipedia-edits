Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]].

This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]].

Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s.

(whose mother had converted and brought Catholicism to what became the Diocese of [[Gar\u00f0ar, Greenland]]), his sister and at least two brothers, according to the [[Vinland Sagas]]. Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]]. Unlike their predecessor, the Jesuits began their work on Mi'kma'ki by learning the local language and living alongside the [[Mi'kmaq]] in order to instruct and convert them to Catholicism.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.74</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] purchased a tract of land in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] from Sir [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]] and established a colony, calling it Avalon, after the legendary spot where [[Christianity]] was introduced to Britain.<ref name=\"Browne, William Hand\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9kwOAAAAIAAJ |title=George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert: Barons Baltimore of Baltimore|publisher=New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company|accessdate=2013-01-23|year=1890}}</ref> In 1627 Calvert brought two Catholic priests to Avalon. This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]]. The [[Province of Avalon|Colony of Avalon]] was thus the first [[North America]]n jurisdiction to practice religious tolerance.<ref name=\"Sir George Calvert\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/avalon.html|title=Sir George Calvert and the Colony of Avalon|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===British Rule in Canada===\nIn the way of the Canada Conquest in 1759, New France became a British colony. Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s. In the fall of 1998, Newfoundland officially adopted a non-denominational school system, following two referenda and judgements by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and its Court of Appeal that constitutionally recognized the end of provincially-funded Catholic schools.<ref>The Collapse of Denominational Education\" in ''Heritage Newfoundland & Labrador'' by Jenny Higgins, 2011. \u2013, accessed May 29, 2018. https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/collapse-denominational-education.php</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\nIt appears that across Canada the [[Catholic Church]] is declining, resulting in [[Deconsecration|closures]] of more and more churches in all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of country. Identification with [[Catholicism]] (as well as to other sects of [[Christianity]]) in Canada is also declining.
