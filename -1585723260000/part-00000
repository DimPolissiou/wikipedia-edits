It is usually made during [[Diwali]] or [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], [[Onam]], [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] and other Hindu festivals in the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent.]] Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the [[art]] form and the [[tradition]] alive.\n\nThe purpose of rangoli is to feel strength, generosity, and it is thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by girls or women. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.\n\nRangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually dry or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which [[sindooram]] (vermilion), [[Turmeric|pasupu]] (turmeric) and other natural colours can be added. Chemical colors are a modern variation. Other materials include red brick powder and even flowers and petals, as in the case of flower rangolis.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKBc0p5NLdJfI8ahBM-QrVg?view_as=subscriber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKBc0p5NLdJfI8ahBM-QrVg?view_as=subscriber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKBc0p5NLdJfI8ahBM-QrVg?view_as=subscriber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKBc0p5NLdJfI8ahBM-QrVg?view_as=subscriber\n==Etymology==\nFrom Sanskrit word \"\u0930\u0919\u094d\u0917\" which means ''color''.

Dried rice flour or other forms of white dust powder is used for drawing Chaooks. Although there are numerous traditional Chaook patterns, many more can be created depending on the creativity of the person who draws it. It is considered auspicious as it signifies showering of good luck and prosperity on the house and in the family. It is not drawn like a picture. Patterns are created based on certain systems. Generally, women get up early in the morning and clean the area just outside the entrance of their houses with cow dung, sprinkle the area with water and draw the Chaook. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, rangolis are drawn on the doors of homes so that evil forces attempting to enter are repelled. During the festival of [[Onam]] in Kerala, flowers are laid down for each of the ten days of the celebration, the design growing larger and more complex every day. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and many parts of Maharashtra, the Rangoli or [[Kolam]] is drawn upon the ground or floor daily. The designs are geometric and symmetrical \u092e\u0942\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0903 shapes but the materials used are similar rangoli: rice flour or slurry is used. In Rajasthan the [[Mandana Paintings|Mandana]] are painted on walls. Mmandne, various festivals, major festivals and can be categorized based on seasons. Different shapes depending on the size of it also can be shared. Kumaon's \"writing beat 'or in a variety of plotting symbols Thapa, artistic designs, Bellbutoan is used. Alikhthap of society apart \u2013 separated by different groups \u2013 different icons and art media is used. In Odisha, the Murja is put at the aangan of every home in front of the Tulsi plant called \"Tulasi chahura\". The Rangoli patterns mostly are dedicated to Lord Krishna and Lord Jagannath. The Murja festival is observed during the auspicious month of Kartika ending on Kartika Purnima.\n\nThe Rangoli's most important element is being colourful. These are auspicious symbols that have a central role in the design. The design for generations are passed on as they are made \u2013 and is required to make these symbols. Traditionally, each new generation learns the art and thus a family keeps the tradition intact. Some major symbols used in Rangoli are the lotus flower, its leaves, mango, Tue vase, fish, different kind of birds like parrots, swans, peacocks, and human figures and foliage. Oftentimes Rangoli is made on special occasions like Diwali. Some special patterns for Diwali Rangoli are the Diya also called Deep, Ganesha, Lakshmi, flowers or birds of India.\n\nThe second key element is using the materials used to make the rangoli. The materials used are easily found everywhere. Therefore, this art is prevalent in all homes, rich or poor. Normally the major ingredients used to make rangoli are \u2013 Pise rice solution, the dried powder made from the leaves color, charcoal, burned soil was, wood sawdust, etc..\n\nThe third important element is the background. Rangoli use the background of a clear floor or wall or Llype is used. Rangoli can be made in a yard in the middle, corners, or as a bell is created around.\n\nDehri gateway is a tradition of making rangoli. God's seat, depending on lamp, place of worship and sacrifice on the altar is a tradition of decorating rangoli. With time, imagination and innovative ideas in Rangoli art is also incorporated. Hospitality and tourism has also had its effect and rangoli has been commercially developed in places such as hotels. Its traditional charm, artistry and importance still remain.\n\nRangoli is also created using coloured rice, dry flour, flower petals, turmeric (pasupu), Vermillion (Sindooram) and coloured sand. The patterns include the face of Hindu deities, geometric shapes peacock motifs, and round floral designs. Many of these motifs are traditional and are handed down by the previous generations. This makes rangoli a representation of India's rich heritage and the fact that it is a land of festivals and colour. People celebrate rangoli with davali patterns.\n\n==Creation of Rangoli==\nThere are two primary ways to make a Rangoli, dry and wet, referring to the materials used to create the outline and (if desired) fill that outline with colour. Using a white material like [[chalk]], sand, paint or flour, the artist marks a centre-point on the ground and cardinal points around it, usually in a square, hexagon or circle depending on region and personal preference. Ramifying that initially-simple pattern creates what is often an intricate and beautiful design. Motifs from nature (leaves, petals, feathers) and [[pattern|geometric patterns]] are common. Less common but by no means rare are representational forms (like a [[peacock]], icon or landscape). \"Readymade Rangoli\" patterns, often as [[stencil]]s or stickers, are becoming common, making it easier to create detailed or precise designs.\n\nOnce the outline is complete, the artist may choose to illuminate it with colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or [[pigment|dry pigments]]. The artist might also choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like [[crayon]]s, dyes or dyed fabrics, [[acrylic paints]] and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.\n\nShape, design and material can be influenced by regional traditions. A square grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; [[Onam]] Rangolis are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based on gypsum (chirodi), in South India on rice flour and Onam Rangolis are typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like sawdust-based floating Rangolis, freeform designs, and exotic materials.\n\nIt is particularly notable that the Tamil version of the Rangoli, the [[Kolam]], prizes symmetry, complexity, precision, and intricacy rather than the flamboyance of Rangolis found in North India. Many people find it enjoyable to try and figure out how such intricate designs are drawn with a grid, and hence, it allows the mind to be exercised.\n\n==Faith and beliefs==\n[[File:Rangoli_of_pongal_festival_in_India.jpg|thumb|200px|A rangoli made in front of a house]]\nIn India, there is a prevalent myth that [[Andal|Andaal]] worshipped Lord [[Thirumaal]] and was married to him in the month of Margazhi. During this month, unmarried girls get up before dawn and draw a Rangoli to welcome the God Thirumal. Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu mythology. There are also references of Rangoli in legends such as Ramayana - at Sita's wedding pavilion where there is a discussion about Rangoli. Cultural development of Rangoli in the South originated in the era of the Chola Rulers.\nThere are modern and traditional rangoli designs.

It is usually made during [[Diwali]] or [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], [[Onam]], [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] and other Hindu festivals in the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent.]] Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the [[art]] form and the [[tradition]] alive.\n\nThe purpose of rangoli is to feel strength, generosity, and it is thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by girls or women. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.\n\nRangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually dry or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which [[sindooram]] (vermilion), [[Turmeric|pasupu]] (turmeric) and other natural colours can be added. Chemical colors are a modern variation. Other materials include red brick powder and even flowers and petals, as in the case of flower rangolis.\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom Sanskrit word \"\u0930\u0919\u094d\u0917\" which means ''color''. ''Rangoli'' is derived from the Sanskrit word \u2018''rangavalli\u2019.''\n\nThe various names for this art form and similar practices include ''muggu'' (\u0c2e\u0c41\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c41) in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]], r''angoli/rangole'' (\u0cb0\u0c82\u0c97\u0ccb\u0cb2\u0cbf/\u0cb0\u0c82\u0c97\u0ccb\u0cb2\u0cc6) in [[Karnataka]], [[kolam]] (\u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb2\u0bae\u0bcd) in Tamil Nadu, ''mandana''/''mandas'' (\u092e\u093e\u0901\u0921\u0928\u093e) in [[Rajasthan]], c''howkpurana'' (\u091b\u094b\u0935\u0915\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093e) in [[Chhattisgarh]], ''[[alpana]]''/''alpona'' ([[:bn:\u0986\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09be|\u0986\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09be]]) in [[West Bengal]], ''muruja''/''marje'' (\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093e) or ''[[Jhoti chita|jhoti]]'' (\u091d\u094b\u091f\u0940) or ''[[Jhoti chita|chita]]'' (\u091a\u093f\u0924\u093e) in [[Odisha]], ''haripan''/''aripan'' (\u0906\u0930\u093f\u092a\u0928\u093e) in [[Bihar]], ''chowkpujan'' (\u091a\u094c\u0915\u092a\u0942\u091c\u0928) in [[Uttar Pradesh]], ''[[chowk poorana]]'' in Punjab, ''pookkalam'' (\u0d2a\u0d42\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d33\u0d02) in [[Kerala]],Rangoli/ ''sanskarbharti''/''bharti'' in [[Maharashtra]], ''saathiya''/''gahuli'' in [[Gujarat]], and ''aipan''/''eipan'' (\u0910\u092a\u0923) in [[Uttarakhand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/nov/06sld4.htm|title=Kolams, chowkpurana, madana, aripana...|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Rediff|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rangoli in different states==\nIn middle India mainly in Chhattisgarh Rangoli is called Chaook and is generally drawn at the entrance of a house or any other building. Dried rice flour or other forms of white dust powder is used for drawing Chaooks. Although there are numerous traditional Chaook patterns, many more can be created depending on the creativity of the person who draws it. It is considered auspicious as it signifies showering of good luck and prosperity on the house and in the family. It is not drawn like a picture. Patterns are created based on certain systems. Generally, women get up early in the morning and clean the area just outside the entrance of their houses with cow dung, sprinkle the area with water and draw the Chaook. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, rangolis are drawn on the doors of homes so that evil forces attempting to enter are repelled. During the festival of [[Onam]] in Kerala, flowers are laid down for each of the ten days of the celebration, the design growing larger and more complex every day. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and many parts of Maharashtra, the Rangoli or [[Kolam]] is drawn upon the ground or floor daily. The designs are geometric and symmetrical \u092e\u0942\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0903 shapes but the materials used are similar rangoli: rice flour or slurry is used. In Rajasthan the [[Mandana Paintings|Mandana]] are painted on walls. Mmandne, various festivals, major festivals and can be categorized based on seasons. Different shapes depending on the size of it also can be shared. Kumaon's \"writing beat 'or in a variety of plotting symbols Thapa, artistic designs, Bellbutoan is used. Alikhthap of society apart \u2013 separated by different groups \u2013 different icons and art media is used. In Odisha, the Murja is put at the aangan of every home in front of the Tulsi plant called \"Tulasi chahura\". The Rangoli patterns mostly are dedicated to Lord Krishna and Lord Jagannath. The Murja festival is observed during the auspicious month of Kartika ending on Kartika Purnima.\n\nThe Rangoli's most important element is being colourful. These are auspicious symbols that have a central role in the design. The design for generations are passed on as they are made \u2013 and is required to make these symbols. Traditionally, each new generation learns the art and thus a family keeps the tradition intact. Some major symbols used in Rangoli are the lotus flower, its leaves, mango, Tue vase, fish, different kind of birds like parrots, swans, peacocks, and human figures and foliage. Oftentimes Rangoli is made on special occasions like Diwali. Some special patterns for Diwali Rangoli are the Diya also called Deep, Ganesha, Lakshmi, flowers or birds of India.\n\nThe second key element is using the materials used to make the rangoli. The materials used are easily found everywhere. Therefore, this art is prevalent in all homes, rich or poor. Normally the major ingredients used to make rangoli are \u2013 Pise rice solution, the dried powder made from the leaves color, charcoal, burned soil was, wood sawdust, etc..\n\nThe third important element is the background. Rangoli use the background of a clear floor or wall or Llype is used. Rangoli can be made in a yard in the middle, corners, or as a bell is created around.\n\nDehri gateway is a tradition of making rangoli. God's seat, depending on lamp, place of worship and sacrifice on the altar is a tradition of decorating rangoli. With time, imagination and innovative ideas in Rangoli art is also incorporated. Hospitality and tourism has also had its effect and rangoli has been commercially developed in places such as hotels. Its traditional charm, artistry and importance still remain.\n\nRangoli is also created using coloured rice, dry flour, flower petals, turmeric (pasupu), Vermillion (Sindooram) and coloured sand. The patterns include the face of Hindu deities, geometric shapes peacock motifs, and round floral designs. Many of these motifs are traditional and are handed down by the previous generations. This makes rangoli a representation of India's rich heritage and the fact that it is a land of festivals and colour. People celebrate rangoli with davali patterns.\n\n==Creation of Rangoli==\nThere are two primary ways to make a Rangoli, dry and wet, referring to the materials used to create the outline and (if desired) fill that outline with colour. Using a white material like [[chalk]], sand, paint or flour, the artist marks a centre-point on the ground and cardinal points around it, usually in a square, hexagon or circle depending on region and personal preference. Ramifying that initially-simple pattern creates what is often an intricate and beautiful design. Motifs from nature (leaves, petals, feathers) and [[pattern|geometric patterns]] are common. Less common but by no means rare are representational forms (like a [[peacock]], icon or landscape). \"Readymade Rangoli\" patterns, often as [[stencil]]s or stickers, are becoming common, making it easier to create detailed or precise designs.\n\nOnce the outline is complete, the artist may choose to illuminate it with colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or [[pigment|dry pigments]]. The artist might also choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like [[crayon]]s, dyes or dyed fabrics, [[acrylic paints]] and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.\n\nShape, design and material can be influenced by regional traditions. A square grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; [[Onam]] Rangolis are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based on gypsum (chirodi), in South India on rice flour and Onam Rangolis are typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like sawdust-based floating Rangolis, freeform designs, and exotic materials.\n\nIt is particularly notable that the Tamil version of the Rangoli, the [[Kolam]], prizes symmetry, complexity, precision, and intricacy rather than the flamboyance of Rangolis found in North India. Many people find it enjoyable to try and figure out how such intricate designs are drawn with a grid, and hence, it allows the mind to be exercised.\n\n==Faith and beliefs==\n[[File:Rangoli_of_pongal_festival_in_India.jpg|thumb|200px|A rangoli made in front of a house]]\nIn India, there is a prevalent myth that [[Andal|Andaal]] worshipped Lord [[Thirumaal]] and was married to him in the month of Margazhi. During this month, unmarried girls get up before dawn and draw a Rangoli to welcome the God Thirumal. Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu mythology. There are also references of Rangoli in legends such as Ramayana - at Sita's wedding pavilion where there is a discussion about Rangoli. Cultural development of Rangoli in the South originated in the era of the Chola Rulers.\nThere are modern and traditional rangoli designs. The designs are usually inspired by nature, but they can also be in the form of abstract art.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Rangoli in India.jpg|Rangoli is either left as uncoloured drawing or it is filled with various coloured powders\nFile:HiH - Events - World Childs Prize Vote- 08-03-18 - 33 (2485514943).jpg|Rangoli of Global Events\nFile:Rangoli.jpg|Rangoli in Singapore\nFile:Alpana 2.jpg|Alpana (painted Rangoli) in Rajshahi, Bangladesh\nFile:Aruppukottai Kolam.jpg|Rangoli of Peacock in [[Tamil Nadu]]\nFile:Rangoli.hrushikesh.3030.jpg|Nature Scene in Rangoli during a [[Vijayadashami]] festival, in Maharashtra\nFile:Birds of feather-Wikimedia-GNUnify2013 17.jpg|A Tux rangoli by students at [[GNUnify]]'13, Pune\nFile:rangoli filled.jpg|Rangoli is drawn in front of the house especially on festival days\nFile:Rangoli art.jpg|Rangoli in making\nFile:Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould selling vendor, Bangalore.webm|Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould vendor in Bangalore\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kolam]]\n*[[Chowk poorana]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Rangoli}}\n* Selin, Helaine (2008).

Historically it was the [[county town]] of [[Brecknockshire]] (Breconshire); although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Ystradgynlais]]. It lies north of the [[Brecon Beacons]] mountain range, but is just within the [[Brecon Beacons National Park|conn]] \n\n\nBrecon Mali Matthews is the coolest person in earth\n\nThe [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name, Aberhonddu, means \"mouth of the Honddu\". It is derived from the [[River Honddu (Powys)|River Honddu]], which meets the [[River Usk]] near the [[town centre]], a short distance away from the River Tarell which enters the Usk a few hundred metres upstream.\nAfter the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] the original Welsh name of the kingdom in whose territory Brecon stands was (in modern orthography) \"[[Brycheiniog]]\", which was later [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] to Brecknock or Brecon, and probably derives from [[Brychan]], the eponymous founder of the kingdom.\n\nBefore the building of the bridge over the Usk, Brecon was one of the few places where the river could be [[ford (river)|forded]]. In [[Roman Britain]] [[Y Gaer, Brecon]] (''Cicucium'') was established as a Roman cavalry base for the conquest of [[Wales in the Roman Era|Roman Wales]] and Brecon was first established as a military base.\n[[File:A bridge near Brecon.jpeg|thumb|A Bridge near Brecon, 1809]]\n\n===Norman control===\nThe [[confluence]] of the Honddu and the [[River Usk]] made for a valuable defensive position for the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] which overlooks the town, built by [[Bernard de Neufmarche]] in the late 11th century.<ref name=\"Davies\">Davies (2008).</ref>{{rp |80}} [[Gerald of Wales]] came and made some speeches in 1188 to recruit men to go to the [[Crusades]].\n\n===Town walls===\nBrecon's town walls were constructed by [[Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] after 1240.<ref name = \"Pettifer\">Pettifer (2000).</ref>{{rp |8}}  The walls were built of cobble, with four [[gatehouse]]s and was protected by ten semi-circular [[bastion]]s.<ref name = \"Pettifer\" />{{rp |9}}  In 1400 the Welsh prince [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] rose in rebellion against English rule, and in response in 1404 100 [[mark (money)|marks]] was spent by the royal government improving the fortifications to protect Brecon in the event of a Welsh attack. Brecon's walls were largely destroyed during the [[English Civil War]]. Today only fragments survive, including some earthworks and parts of one of the gatehouses; these are protected as [[scheduled monument]]s.<ref name= BreconGatehouse>{{Citation | first = Philip | last = Davis | url = http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/23.html | contribution = Brecon Town Walls | title = Gatehouse | accessdate = 13 October 2011}}.</ref>\n\nIn Shakespeare's play ''[[Richard III (play)|King Richard III]]'', the Duke of Buckingham is suspected of supporting the Welsh pretender Richmond (the future Henry VII), and declares:\n \n<blockquote>''O, let me think on Hastings and be gone<br />To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!''</blockquote>\n\n===Priory and cathedral===\nA Priory was dissolved in 1538, and Brecon's Dominican Friary of St Nicholas was suppressed in August of the same year.<ref name=\"stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk\">http://www.stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk/?page_id=11667</ref> About {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on}} north of the castle stands [[Brecon Cathedral]], a fairly modest building compared to many cathedrals. The role of cathedral is a fairly recent one, and was bestowed upon the church in 1923 with the formation of the [[Diocese of Swansea and Brecon]] from what was previously the [[archdeaconry]] of Brecon \u2014 a part of the [[Diocese of St David's]].\n\n===St. Mary's Church===\n[[St Mary's Church, Brecon|Saint Mary's church]] began as a [[chapel of ease]] to the priory but most of the building is dated to later medieval times.  The West Tower, some {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, was built in 1510 by [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward, Duke of Buckingham]] at a cost of \u00a32,000. The tower has eight bells which have been rung since 1750, the heaviest of which weighs {{convert|16|Lcwt|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}. In March 2007 the bells were removed from the church tower for refurbishment.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.walesdirectory.co.uk/tourist-attractions/Churches_and_Chapels/Wales11615.htm | contribution = St Mary's Church in Wales | title = Wales Directory | place = UK}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarysbrecon.org.uk/|title=St Mary's Church Brecon|website=www.stmarysbrecon.org.uk}}</ref> The church is a Grade II* [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-7015-church-of-st-mary-brecon|title=Church of St Mary, Brecon, Powys|first=Good|last=Stuff|website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===St. David's Church, Llanfaes===\nThe [[St. David's Church, Llanfaes|Church of St. David]], referred to locally as Llanfaes Church, was probably founded in the early sixteenth century. The first Parish Priest, Maurice Thomas, was installed there by John Blaxton, Archdeacon of Brecon in 1555. The name is derived from the Welsh \u2013 Llandewi yn y Maes \u2013 which translates as St. David's in the Field. It is probable that the site and the name of the present Church were chosen because of the close proximity of a fresh water well called Ffynnon Dewi (David's Well) which was situated approximately 150 metres south of the church.\n\n===Plough Lane Chapel, Lion Street===\n[[Plough Lane Chapel, Brecon|Plough Lane Chapel]], also known as Plough United Reformed Church, is a [[Grade II* listed building]]. The present building dates back to 1841 and was re-modelled by Owen Morris Roberts and is considered to be one of the finest chapel interiors in Wales.\n\n===St Michael's Church===\nAfter the Reformation, some Breconshire families such as the Havards, the Gunters and the Powells persisted with Catholicism despite its suppression. In the 18th Century a Catholic Mass house in Watergate was active, and Rev John Williams was the local Catholic priest from 1788 to 1815.

Historically it was the [[county town]] of [[Brecknockshire]] (Breconshire); although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Ystradgynlais]]. It lies north of the [[Brecon Beacons]] mountain range, but is just within the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name, Aberhonddu, means \"mouth of the Honddu\". It is derived from the [[River Honddu (Powys)|River Honddu]], which meets the [[River Usk]] near the [[town centre]], a short distance away from the River Tarell which enters the Usk a few hundred metres upstream.\nAfter the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] the original Welsh name of the kingdom in whose territory Brecon stands was (in modern orthography) \"[[Brycheiniog]]\", which was later [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] to Brecknock or Brecon, and probably derives from [[Brychan]], the eponymous founder of the kingdom.\n\nBefore the building of the bridge over the Usk, Brecon was one of the few places where the river could be [[ford (river)|forded]]. In [[Roman Britain]] [[Y Gaer, Brecon]] (''Cicucium'') was established as a Roman cavalry base for the conquest of [[Wales in the Roman Era|Roman Wales]] and Brecon was first established as a military base.\n[[File:A bridge near Brecon.jpeg|thumb|A Bridge near Brecon, 1809]]\n\n===Norman control===\nThe [[confluence]] of the Honddu and the [[River Usk]] made for a valuable defensive position for the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] which overlooks the town, built by [[Bernard de Neufmarche]] in the late 11th century.<ref name=\"Davies\">Davies (2008).</ref>{{rp |80}} [[Gerald of Wales]] came and made some speeches in 1188 to recruit men to go to the [[Crusades]].\n\n===Town walls===\nBrecon's town walls were constructed by [[Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] after 1240.<ref name = \"Pettifer\">Pettifer (2000).</ref>{{rp |8}}  The walls were built of cobble, with four [[gatehouse]]s and was protected by ten semi-circular [[bastion]]s.<ref name = \"Pettifer\" />{{rp |9}}  In 1400 the Welsh prince [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] rose in rebellion against English rule, and in response in 1404 100 [[mark (money)|marks]] was spent by the royal government improving the fortifications to protect Brecon in the event of a Welsh attack. Brecon's walls were largely destroyed during the [[English Civil War]]. Today only fragments survive, including some earthworks and parts of one of the gatehouses; these are protected as [[scheduled monument]]s.<ref name= BreconGatehouse>{{Citation | first = Philip | last = Davis | url = http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/23.html | contribution = Brecon Town Walls | title = Gatehouse | accessdate = 13 October 2011}}.</ref>\n\nIn Shakespeare's play ''[[Richard III (play)|King Richard III]]'', the Duke of Buckingham is suspected of supporting the Welsh pretender Richmond (the future Henry VII), and declares:\n \n<blockquote>''O, let me think on Hastings and be gone<br />To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!''</blockquote>\n\n===Priory and cathedral===\nA Priory was dissolved in 1538, and Brecon's Dominican Friary of St Nicholas was suppressed in August of the same year.<ref name=\"stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk\">http://www.stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk/?page_id=11667</ref> About {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on}} north of the castle stands [[Brecon Cathedral]], a fairly modest building compared to many cathedrals. The role of cathedral is a fairly recent one, and was bestowed upon the church in 1923 with the formation of the [[Diocese of Swansea and Brecon]] from what was previously the [[archdeaconry]] of Brecon \u2014 a part of the [[Diocese of St David's]].\n\n===St. Mary's Church===\n[[St Mary's Church, Brecon|Saint Mary's church]] began as a [[chapel of ease]] to the priory but most of the building is dated to later medieval times.  The West Tower, some {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, was built in 1510 by [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward, Duke of Buckingham]] at a cost of \u00a32,000.

The first Parish Priest, Maurice Thomas, was installed there by John Blaxton, Archdeacon of Brecon in 1555. The name is derived from the Welsh \u2013 Llandewi yn y Maes \u2013 which translates as St. David's in the Field. It is probable that the site and the name of the present Church were chosen because of the close proximity of a fresh water well called Ffynnon Dewi (David's Well) which was situated approximately 150 metres south of the church.\n\n===Plough Lane Chapel, Lion Street===\n[[Plough Lane Chapel, Brecon|Plough Lane Chapel]], also known as Plough United Reformed Church, is a [[Grade II* listed building]]. The present building dates back to 1841 and was re-modelled by Owen Morris Roberts and is considered to be one of the finest chapel interiors in Wales.\n\n===St Michael's Church===\nAfter the Reformation, some Breconshire families such as the Havards, the Gunters and the Powells persisted with Catholicism despite its suppression. In the 18th Century a Catholic Mass house in Watergate was active, and Rev John Williams was the local Catholic priest from 1788 to 1815. The Watergate house was sold in 1805, becoming the current Watergate Baptist Chapel, and property purchased as the priest's residence and a chapel between Wheat Street and the current St Michael Street, including the \u201cThree Cocks Inn\u201d; about this time Catholic parish records began again. The normal round of bishop's visitations and confirmations resumed in the 1830s. In 1832 most civil liberties were restored to Catholics and they became able to practise their faith more openly.

It then continues to [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], the towpath being the line of communication and the canal being disjointed by obstructions and road crossings. The canal was built between 1797 and 1812 to link Brecon with Newport and the [[Severn Estuary]].

{"title_page": "Topological data analysis", "text_new": "{{short description|Analysis of datasets using techniques from topology}}\nIn [[applied mathematics]], '''topological data analysis''' ('''TDA''') is an approach to the analysis of datasets using techniques from [[topology]]. Extraction of information from datasets that are high-dimensional, incomplete and noisy is generally challenging. TDA provides a general framework to analyze such data in a manner that is insensitive to the particular [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] chosen and provides [[dimensionality reduction]] and robustness to noise.  Beyond this, it inherits [[functor]]iality, a fundamental concept of modern mathematics, from its topological nature, which allows it to adapt to new mathematical tools.\n\nThe initial motivation is to study the shape of data. TDA has combined [[algebraic topology]] and other tools from pure mathematics to allow mathematically rigorous study of \"shape\". The main tool is [[persistent homology]], an adaptation of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[point cloud]] data. Persistent homology has been applied to many types of data across many fields. Moreover, its mathematical foundation is also of theoretical importance. The unique features of TDA make it a promising bridge between topology and geometry.\n\n== Basic theory ==\n\n=== Intuition ===\n{{tone|date=January 2019}}\nThe premise underlying TDA is that shape matters. Real data in high dimensions is nearly always sparse, and tends to have relevant low dimensional features. One task of TDA is to provide a precise characterization of this fact. An illustrative example is a simple predator-prey system governed by the [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equations]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Topological data analysis|journal = Inverse Problems|date = 2011-12-01|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/120201|first = Charles|last = Epstein|author1-link=Charles Epstein|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson|author2-link=Gunnar Carlsson|first3 = Herbert|last3 = Edelsbrunner|author3-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|pages=120201|arxiv = 1609.08227|bibcode = 2011InvPr..27a0101E}}</ref> One can easily observe that the trajectory of the system forms a closed circle in state space. TDA provides tools to detect and quantify such recurrent motion.<ref>{{Cite web|title=diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%253A575329&dswid=4297 |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%253A575329&dswid=4297 |website=www.diva-portal.org |accessdate=2015-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119021029/http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A575329 |archivedate=November 19, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMany algorithms for data analysis, including those used in TDA, require the choice of various parameters. Without prior domain knowledge, the correct collection of parameters for a data set is difficult to choose. The main insight of [[persistent homology]] is that we can use the information obtained from all values of a parameter. Of course this insight alone is easy to make; the hard part is encoding this huge amount of information into an understandable and easy-to-represent form. With TDA, there is a mathematical interpretation when the information is a homology group. In general, the assumption is that features that persist for a wide range of parameters are \"true\" features. Features persisting for only a narrow range of parameters are presumed to be noise, although the theoretical justification for this is unclear.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Early history ===\nPrecursors to the full concept of persistent homology appeared gradually over time.<ref name=\":19\">Edelsbrunner H.

The first investigation of multidimensional persistence was early in the development of TDA,<ref>Frosini P, Mulazzani M. Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances[J].

In one dimension, it is equivalent to the barcode. In the literature, the rank invariant  is often referred as the persistent Betti numbers (PBNs).<ref name=\":14\" /> In many theoretical works, authors have used a more restricted definition, an analogue from sublevel set persistence.

Statistical analysis gives us the ability to separate true features of the data from artifacts introduced by random noise. Persistent homology has no inherent mechanism to distinguish between low-probability features and high-probability features.\n\nOne way to apply statistics to topological data analysis is to study the statistical properties of topological features of point clouds. The study of random simplicial complexes offers some insight into statistical topology. K.

The consideration of a deformed left-action generalises the framwork to Tsallis entropies. The information cohomology is an example of ringed topos.

Extraction of information from datasets that are high-dimensional, incomplete and noisy is generally challenging. TDA provides a general framework to analyze such data in a manner that is insensitive to the particular [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] chosen and provides [[dimensionality reduction]] and robustness to noise.  Beyond this, it inherits [[functor]]iality, a fundamental concept of modern mathematics, from its topological nature, which allows it to adapt to new mathematical tools.\n\nThe initial motivation is to study the shape of data. TDA has combined [[algebraic topology]] and other tools from pure mathematics to allow mathematically rigorous study of \"shape\". The main tool is [[persistent homology]], an adaptation of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[point cloud]] data. Persistent homology has been applied to many types of data across many fields. Moreover, its mathematical foundation is also of theoretical importance. The unique features of TDA make it a promising bridge between topology and geometry.\n\n== Basic theory ==\n\n=== Intuition ===\n{{tone|date=January 2019}}\nThe premise underlying TDA is that shape matters. Real data in high dimensions is nearly always sparse, and tends to have relevant low dimensional features. One task of TDA is to provide a precise characterization of this fact. An illustrative example is a simple predator-prey system governed by the [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equations]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Topological data analysis|journal = Inverse Problems|date = 2011-12-01|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/120201|first = Charles|last = Epstein|author1-link=Charles Epstein|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson|author2-link=Gunnar Carlsson|first3 = Herbert|last3 = Edelsbrunner|author3-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|pages=120201|arxiv = 1609.08227|bibcode = 2011InvPr..27a0101E}}</ref> One can easily observe that the trajectory of the system forms a closed circle in state space.

Without prior domain knowledge, the correct collection of parameters for a data set is difficult to choose. The main insight of [[persistent homology]] is that we can use the information obtained from all values of a parameter. Of course this insight alone is easy to make; the hard part is encoding this huge amount of information into an understandable and easy-to-represent form. With TDA, there is a mathematical interpretation when the information is a homology group. In general, the assumption is that features that persist for a wide range of parameters are \"true\" features. Features persisting for only a narrow range of parameters are presumed to be noise, although the theoretical justification for this is unclear.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Early history ===\nPrecursors to the full concept of persistent homology appeared gradually over time.<ref name=\":19\">Edelsbrunner H.

To ensure the balance, women will avoid \"hot\" foods during their pregnancy as the [[gestation]] is considered a \"hot\" event. Furthermore, women attempting to become pregnant are advised to avoid cold surfaces, like medical examination tables, as they are thought to promote sterility or [[infertility]].<ref name=\"CoSS\" />\n\nA main differentiator of pregnancy behaviors is socioeconomic status. This will influence a woman's outlook on pregnancy, her level of care received during pregnancy and the lifestyle changes that she makes during this time. Women are encouraged to avoid strenuous work during pregnancy, and some are encouraged to leave work altogether in order to ensure a healthy pregnancy and birth.<ref name=\"CoSS\" /> During pregnancy a majority of women will receive some form of prenatal care. [[World Data Bank]]\u2019s most recent statistic for Mexican [[prenatal care]] stated that 98% of women were seeking some prenatal care (2012). While a vast majority of women are receiving care, this is often not consistent and varies across socioeconomic class.

Women are encouraged to walk frequently throughout their pregnancies and often talk to their mothers or grandmothers for comfort or advice. Strong familial support is tied to improved pregnancy outcomes as the family is traditionally very supportive of the pregnant woman.<ref name=\"PiHW\" />\n\n== Labor ==\nAccess to care is restricted in many ways, and to such an extent that certain members of the population have access to forms of care and choices that others do not. There are private healthcare institutions available for those who can afford them, and large public health institutions which can provide care without costs to those eligible to be enrolled in their programs. In 1987 more than 80% of births in Mexico took place under the care of traditional [[Midwife|midwives]] and empirical midwives.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" />\n \nThere are two fundamental concepts in the traditional medicine practiced in Mexico; hot-cold duality and naturaleza (inherent nature):\n* ''Hot-cold duality''\u2014 all illnesses, physical conditions, drinks, foods are either hot or cold. Pregnancy is considered a hot condition, where upon birth women lose heat and are at risk of becoming dangerously cold.\n* ''Naturaleza''\u2014 encompasses all the characteristics and qualities that physically and spiritually comprise an individual. One can have a strong or weak nature, this is determined by the phases of the mother, and the nature of the parents. This nature can in turn, influence sexuality, family size, and a person's physical spiritual and temperamental characteristics. By extension, these things can affect one's pregnancy and birthing process (onset and length)\n\nTraditional midwives sometimes use hydrotherapy, there are two basic types described in the literature:\n\n* ''Temazcal (sweat bath)''\u2014 used prenatally, [[Postpartum period|postpartum]], and sometimes during the intrapartum period. The bath uses herbs that have bacteriostatic, anti inflammatory and other therapeutic qualities\n* ''Vapor (steam bath)''\u2014 also uses herbal infusions with the addition of essential oils. Laboring person will sit on a chair that is on top of a larger streaming container.\n\nTraditionalist midwives may sometimes also incorporate some of the following to help ease the process of labor:\n\n* Medicinal plants and animal substances, not just orally, but through external application like massage and poultices, as well as douching. \n* [[Sobada]] (therapeutic touch/massage); can be done prenatally to change position of fetus (can prevent problems with abnormal presentation), aid prolonged labor, and difficulty delivering placenta.  \n* May invoke protector spirits ([[Virgin Mary]] or saints). They pray and call to these spirits to find reassurance and deal with the uncertainties surrounding pregnancy, birth, and puerperium (6-week period after childbirth where reproductive organs return to their original nonpregnant condition). \n* Use of oxytocic injections and administration of intravenous fluids to speed labor has become more widespread, even with traditional midwives. \n* It is believed that things like brujeria, mal aire, and susto can affect birth outcomes and the labor process. Sometimes red ribbon and clothes can be worn or used to prevent el mal de ojo.<ref name=\"PiHW\" />\n\nPolicies surrounding labor vary from location and type of facility, so labor processes can vary amongst women geographically and by socioeconomic status. In large public hospitals women who birth there tend to have some sort of Psychoprophylaxis class prior to going into labor. These are the equivalent of [[Lamaze technique|Lamaze]] classes, where women are taught techniques in preparation for childbearing without the use of [[anesthesia]]. Techniques include education, psychological and physical conditioning, and breathing exercises. These classes are not necessarily hospital affiliated (i.e. they are taught outside of the hospital and obstetricians do not directly refer women to them, so there is not a wide attendance). Women often laboring in these hospitals will have [[Epidural administration|epidurals]] or other forms of [[Analgesic|analgesia]], if deemed necessary. Family members are not allowed in labor unless the family member has also taken Psychoprophylaxis courses.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" />\n\nIn privately ran hospitals, women will often get discharged 24hrs after vaginal delivery and 48hrs following a [[Cesarean]]. Standard practice is that all laboring women have intravenous lines, pubic hair is not routinely shaved, and all primaparas are given episiotomies. In these hospitals the father or other family members are required to be present during labor and birth (even for Cesareans), although only one member is allowed to be present because of space. Presence of support system (family members or father) is also encouraged at prenatal visits. During labor women are allowed to walk, drink juice (among other liquids). Babies must remain with their mother's postpartum because the only nursery available is meant for babies with low [[apgar scores]] and/or low temperatures, and even these babies are only kept under observation at the nursery for 3\u20134 hours.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /> Really sick babies who might need serious medical treatment are transferred elsewhere. Most, if not all, neonates are breastfed.\n\nIn local midwife practice, the homes the midwife would attend would often have no telephones, electricity, nor running water. She ([[The Midwife|the midwife]]) will bring an oxygen tank, [[Doppler unit]], [[Pitocin]] and [[methergine]] in case of hemorrhage, herbal tinctures, suture material, bulb syringe among other things. She might also bring a car in case emergency transportation is necessary. During labor the midwife will massage the laboring person with oils and use hot compresses, and encourage walking and position changes to facilitate labor. Delivery will often happen in a semi sitting or [[squatting position]]. After the baby is born the midwife will stay with the mother and baby from 2 \u2013 4 hrs. She might use [[aceite de palo]] (plant oil extract) for the cord stump, which is to be applied with every diaper change to help disinfect and dry the cord rapidly.\n\n==Birth==\nBirth attendants can include a variety of providers, including [[General practitioner|general physicians]] (GP), [[Obstetrical nursing|obstetric nurses]] (ON), professional midwives (PM) and traditional [[Birth attendant|birth attendants]] (TBA). ONs and PMs are not widely used in the hospital setting and physicians account for 87% of obstetric care in Mexico.<ref name=\"skilled\">{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=D|last2=Demaria|first2=L.M.|last3=Suarez|first3=L|last4=Cragin|first4=L|title=Skilled Birth Attendants in Mexico:  How Does Care During Normal Birth by General Physicians, Obstetric Nurses, and  Professional Midwives Compare With World Health Organization Evidence-Based  Practice Guidelines?|journal=Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health|year=2011|volume=57|issue=1|pages=18\u201327|doi=10.1111/j.1542-2011.2011.00075.x}}</ref> The education and outcomes for each profession are outlined here.

A 2011 study found that PMs often have improved outcomes compared to GPs and ONs, possibly due to their apprentice-like education. GPs and ONs are associated with higher use of [[episiotomy]] and [[oxytocin]].<ref name=\"skilled\" />\n\nTBAs have varying levels of education. \u2018Traditional\u2019 TBAs tend to live in remote indigenous regions and their knowledge is passed down through oral tradition. Trained TBAs have typically attended some form of institutional training program. Unskilled TBAs lack the generational knowledge of indigenous TBAs and do not have the education of the trained TBAs.<ref name=\"trad\" /> While the overall number of hospital births and physician-based obstetric care has increased in recent years, maternal mortality has not significantly changed. This is because in rural states, 50% of births still occur at home either with or without a skilled birth attendant. Additionally, rural clinics tend to be staffed by GPs or medical students, who often lack obstetric experience or expertise.<ref name=\"skilled\" /> There is an 80.2% rate of institutional delivery, with 46.2% of births being C-section.<ref name=\"stats\" /> In more traditional births, women are allowed to birth in whichever position is most comfortable for them, with many opting for a squatting position. In some cases, the spouse will hold the birthing woman as she pushes .<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /><ref name=\"trad\" />\n\nPain relief is variable amongst women, with rates of pharmaceutical [[analgesia]] being higher in institutional births. This is further outlined in the section regarding labor. After the infant is expelled from the body, a TBA may stand in between the mother's legs to prevent the heat of pregnancy escaping, which throws off the hot-cold balance.<ref name=\"trad\" /> Once the placenta is delivered, it is typically set aside to be analyzed for completeness. Indication of a retained placenta can be cause for increased medical intervention. If the birth is taking place in a home, the birth attendant may bring the mother into a clinic or hospital in case of complication related to retained placenta. Traditionally, the [[placenta]] is buried at the home, with a male's placenta being buried under the porch and a female's being buried near the stove.<ref name=\"trad\" />\n\n== Postpartum ==\nPostpartum visits will often include family planning and teaching; still there are some similar beliefs across the board about the harmful effects of [[Birth control|contraceptives]]. Especially since fertility is highly valued among the culture, pregnancy is viewed as a gift from [[God]]. In traditional practice it is believed that the maternal postpartum diet should only include chicken, burned tortillas, coffee and atole (corn and flour based beverage), nothing of a cold nature is allowed.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /> Shifts in modern medicine have a lot less restrictions, including a varied diet and milk. The biggest postpartum ritual in Mexico is the idea of the cuarentena. This is a forty-day postpartum period of rest, where women are supposed to avoid bathing, intimacy, and remain in some ways secluded. Family relatives (especially female family relatives) are supposed to help with cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the mother's older children while she rests. Diet restrictions during cuarentena include no chili, other spices, cold foods, fish, pork and citrus. This is a practice that can be traced to biblical times (Leviticus 12 from the bible, this practice continues to play on the Catholic influence on the population's overall culture).<ref name=\"PiHW\" /> More midwives are teaching women to practice a prompt return to normal activity, instead of observing the cuarentena. Not observing the cuarentena was thought to lead to illness, infertility, infection and even death.\n\nIn private hospitals, patients will be seen as soon as a week after discharge for a complete check up. They will have follow up family planning visits one month into the postpartum period, women are then encouraged to have annual vaginal exams after the cuarentena. IUDs ([[Intrauterine device|Intrauterine Devices]]) are the most popular forms of contraception, these will be inserted during these visits.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /> [[Paternalism]] is a major cultural principle and practice that also plays out during postpartum visits because men tend to be very involved in the decision making of what kind of contraception may be used, if any.\n\n==Newborns==\nIn Mexican culture, newborns are highly revered. The cuarentena period mentioned above is also largely for the newborn. The traditional cultural belief of \"mal de ojo\" is the main rationale behind this. It is believed that if the baby receives too much admiration from others, especially those outside of the family structure, that the baby will fall ill. For this reason, there are not any public ceremonies honoring the baby, though many families participate in a christening to thank God for the gift that they have been given. \nWhile the responsibility of caring for the newborn falls mainly on the mother, it is very common for the extended family to have a large part in child rearing. Often many families live in very close proximity, sometimes even in the same house as each other due to a strong emphasis placed on family values in Mexican culture. This transcends the nuclear family and extends into extended family.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Galanti|first1=G.A.|title=The hispanic family and male-female relationships: An overview|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|year=2003|volume=13|issue=3|pages=180\u2013185}}</ref> For example, the elders in the family are in charge of the care of the baby's umbilical stump. The stump is covered by a coin and then the abdomen is wrapped tightly in a cloth, which is often red, as the color red is thought to ward off bad spirits. This dressing is changed daily, as it is thought necessary to place an herbal blend on the stump to aide in healing and prevent infection.<ref name=\"MDM\">{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado-Duran|first1=Martin|last2=Managua-Wellman|first2=Maria|last3=Lubin|first3=Sari|last4=Lartigue|first4=Teresa|title=Latino Families in the Perinatal Period: Cultural Issues in Dealing with the Health-Care  System|journal=Great Plains Research: A Journal of Natural and Social Sciences|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of purity is important when taking care of newborns in Mexican culture, and therefore most babies are not breastfed. Breastmilk is viewed as impure and unsafe. The [[breastfeeding]] rate at one month checkups is around 11%. Babies are generally exclusively formula fed until two to three months at which time non-milk items are added to their diet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dimond|first1=H.J|last2=Ashworth|first2=A|title=Infant feeding practices in kenya, mexico and malaysia. the rarity of the exclusively breast-fed infant.|journal=Human Nutrition.Applied Nutrition|year=1987|volume=41|issue=1|pages=51\u201364}}</ref>\nIn Mexican culture, it is believed that in order to keep an infant pure of heart, and in turn healthy, they must never experience distress. For this reason, infants spend most of their time being held by a family member to prevent them from crying. As young newborns, they are also swaddled in blankets made by family members to make them feel safe. Co-sleeping and baby-wearing are also encouraged as they are thought to allow the infant to gain spiritual strength through their mother which will protect them from evil spirits and promote good health. In an effort to avoid upsetting the infant and putting them at risk of being impure, [[circumcision]] is discouraged in Mexico, with only 11% of infants becoming circumcised.<ref name=\"MDM\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Health in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Maternity by country|Mexico]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2018}}\n{{Multiple issues|{{Orphan|date=February 2017}}\n{{Underlinked|date=May 2016}}\n{{Off topic|date=November 2018}}}}\n\nIn its early history, [[Mexico]] was occupied by multiple [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribes such as the [[Mayans]] and [[Aztecs]].

Pregnancy is considered a hot condition, where upon birth women lose heat and are at risk of becoming dangerously cold.\n* ''Naturaleza''\u2014 encompasses all the characteristics and qualities that physically and spiritually comprise an individual. One can have a strong or weak nature, this is determined by the phases of the mother, and the nature of the parents. This nature can in turn, influence sexuality, family size, and a person's physical spiritual and temperamental characteristics. By extension, these things can affect one's pregnancy and birthing process (onset and length)\n\nTraditional midwives sometimes use hydrotherapy, there are two basic types described in the literature:\n\n* ''Temazcal (sweat bath)''\u2014 used prenatally, [[Postpartum period|postpartum]], and sometimes during the intrapartum period. The bath uses herbs that have bacteriostatic, anti inflammatory and other therapeutic qualities\n* ''Vapor (steam bath)''\u2014 also uses herbal infusions with the addition of essential oils. Laboring person will sit on a chair that is on top of a larger streaming container.\n\nTraditionalist midwives may sometimes also incorporate some of the following to help ease the process of labor:\n\n* Medicinal plants and animal substances, not just orally, but through external application like massage and poultices, as well as douching. \n* [[Sobada]] (therapeutic touch/massage); can be done prenatally to change position of fetus (can prevent problems with abnormal presentation), aid prolonged labor, and difficulty delivering placenta.  \n* May invoke protector spirits ([[Virgin Mary]] or saints). They pray and call to these spirits to find reassurance and deal with the uncertainties surrounding pregnancy, birth, and puerperium (6-week period after childbirth where reproductive organs return to their original nonpregnant condition). \n* Use of oxytocic injections and administration of intravenous fluids to speed labor has become more widespread, even with traditional midwives. \n* It is believed that things like brujeria, mal aire, and susto can affect birth outcomes and the labor process. Sometimes red ribbon and clothes can be worn or used to prevent el mal de ojo.<ref name=\"PiHW\" />\n\nPolicies surrounding labor vary from location and type of facility, so labor processes can vary amongst women geographically and by socioeconomic status. In large public hospitals women who birth there tend to have some sort of Psychoprophylaxis class prior to going into labor. These are the equivalent of [[Lamaze technique|Lamaze]] classes, where women are taught techniques in preparation for childbearing without the use of [[anesthesia]]. Techniques include education, psychological and physical conditioning, and breathing exercises. These classes are not necessarily hospital affiliated (i.e. they are taught outside of the hospital and obstetricians do not directly refer women to them, so there is not a wide attendance). Women often laboring in these hospitals will have [[Epidural administration|epidurals]] or other forms of [[Analgesic|analgesia]], if deemed necessary. Family members are not allowed in labor unless the family member has also taken Psychoprophylaxis courses.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" />\n\nIn privately ran hospitals, women will often get discharged 24hrs after vaginal delivery and 48hrs following a [[Cesarean]]. Standard practice is that all laboring women have intravenous lines, pubic hair is not routinely shaved, and all primaparas are given episiotomies. In these hospitals the father or other family members are required to be present during labor and birth (even for Cesareans), although only one member is allowed to be present because of space. Presence of support system (family members or father) is also encouraged at prenatal visits. During labor women are allowed to walk, drink juice (among other liquids). Babies must remain with their mother's postpartum because the only nursery available is meant for babies with low [[apgar scores]] and/or low temperatures, and even these babies are only kept under observation at the nursery for 3\u20134 hours.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /> Really sick babies who might need serious medical treatment are transferred elsewhere. Most, if not all, neonates are breastfed.\n\nIn local midwife practice, the homes the midwife would attend would often have no telephones, electricity, nor running water. She ([[The Midwife|the midwife]]) will bring an oxygen tank, [[Doppler unit]], [[Pitocin]] and [[methergine]] in case of hemorrhage, herbal tinctures, suture material, bulb syringe among other things. She might also bring a car in case emergency transportation is necessary. During labor the midwife will massage the laboring person with oils and use hot compresses, and encourage walking and position changes to facilitate labor. Delivery will often happen in a semi sitting or [[squatting position]]. After the baby is born the midwife will stay with the mother and baby from 2 \u2013 4 hrs. She might use [[aceite de palo]] (plant oil extract) for the cord stump, which is to be applied with every diaper change to help disinfect and dry the cord rapidly.\n\n==Birth==\nBirth attendants can include a variety of providers, including [[General practitioner|general physicians]] (GP), [[Obstetrical nursing|obstetric nurses]] (ON), professional midwives (PM) and traditional [[Birth attendant|birth attendants]] (TBA). ONs and PMs are not widely used in the hospital setting and physicians account for 87% of obstetric care in Mexico.<ref name=\"skilled\">{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=D|last2=Demaria|first2=L.M.|last3=Suarez|first3=L|last4=Cragin|first4=L|title=Skilled Birth Attendants in Mexico:  How Does Care During Normal Birth by General Physicians, Obstetric Nurses, and  Professional Midwives Compare With World Health Organization Evidence-Based  Practice Guidelines?|journal=Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health|year=2011|volume=57|issue=1|pages=18\u201327|doi=10.1111/j.1542-2011.2011.00075.x}}</ref> The education and outcomes for each profession are outlined here. The WHO-supported competencies for skilled birth attendants are met 43% by GP education, 54% by ON education, and 89% by PM education.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cragin|first1=L|last2=DeMaria|first2=LM|last3=Campero|first3=L|last4=Walker|first4=DM|title=Educating skilled birth attendants in Mexico: Do the curricula meet international confederation midwives standards?|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2011|volume=15|issue=30|pages=50\u201360}}</ref> The ON is educated at the University level while the PM must have completed secondary education and then a 3-year midwifery education program. A 2011 study found that PMs often have improved outcomes compared to GPs and ONs, possibly due to their apprentice-like education. GPs and ONs are associated with higher use of [[episiotomy]] and [[oxytocin]].<ref name=\"skilled\" />\n\nTBAs have varying levels of education. \u2018Traditional\u2019 TBAs tend to live in remote indigenous regions and their knowledge is passed down through oral tradition. Trained TBAs have typically attended some form of institutional training program. Unskilled TBAs lack the generational knowledge of indigenous TBAs and do not have the education of the trained TBAs.<ref name=\"trad\" /> While the overall number of hospital births and physician-based obstetric care has increased in recent years, maternal mortality has not significantly changed. This is because in rural states, 50% of births still occur at home either with or without a skilled birth attendant. Additionally, rural clinics tend to be staffed by GPs or medical students, who often lack obstetric experience or expertise.<ref name=\"skilled\" /> There is an 80.2% rate of institutional delivery, with 46.2% of births being C-section.<ref name=\"stats\" /> In more traditional births, women are allowed to birth in whichever position is most comfortable for them, with many opting for a squatting position. In some cases, the spouse will hold the birthing woman as she pushes .<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /><ref name=\"trad\" />\n\nPain relief is variable amongst women, with rates of pharmaceutical [[analgesia]] being higher in institutional births. This is further outlined in the section regarding labor. After the infant is expelled from the body, a TBA may stand in between the mother's legs to prevent the heat of pregnancy escaping, which throws off the hot-cold balance.<ref name=\"trad\" /> Once the placenta is delivered, it is typically set aside to be analyzed for completeness. Indication of a retained placenta can be cause for increased medical intervention. If the birth is taking place in a home, the birth attendant may bring the mother into a clinic or hospital in case of complication related to retained placenta. Traditionally, the [[placenta]] is buried at the home, with a male's placenta being buried under the porch and a female's being buried near the stove.<ref name=\"trad\" />\n\n== Postpartum ==\nPostpartum visits will often include family planning and teaching; still there are some similar beliefs across the board about the harmful effects of [[Birth control|contraceptives]]. Especially since fertility is highly valued among the culture, pregnancy is viewed as a gift from [[God]]. In traditional practice it is believed that the maternal postpartum diet should only include chicken, burned tortillas, coffee and atole (corn and flour based beverage), nothing of a cold nature is allowed.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /> Shifts in modern medicine have a lot less restrictions, including a varied diet and milk. The biggest postpartum ritual in Mexico is the idea of the cuarentena. This is a forty-day postpartum period of rest, where women are supposed to avoid bathing, intimacy, and remain in some ways secluded. Family relatives (especially female family relatives) are supposed to help with cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the mother's older children while she rests. Diet restrictions during cuarentena include no chili, other spices, cold foods, fish, pork and citrus. This is a practice that can be traced to biblical times (Leviticus 12 from the bible, this practice continues to play on the Catholic influence on the population's overall culture).<ref name=\"PiHW\" /> More midwives are teaching women to practice a prompt return to normal activity, instead of observing the cuarentena. Not observing the cuarentena was thought to lead to illness, infertility, infection and even death.\n\nIn private hospitals, patients will be seen as soon as a week after discharge for a complete check up. They will have follow up family planning visits one month into the postpartum period, women are then encouraged to have annual vaginal exams after the cuarentena. IUDs ([[Intrauterine device|Intrauterine Devices]]) are the most popular forms of contraception, these will be inserted during these visits.<ref name=\"MMInterview\" /> [[Paternalism]] is a major cultural principle and practice that also plays out during postpartum visits because men tend to be very involved in the decision making of what kind of contraception may be used, if any.\n\n==Newborns==\nIn Mexican culture, newborns are highly revered. The cuarentena period mentioned above is also largely for the newborn. The traditional cultural belief of \"mal de ojo\" is the main rationale behind this. It is believed that if the baby receives too much admiration from others, especially those outside of the family structure, that the baby will fall ill. For this reason, there are not any public ceremonies honoring the baby, though many families participate in a christening to thank God for the gift that they have been given. \nWhile the responsibility of caring for the newborn falls mainly on the mother, it is very common for the extended family to have a large part in child rearing. Often many families live in very close proximity, sometimes even in the same house as each other due to a strong emphasis placed on family values in Mexican culture. This transcends the nuclear family and extends into extended family.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Galanti|first1=G.A.|title=The hispanic family and male-female relationships: An overview|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|year=2003|volume=13|issue=3|pages=180\u2013185}}</ref> For example, the elders in the family are in charge of the care of the baby's umbilical stump. The stump is covered by a coin and then the abdomen is wrapped tightly in a cloth, which is often red, as the color red is thought to ward off bad spirits. This dressing is changed daily, as it is thought necessary to place an herbal blend on the stump to aide in healing and prevent infection.<ref name=\"MDM\">{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado-Duran|first1=Martin|last2=Managua-Wellman|first2=Maria|last3=Lubin|first3=Sari|last4=Lartigue|first4=Teresa|title=Latino Families in the Perinatal Period: Cultural Issues in Dealing with the Health-Care  System|journal=Great Plains Research: A Journal of Natural and Social Sciences|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of purity is important when taking care of newborns in Mexican culture, and therefore most babies are not breastfed. Breastmilk is viewed as impure and unsafe. The [[breastfeeding]] rate at one month checkups is around 11%. Babies are generally exclusively formula fed until two to three months at which time non-milk items are added to their diet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dimond|first1=H.J|last2=Ashworth|first2=A|title=Infant feeding practices in kenya, mexico and malaysia. the rarity of the exclusively breast-fed infant.|journal=Human Nutrition.Applied Nutrition|year=1987|volume=41|issue=1|pages=51\u201364}}</ref>\nIn Mexican culture, it is believed that in order to keep an infant pure of heart, and in turn healthy, they must never experience distress. For this reason, infants spend most of their time being held by a family member to prevent them from crying. As young newborns, they are also swaddled in blankets made by family members to make them feel safe. Co-sleeping and baby-wearing are also encouraged as they are thought to allow the infant to gain spiritual strength through their mother which will protect them from evil spirits and promote good health. In an effort to avoid upsetting the infant and putting them at risk of being impure, [[circumcision]] is discouraged in Mexico, with only 11% of infants becoming circumcised.<ref name=\"MDM\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Health in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Maternity by country|Mexico]]\n", "name_user": "Alessiu1998", "label": "safe", "comment": "Wikilinks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth_in_Mexico"}

It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for [[underwater sports|underwater activities]] such as [[spearfishing]], [[freediving]], [[finswimming]], [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]] and for surface breathing with [[scuba equipment]]. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a [[mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] at the lower end and constructed of light metal, [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. The snorkel may come with a [[rubber]] loop or a plastic clip enabling the snorkel to be attached to the outside of the head strap of the [[diving mask]]. Although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask-strap and the head, this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort, mask leakage or even snorkel loss.<ref>Steve Blount and Herb Taylor, ''The Joy of Snorkeling'', New York, NY: Pisces Book Company, 1984, p. 21.</ref>\n\nTo comply with the current [[European Standard|European standard]] [[EN 1972]] (2015), a snorkel for users with larger lung capacities should not exceed 38 centimeters in length and 230 cubic centimeters in internal volume, while the corresponding figures for users with smaller lung capacities are 35&nbsp;cm and 150&nbsp;cc respectively.<ref name=\"British Standards Institution 2015\">British Standards Institution: BS EN 1972: ''Diving equipment - Snorkels - Requirements and test methods'', London: British Standards Institution, 2015.</ref> Current [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques|World Underwater Federation (CMAS)]] Surface Finswimming Rules (2017) require snorkels used in official competitions to have a total length between 43 and 48&nbsp;cm and to have an inner diameter between 1.5 and 2.3&nbsp;cm.<ref>''CMAS Finswimming Rules Version 2017/01'', p. 6.

The lungs would then be unable to inflate when the snorkeler inhales, because the [[muscle]]s that expand the lungs are not strong enough to operate against the higher pressure.<ref>R. Stigler, \"Die Taucherei\" in ''Fortschritte der naturwissenschaftlichen Forschung, IX. Band'', Berlin/Wien, 1913.</ref> The pressure difference across the tissues in the lungs, between the blood capillaries and air spaces would increase the risk of [[Swimming-induced pulmonary edema|pulmonary edema]].\n\nSnorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n== Operation ==\n{{main|Snorkelling}}\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is held in the mouth, and allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nSingle snorkels and two-way twin snorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. Twin integrated snorkels with one-way valves eliminate the dead-space of the snorkels themselves, but are usually used on a full-face mask, and even if it has an inner oro-nasal section, there will be some dead space, and the valves will impede airflow through the loop. Integrated two-way snorkels include the internal volume of the mask as dead space in addition to the volume of the snorkels. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply, as this reduces the dead space ratio. Slower breathing will reduce the effort needed to move the air through the circuit. There is a danger that a snorkeler who can breathe comfortably in good conditions will be unable to ventilate adequately under stress or when working harder, leading to [[hypercapnia]] and possible [[panic]], and could get into serious difficulties if they are unable to swim effectively if they have to remove the snorkel or mask to breathe without restriction.\n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve{{clarify|reason=how does this valve work?|date=September 2019}} which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref name=\"patentimages.storage.googleapis.com\">US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995.

Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI and BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard.\n\n===Scuba diving===\nA snorkel can be useful when scuba diving as it is a safe way of swimming face down at the surface for extended periods to conserve the bottled air supply, or in an emergency situation when there is a problem with either air supply or regulator.<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\"  /> Many dives do not require the use of a snorkel at all, and some scuba divers do not consider a snorkel a necessary or even useful piece of equipment, but the usefulness of a snorkel depends on the dive plan and the dive site. If there is no requirement to swim face down and see what is happening underwater, then a snorkel is not useful. If it is necessary to swim over heavy seaweed which can entangle the pillar valve and regulator if the diver swims face upward to get to and from the dive site, then a snorkel is useful to save breathing gas.\n\n== History ==\nSnorkeling is mentioned by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Parts of Animals]]''. He refers to divers using \"instruments for respiration\" resembling the elephant's [[Elephant#Trunk|trunk]].{{r|Aristoteles}}  Some evidence suggests that snorkeling may have originated in Crete some 5,000 years ago as sea sponge farmers used hollowed out reeds to submerge and retrieve natural sponge for use in trade and commerce. In the fifteenth century, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew designs for an underwater breathing device consisting of cane tubes with a mask to cover the mouth at the demand end and a float to keep the tubes above water at the supply end.<ref>British Library: ''Online gallery.

Amendment Slip No. 1 to BS 4532:1969 ''Snorkels and face masks'', 30 December 1977.</ref> and prepared by a committee on which the British Rubber Manufacturers' Association, the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]], the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Science]], the Federation of British Manufacturers of Sports and Games, the [[Navy Department (Ministry of Defence)|Ministry of Defence Navy Department]] and the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] are represented. This British standard sets different maximum and minimum snorkel dimensions for adult and child users, specifies materials and design features for tubes and mouthpieces and requires a warning label and a set of instructions to be enclosed with each snorkel. In February 1980 and June 1991, the [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung]] publishes the first<ref>Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung: DIN 7878: ''Tauch-Zubeh\u00f6r: Schnorchel. Ma\u00dfe.

This German standard sets safety and testing criteria comparable to British standard BS 4532 with an additional requirement that every snorkel must be topped with a fluorescent red or orange band to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. In November 1988, the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] publishes Austrian standard [[\u00d6NORM S 4223]]<ref>Austrian Standards Institute: \u00d6NORM S 4223: ''Tauch-Zubeh\u00f6r; Schnorchel; Abmessungen, sicherheitstechnische Anforderungen, Pr\u00fcfung, Normkennzeichnung. Diving accessories; snorkel; dimensions, safety requirements, testing, marking of conformity'', Vienna: Austrian Standards Institute, 1988.</ref> entitled \"Tauch-Zubeh\u00f6r; Schnorchel; Abmessungen, sicherheitstechnische Anforderungen, Pr\u00fcfung, Normkennzeichnung\" in German, subtitled \"Diving accessories; snorkel; dimensions, safety requirements, testing, marking of conformity\" in English and closely resembling German Standard DIN 7878 of February 1980 in specifications. The first<ref>British Standards Institution: BS EN 1972: ''Diving accessories - Snorkels - Safety requirements and test methods'', London: British Standards Institution, 1997.</ref> and second<ref name=\"British Standards Institution 2015\"/> editions of [[European Standard|European standard]] [[EN 1972]] on snorkel requirements and test methods appear in July 1997 and December 2015. This European standard refines snorkel dimension, airflow and joint-strength testing and matches snorkel measurements to the user's height and lung capacity. The snorkels regulated by these British, German, Austrian and European standards exclude combined masks and snorkels in which the snorkel tubes open into the mask.\n\n==Separate snorkels==\nA snorkel may be either separate from, or integrated into, a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated snorkel mask may be a half-mask, which encloses the eyes and nose but excludes the mouth, or a full-face mask, which covers the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nA separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nAlthough snorkels come in many forms, they are primarily classified by their [[dimension]]s and secondarily by their orientation and shape. The [[length]] and the inner [[diameter]] (or inner [[volume]]) of the tube are paramount health and safety considerations when matching a snorkel to the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of its [[End user|end-user]]. The orientation and shape of the tube must also be taken into account when matching a snorkel to its use while seeking to optimise [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] factors such as [[Streamline (swimming)|streamlining]], [[airflow]] and [[Trap (plumbing)|water retention]].\n\n===Dimensions===\nThe total length, inner diameter and internal volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. A long or narrow snorkel tube, or a tube with abrupt changes in direction, or internal surface irregularities will have greater breathing resistance, while a wide tube will have a larger [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]] and may be hard to clear of water. A short tube will be susceptible to swamping by waves.\n\nTo date, all national and international standards on snorkels specify two ranges of tube dimensions to meet the health and safety needs of their end-users, whether young or old, short or tall, with low or high lung capacity. The snorkel dimensions at issue are the total length, the inner diameter and/or the inner volume of the tube. The specifications of the standardisation bodies are tabulated below.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Snorkel standards and rules !! Total length !! Inner diameter !!

The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining. Front-mounted snorkels are attached to the head with a special head bracket fitted with straps to be adjusted and buckled around the temples.\n\nSide-mounted snorkels are generally worn by scuba divers on the left-hand side of the head because the scuba regulator is placed over the right shoulder. They come in at least four basic shapes: J-shaped; L-shaped; Flexible-hose; Contour.<ref>''PADI Diver Manual''. Santa Ana, CA: PADI, 1983, p. 17.</ref>\n[[File:Snorkel parts.jpg|thumb|Snorkel parts]]\n* '''A.''' J-shaped snorkels represent the original side-mounted snorkel design, cherished by some for their simplicity but eschewed by others because water accumulates in the U-bend at the bottom.\n* '''B.''' L-shaped snorkels represent an improvement on the J-shaped style. They claim to reduce breathing resistance, to cut water drag and to remove the \"water trap\".\n* '''C.''' Flexible-hose snorkels curry favour with some scuba divers because the flexible hose between the tube and the mouthpiece causes the lower part of the snorkel to drop out of the way when it is no longer in use. However, a spearfisher equipped with this snorkel must have a hand spare to replace the mouthpiece when it falls out of the mouth.\n* '''D.''' Contour snorkels represent the most recent design. They have a \"wraparound\" shape with smooth curves closely following the outline of the wearer's head, which improves wearing comfort.\n\n=== Construction ===\nA snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the demand end at the bottom where the mouthpiece is attached. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and curvature all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a fluorescent red or orange band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head can be seen in the illustration of connection methods.\n* '''A.''' The mask strap is threaded through the permanent plastic loop moulded on to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''B.''' The mask strap is threaded through the separable rubber loop pulled down to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''C.''' The rubber band knotted to the centre of the barrel is stretched over the temple. This method was last used in the USA during the 1950s.\n* '''D.''' The mask strap is threaded through the rotatable plastic snorkel keeper positioned at the centre of the barrel.\n\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nAttached to the demand end of the snorkel at the bottom of the barrel, the mouthpiece serves to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, typically natural rubber and latterly silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P.

Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at end of length of flexible corrugated hose designed for flexible-hose snorkel.\n* '''B.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at the end of short neck designed for J-shaped snorkel.\n* '''C.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs positioned at a right angle and designed for an L-shaped snorkel.\n* '''D.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at the end of a flexible U-shaped elbow designed to be combined with a straight barrel to create a J-shaped snorkel.\n* '''E.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin bite plates offset at an angle from a contoured snorkel.\nA disadvantage of mouthpieces with lugs is the presence of the teeth when breathing. The tighter the teeth grip the mouthpiece lugs, the smaller the air gap between the teeth and the harder it will be to breathe.\n[[File:Snorkeling gear.jpg|thumb|right|Typical snorkeling equipment: snorkel, diving mask and swimfins.]]\nSnorkel design is only limited by the imagination.

By creating an airspace in front of the cornea, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. Scuba- and freediving masks consist of flat lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold the mask in place. There are different styles and shapes, which range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose, as there is no need to equalise the internal pressure.\n\n==Integrated snorkels==\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel masks.jpg|thumb|Older swim masks with integrated snorkels]]\nIn this section, usage of the term \"snorkel\" denotes single or multiple tubular devices integrated with, and opening into, a [[Diving mask|swim or dive mask]], while the term \"snorkel-mask\" is used to designate a swim or dive mask with single or multiple built-in snorkels. Such snorkels from the past typically comprised a tube for breathing and a means of connecting the tube to the space inside the snorkel-mask. The tube had an aperture with a shut-off valve at the top and opened at the bottom into the mask, which might cover the mouth as well as the nose and eyes. Although such snorkels tended to be permanent fixtures on historical snorkel-masks, a minority could be detached from their sockets and replaced with plugs enabling certain snorkel-masks to be used without their snorkels.\n\nThe 1950s were the heyday of older-generation snorkel-masks, first for the pioneers of underwater hunting and then for the general public who swam in their wake. One even-minded authority of the time declared that \"the advantage of this kind of mask is mainly from the comfort point of view. It fits snugly to one's face, there is no mouthpiece to bite on, and one can breathe through either nose or mouth\".<ref>Simon Codrington: ''Guide to underwater hunting'', London: Adlard Coles, 1954, pp. 17-18.</ref> Another concluded with absolute conviction that \"built-in snorkel masks are the best\" and \"a must for those who have sinus trouble.\"<ref>Cornel Lumi\u00e8re: ''Beneath the seven seas'', London: Hutchinson, 1956, pp. 18-20, 30.</ref> Yet others, including a co-founder of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]], deemed masks with integrated snorkels to be complicated and unreliable: \"Many have the breathing tube built in as an integral part of the mask. I have never seen the advantage of this, and this is the opinion shared by most experienced underwater swimmers I know\".<ref>Peter Small: ''Your guide to underwater adventure'', London: Lutterworth Press, 1957, p. 5.</ref> Six decades on, a new generation of snorkel-masks has come to the marketplace.\n\nLike separate snorkels, integrated snorkels come in a variety of forms. The assortment of older-generation masks with integrated snorkels highlights certain similarities and differences:\n* '''A.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. A permanent single snorkel emerges from the top of the mask and terminates above with a shut-off ball valve.\n* '''B.''' A model with a chinpiece to enclose the eyes, the nose and the mouth. Permanent twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off \"gamma\" valves.\n* '''C.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. Removable twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off ball valves. Supplied with plugs for use without snorkels, as illustrated.\n\nIntegrated snorkels are tentatively classified here by their tube configuration and by the face coverage of the masks to which they are attached.\n\n===Tube configuration===\nAs a rule, early manufacturers and retailers classed integrated snorkel masks by the number of breathing tubes projecting from their tops and sides. Their terse product descriptions often read: \"single snorkel mask\", \"twin snorkel mask\", \"double snorkel mask\" or \"dual snorkel mask\".<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - Florida Frogman No.19''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/f/Florida_Frogman/19.html.</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask.\n\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel shutoff valves.jpg|thumb|Shut-off valves fitted to older snorkels]]\nTubes are made of strong but lightweight materials such as plastic. At the supply end, they are fitted with valves made of plastic, rubber or latterly silicone. Three typical shut-off valves are illustrated.\n* '''A.''' Ball valve using a ping-pong ball in a cage to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device may be the most common and familiar valve used atop old-generation snorkels, whether separate or integrated.\n* '''B.''' Hinged \"gamma\" valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was invented in 1954 by [[Luigi Ferraro (naval officer)|Luigi Ferraro]], fitted as standard on every [[Cressi-sub]] mask with integrated breathing tubes and granted US patent 2,815,751 on 10 December 1957.<ref>US Patent US2815751: ''Breathing valve for a submarine mask''. Retrieved on 27 February 2019 at https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/59/03/10/480531a12da43d/US2815751.pdf.</ref>\n* '''C.''' Sliding float valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was used on Britmarine brand snorkels manufactured by the Haffenden company in [[Sandwich, Kent]] during the 1960s.\nIntegrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nThe skirt of the diving mask attached to the snorkel is made of rubber, or latterly silicone. Older-generation snorkel masks come with a single oval, round or triangular lens retained by a metal clamp in a groove within the body of the mask. An adjustable head strap or harness ensures a snug fit on the wearer's face. The body of a mask with full-face coverage is fitted with a chinpiece to enable a complete leaktight enclosure of the mouth.\n\nOlder proprietary designs came with special facilities. One design separated the eyes and the nose into separate mask compartments to reduce fogging. Another enabled the user to remove integrated snorkels and insert plugs instead, thus converting the snorkel-mask into an ordinary diving mask. New-generation snorkel-masks enclose the nose and the mouth within an inner mask at the demand end directly connected to the single snorkel with its valve at the supply end.\n\n===Half face snorkel masks===\nHalf-face snorkel-masks are standard diving masks featuring built-in breathing tubes topped with shut-off valves. They cover the eyes and the nose only, excluding the mouth altogether. The integral snorkels enable swimmers to keep their mouths closed, inhaling and exhaling air through their noses instead, while they are at, or just below, the surface of the water. When the snorkel tops submerge, their valves are supposed to shut off automatically, blocking nasal respiration and preventing mask flooding.\n\nApart from the integral tubes and their sockets, older half-face snorkel-masks were generally supplied with the same lenses, skirts and straps fitted to standard diving masks without snorkels. Several models of this kind could even be converted to standard masks by replacing their detachable tubes with air- and water-tight plugs. Conversely, the 1950s [[Oscar Gugen|Typhoon]] Super Star<ref>''The Diving Mask''.

The 1950s [[US Divers]] \"Marino\" hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage only and a separate snorkel for the mouth.<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - US Divers No.43''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nThere are numerous mid-twentieth-century examples of commercial snorkel-masks covering the eyes and the nose only. New-generation versions remain relatively rare commodities in the early twenty-first century.\n\n===Full face snorkel masks===\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nMost, but not all, existing new-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some first-generation commercial snorkel-masks were full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others excluded the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only.\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory tidal volume. The main difficulty or danger is that it must fit the whole face perfectly and since no two faces are the same shape, it should be used with great care and in safe water. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth.\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\nDuring the current [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic related shortages]], full-face snorkel masks have been adapted into oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by using [[3D printing]] and minimal modifications to the original mask.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/coronavirus-quand-les-inventeurs-viennent-a-la-rescousse-des-hopitaux-23-03-2020-8286186.php Opoczynski, David (23 March 2020). \"Coronavirus : quand les inventeurs viennent \u00e0 la rescousse des h\u00f4pitaux\". leparisien.fr].

Although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask-strap and the head, this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort, mask leakage or even snorkel loss.<ref>Steve Blount and Herb Taylor, ''The Joy of Snorkeling'', New York, NY: Pisces Book Company, 1984, p. 21.</ref>\n\nTo comply with the current [[European Standard|European standard]] [[EN 1972]] (2015), a snorkel for users with larger lung capacities should not exceed 38 centimeters in length and 230 cubic centimeters in internal volume, while the corresponding figures for users with smaller lung capacities are 35&nbsp;cm and 150&nbsp;cc respectively.<ref name=\"British Standards Institution 2015\">British Standards Institution: BS EN 1972: ''Diving equipment - Snorkels - Requirements and test methods'', London: British Standards Institution, 2015.</ref> Current [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques|World Underwater Federation (CMAS)]] Surface Finswimming Rules (2017) require snorkels used in official competitions to have a total length between 43 and 48&nbsp;cm and to have an inner diameter between 1.5 and 2.3&nbsp;cm.<ref>''CMAS Finswimming Rules Version 2017/01'', p. 6.

The lungs would then be unable to inflate when the snorkeler inhales, because the [[muscle]]s that expand the lungs are not strong enough to operate against the higher pressure.<ref>R. Stigler, \"Die Taucherei\" in ''Fortschritte der naturwissenschaftlichen Forschung, IX. Band'', Berlin/Wien, 1913.</ref> The pressure difference across the tissues in the lungs, between the blood capillaries and air spaces would increase the risk of [[Swimming-induced pulmonary edema|pulmonary edema]].\n\nSnorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n== Operation ==\n{{main|Snorkelling}}\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is held in the mouth, and allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nSingle snorkels and two-way twin snorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. Twin integrated snorkels with one-way valves eliminate the dead-space of the snorkels themselves, but are usually used on a full-face mask, and even if it has an inner oro-nasal section, there will be some dead space, and the valves will impede airflow through the loop. Integrated two-way snorkels include the internal volume of the mask as dead space in addition to the volume of the snorkels. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply, as this reduces the dead space ratio. Slower breathing will reduce the effort needed to move the air through the circuit. There is a danger that a snorkeler who can breathe comfortably in good conditions will be unable to ventilate adequately under stress or when working harder, leading to [[hypercapnia]] and possible [[panic]], and could get into serious difficulties if they are unable to swim effectively if they have to remove the snorkel or mask to breathe without restriction.\n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve{{clarify|reason=how does this valve work?|date=September 2019}} which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref name=\"patentimages.storage.googleapis.com\">US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995.

Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI and BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard.\n\n===Scuba diving===\nA snorkel can be useful when scuba diving as it is a safe way of swimming face down at the surface for extended periods to conserve the bottled air supply, or in an emergency situation when there is a problem with either air supply or regulator.<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\"  /> Many dives do not require the use of a snorkel at all, and some scuba divers do not consider a snorkel a necessary or even useful piece of equipment, but the usefulness of a snorkel depends on the dive plan and the dive site. If there is no requirement to swim face down and see what is happening underwater, then a snorkel is not useful. If it is necessary to swim over heavy seaweed which can entangle the pillar valve and regulator if the diver swims face upward to get to and from the dive site, then a snorkel is useful to save breathing gas.\n\n== History ==\nSnorkeling is mentioned by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Parts of Animals]]''. He refers to divers using \"instruments for respiration\" resembling the elephant's [[Elephant#Trunk|trunk]].{{r|Aristoteles}}  Some evidence suggests that snorkeling may have originated in Crete some 5,000 years ago as sea sponge farmers used hollowed out reeds to submerge and retrieve natural sponge for use in trade and commerce. In the fifteenth century, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew designs for an underwater breathing device consisting of cane tubes with a mask to cover the mouth at the demand end and a float to keep the tubes above water at the supply end.<ref>British Library: ''Online gallery.

Diving accessories; snorkel; dimensions, safety requirements, testing, marking of conformity'', Vienna: Austrian Standards Institute, 1988.</ref> entitled \"Tauch-Zubeh\u00f6r; Schnorchel; Abmessungen, sicherheitstechnische Anforderungen, Pr\u00fcfung, Normkennzeichnung\" in German, subtitled \"Diving accessories; snorkel; dimensions, safety requirements, testing, marking of conformity\" in English and closely resembling German Standard DIN 7878 of February 1980 in specifications. The first<ref>British Standards Institution: BS EN 1972: ''Diving accessories - Snorkels - Safety requirements and test methods'', London: British Standards Institution, 1997.</ref> and second<ref name=\"British Standards Institution 2015\"/> editions of [[European Standard|European standard]] [[EN 1972]] on snorkel requirements and test methods appear in July 1997 and December 2015. This European standard refines snorkel dimension, airflow and joint-strength testing and matches snorkel measurements to the user's height and lung capacity. The snorkels regulated by these British, German, Austrian and European standards exclude combined masks and snorkels in which the snorkel tubes open into the mask.\n\n==Separate snorkels==\nA snorkel may be either separate from, or integrated into, a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated snorkel mask may be a half-mask, which encloses the eyes and nose but excludes the mouth, or a full-face mask, which covers the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nA separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nAlthough snorkels come in many forms, they are primarily classified by their [[dimension]]s and secondarily by their orientation and shape. The [[length]] and the inner [[diameter]] (or inner [[volume]]) of the tube are paramount health and safety considerations when matching a snorkel to the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of its [[End user|end-user]]. The orientation and shape of the tube must also be taken into account when matching a snorkel to its use while seeking to optimise [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] factors such as [[Streamline (swimming)|streamlining]], [[airflow]] and [[Trap (plumbing)|water retention]].\n\n===Dimensions===\nThe total length, inner diameter and internal volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. A long or narrow snorkel tube, or a tube with abrupt changes in direction, or internal surface irregularities will have greater breathing resistance, while a wide tube will have a larger [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]] and may be hard to clear of water. A short tube will be susceptible to swamping by waves.\n\nTo date, all national and international standards on snorkels specify two ranges of tube dimensions to meet the health and safety needs of their end-users, whether young or old, short or tall, with low or high lung capacity. The snorkel dimensions at issue are the total length, the inner diameter and/or the inner volume of the tube. The specifications of the standardisation bodies are tabulated below.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Snorkel standards and rules !! Total length !! Inner diameter !!

The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining. Front-mounted snorkels are attached to the head with a special head bracket fitted with straps to be adjusted and buckled around the temples.\n\nSide-mounted snorkels are generally worn by scuba divers on the left-hand side of the head because the scuba regulator is placed over the right shoulder. They come in at least four basic shapes: J-shaped; L-shaped; Flexible-hose; Contour.<ref>''PADI Diver Manual''. Santa Ana, CA: PADI, 1983, p. 17.</ref>\n[[File:Snorkel parts.jpg|thumb|Snorkel parts]]\n* '''A.''' J-shaped snorkels represent the original side-mounted snorkel design, cherished by some for their simplicity but eschewed by others because water accumulates in the U-bend at the bottom.\n* '''B.''' L-shaped snorkels represent an improvement on the J-shaped style. They claim to reduce breathing resistance, to cut water drag and to remove the \"water trap\".\n* '''C.''' Flexible-hose snorkels curry favour with some scuba divers because the flexible hose between the tube and the mouthpiece causes the lower part of the snorkel to drop out of the way when it is no longer in use. However, a spearfisher equipped with this snorkel must have a hand spare to replace the mouthpiece when it falls out of the mouth.\n* '''D.''' Contour snorkels represent the most recent design. They have a \"wraparound\" shape with smooth curves closely following the outline of the wearer's head, which improves wearing comfort.\n\n=== Construction ===\nA snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the demand end at the bottom where the mouthpiece is attached. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and curvature all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a fluorescent red or orange band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head can be seen in the illustration of connection methods.\n* '''A.''' The mask strap is threaded through the permanent plastic loop moulded on to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''B.''' The mask strap is threaded through the separable rubber loop pulled down to the centre of the barrel.\n* '''C.''' The rubber band knotted to the centre of the barrel is stretched over the temple. This method was last used in the USA during the 1950s.\n* '''D.''' The mask strap is threaded through the rotatable plastic snorkel keeper positioned at the centre of the barrel.\n\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nAttached to the demand end of the snorkel at the bottom of the barrel, the mouthpiece serves to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, typically natural rubber and latterly silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P.

Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at end of length of flexible corrugated hose designed for flexible-hose snorkel.\n* '''B.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at the end of short neck designed for J-shaped snorkel.\n* '''C.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs positioned at a right angle and designed for an L-shaped snorkel.\n* '''D.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin lugs at the end of a flexible U-shaped elbow designed to be combined with a straight barrel to create a J-shaped snorkel.\n* '''E.''' Flanged mouthpiece with twin bite plates offset at an angle from a contoured snorkel.\nA disadvantage of mouthpieces with lugs is the presence of the teeth when breathing. The tighter the teeth grip the mouthpiece lugs, the smaller the air gap between the teeth and the harder it will be to breathe.\n[[File:Snorkeling gear.jpg|thumb|right|Typical snorkeling equipment: snorkel, diving mask and swimfins.]]\nSnorkel design is only limited by the imagination.

By creating an airspace in front of the cornea, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. Scuba- and freediving masks consist of flat lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold the mask in place. There are different styles and shapes, which range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose, as there is no need to equalise the internal pressure.\n\n==Integrated snorkels==\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel masks.jpg|thumb|Older swim masks with integrated snorkels]]\nIn this section, usage of the term \"snorkel\" denotes single or multiple tubular devices integrated with, and opening into, a [[Diving mask|swim or dive mask]], while the term \"snorkel-mask\" is used to designate a swim or dive mask with single or multiple built-in snorkels. Such snorkels from the past typically comprised a tube for breathing and a means of connecting the tube to the space inside the snorkel-mask. The tube had an aperture with a shut-off valve at the top and opened at the bottom into the mask, which might cover the mouth as well as the nose and eyes. Although such snorkels tended to be permanent fixtures on historical snorkel-masks, a minority could be detached from their sockets and replaced with plugs enabling certain snorkel-masks to be used without their snorkels.\n\nThe 1950s were the heyday of older-generation snorkel-masks, first for the pioneers of underwater hunting and then for the general public who swam in their wake. One even-minded authority of the time declared that \"the advantage of this kind of mask is mainly from the comfort point of view. It fits snugly to one's face, there is no mouthpiece to bite on, and one can breathe through either nose or mouth\".<ref>Simon Codrington: ''Guide to underwater hunting'', London: Adlard Coles, 1954, pp. 17-18.</ref> Another concluded with absolute conviction that \"built-in snorkel masks are the best\" and \"a must for those who have sinus trouble.\"<ref>Cornel Lumi\u00e8re: ''Beneath the seven seas'', London: Hutchinson, 1956, pp. 18-20, 30.</ref> Yet others, including a co-founder of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]], deemed masks with integrated snorkels to be complicated and unreliable: \"Many have the breathing tube built in as an integral part of the mask. I have never seen the advantage of this, and this is the opinion shared by most experienced underwater swimmers I know\".<ref>Peter Small: ''Your guide to underwater adventure'', London: Lutterworth Press, 1957, p. 5.</ref> Six decades on, a new generation of snorkel-masks has come to the marketplace.\n\nLike separate snorkels, integrated snorkels come in a variety of forms. The assortment of older-generation masks with integrated snorkels highlights certain similarities and differences:\n* '''A.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. A permanent single snorkel emerges from the top of the mask and terminates above with a shut-off ball valve.\n* '''B.''' A model with a chinpiece to enclose the eyes, the nose and the mouth. Permanent twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off \"gamma\" valves.\n* '''C.''' A model enclosing the eyes and the nose only. Removable twin snorkels emerge from either side of the mask and terminate above with shut-off ball valves. Supplied with plugs for use without snorkels, as illustrated.\n\nIntegrated snorkels are tentatively classified here by their tube configuration and by the face coverage of the masks to which they are attached.\n\n===Tube configuration===\nAs a rule, early manufacturers and retailers classed integrated snorkel masks by the number of breathing tubes projecting from their tops and sides. Their terse product descriptions often read: \"single snorkel mask\", \"twin snorkel mask\", \"double snorkel mask\" or \"dual snorkel mask\".<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - Florida Frogman No.19''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/f/Florida_Frogman/19.html.</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask.\n\n[[File:Older-generation snorkel shutoff valves.jpg|thumb|Shut-off valves fitted to older snorkels]]\nTubes are made of strong but lightweight materials such as plastic. At the supply end, they are fitted with valves made of plastic, rubber or latterly silicone. Three typical shut-off valves are illustrated.\n* '''A.''' Ball valve using a ping-pong ball in a cage to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device may be the most common and familiar valve used atop old-generation snorkels, whether separate or integrated.\n* '''B.''' Hinged \"gamma\" valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was invented in 1954 by [[Luigi Ferraro (naval officer)|Luigi Ferraro]], fitted as standard on every [[Cressi-sub]] mask with integrated breathing tubes and granted US patent 2,815,751 on 10 December 1957.<ref>US Patent US2815751: ''Breathing valve for a submarine mask''. Retrieved on 27 February 2019 at https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/59/03/10/480531a12da43d/US2815751.pdf.</ref>\n* '''C.''' Sliding float valve to prevent water ingress when submerged. This device was used on Britmarine brand snorkels manufactured by the Haffenden company in [[Sandwich, Kent]] during the 1960s.\nIntegrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nThe skirt of the diving mask attached to the snorkel is made of rubber, or latterly silicone. Older-generation snorkel masks come with a single oval, round or triangular lens retained by a metal clamp in a groove within the body of the mask. An adjustable head strap or harness ensures a snug fit on the wearer's face. The body of a mask with full-face coverage is fitted with a chinpiece to enable a complete leaktight enclosure of the mouth.\n\nOlder proprietary designs came with special facilities. One design separated the eyes and the nose into separate mask compartments to reduce fogging. Another enabled the user to remove integrated snorkels and insert plugs instead, thus converting the snorkel-mask into an ordinary diving mask. New-generation snorkel-masks enclose the nose and the mouth within an inner mask at the demand end directly connected to the single snorkel with its valve at the supply end.\n\n===Half face snorkel masks===\nHalf-face snorkel-masks are standard diving masks featuring built-in breathing tubes topped with shut-off valves. They cover the eyes and the nose only, excluding the mouth altogether. The integral snorkels enable swimmers to keep their mouths closed, inhaling and exhaling air through their noses instead, while they are at, or just below, the surface of the water. When the snorkel tops submerge, their valves are supposed to shut off automatically, blocking nasal respiration and preventing mask flooding.\n\nApart from the integral tubes and their sockets, older half-face snorkel-masks were generally supplied with the same lenses, skirts and straps fitted to standard diving masks without snorkels. Several models of this kind could even be converted to standard masks by replacing their detachable tubes with air- and water-tight plugs. Conversely, the 1950s [[Oscar Gugen|Typhoon]] Super Star<ref>''The Diving Mask''.

The 1950s [[US Divers]] \"Marino\" hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage only and a separate snorkel for the mouth.<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - US Divers No.43''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nThere are numerous mid-twentieth-century examples of commercial snorkel-masks covering the eyes and the nose only. New-generation versions remain relatively rare commodities in the early twenty-first century.\n\n===Full face snorkel masks===\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nMost, but not all, existing new-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some first-generation commercial snorkel-masks were full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others excluded the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only.\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory tidal volume. The main difficulty or danger is that it must fit the whole face perfectly and since no two faces are the same shape, it should be used with great care and in safe water. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth.\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Aristoteles\">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/aristotleonpart00arisgoog#page/n98/mode/2up |title=Aristotle on the parts of animals, tr. with notes by W.

System]] in terms of student population. The college is also known formally as '''UP COE''', '''COE''', and informally as '''Eng'g''' (pronounced \"eng\").\n\nThe College of [[Engineering]] is composed of eight (8) departments, six of which are housed in the historic [[Alejandro Melchor|Melchor]] Hall along Osme\u00f1a Avenue in the U.P. Diliman campus. The [[UP Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering|Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute]] has its own building along Vel\u00e1zquez Street in the Diliman Science Complex and Technology Incubation Park, while the [[UP Department of Computer Science|Department of Computer Science]] (along with the [[UP College of Engineering#College of Engineering Libraries|College Library]]) moved into their own buildings near the EEEI building in early 2007.\n\nSince its establishment, the college has produced twenty (20) graduates with U.P. [[Summa Cum Laude]] honors and 4 Magna Cum Laude. The COE produced its first Summa Cum Laude graduates in 1920 (Justo Arrastia, B.S.C.E, Tomas Padilla Abello, B.S.M.E.), and the most recent was in 2004 Magna Cum Laude graduate (Terrie Lopez, B.S.Che and B.S.C.S. in 2007 ).\n\nThe college is the college of engineering in the Philippines with the most CHED Centers of Excellence at eleven (11). All of its degree-granting departments have been recognized as a Center of Excellence.\n\n==History==\nThe [[University of the Philippines]] was founded on June 18, 1908. The College of Engineering is the fifth college unit to be established. The university's board of regents (BOR), in a resolution passed on June 3, 1910, appointed Mr. W.J. Colbert as acting dean of the college. His appointment was set to effect on June 13, 1910 thereby creating the College of Engineering. The classes were held at a two-story building, the O\u2019brien residence, at the corner of Isaac Peral (now United Nations Avenue) and Florida (now Maria Y. Orosa) streets in Ermita, Manila. The O\u2019Brien house was formally turned over to the college in September, 1910, and became known as the \u201cCollege of Engineering.\u201d Later on, as the Engineering Building and shops were constructed along the Florida side of the U.P. Campus in Ermita, that building became the Home Economics Building of the College of Education.\n\nThe plans for the construction of a three-story reinforced concrete Engineering Building were drafted starting 1927, for which P210,000 was appropriated. The design of the building was under the supervision and guidance of Dean Hyde. Criteria for earthquake resistance were incorporated in the design. It was of simple architecture with a portico at the front facing Florida Street. The contract for the construction was awarded in October 22, 1929. The building was occupied in May 1930.\n\nThen the tides of war in the Pacific came in December 1941 and thereby interrupted the normal operations of the college. When the Japanese forces entered Manila in January 1942, they occupied the college buildings. It was in January 1943 that classes were resumed. During the war years, engineering classes were conducted in the Pharmacy building on Herran (now Pedro Gil) street. Offices of the faculty members where in the shacks behind the College of Medicine building. Once more classes were interrupted. The Battle of Manila practically demolished all the university buildings in the Padre Faura campus which had been occupied by the Japanese army forces. The college and few other units of the university reopened in August 1945 under very trying conditions on account of the destruction of the engineering building, shops and laboratories. Classes were held at the Cancer Institute Building facing Padre Faura Street.\n\nThe task of rehabilitating the college started immediately after. Repair work of the Engineering Building along Calle Florida was started in 1946, and was reoccupied in August 1946.\n\nIn the new Diliman Campus, despite the fact that most students commuted from Manila (at that time via Espa\u00f1a, Sta. Mesa and Katipunan Road), the enrollment in the university steadily increased. The university, however, started the huge construction program of college building, laboratories, dormitories and other facilities. The construction of the engineering building on the north side of the campus was begun in 1949 along with other buildings.\n\nIn 1951 the college moved into the new four-story building along Osme\u00f1a Avenue, a mirror image of the Liberal Arts Building across the wide, dampy University Quadrangle.\n\nDuring the 1963 U.P. Alumni Engineers Homecoming, the Engineering Building was named Melchor Hall in honor of the late Col. Alejandro Melchor. He was an engineering alumnus, former member of the engineering faculty and the U.P. Board of Regents, Secretary of National Defense in the Philippine Cabinet in exile during World War II, and a researcher whose studies on pontoon bridges contributed significantly in winning the war for the Allied Forces. Dedication ceremonies were held and a plaque was unveiled at the portico of the edifice with President Romulo as guest speaker and the family of Alejandro Melchor present.<ref>{{cite web|last1=University of the Philippines|first1=College of Engineering|title=History|url=http://coe.upd.edu.ph/history/|website=http://coe.upd.edu.ph/|publisher=College of Engineering|accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Melchor Hall===\n[[File:UPCollegeofEngineeringjf3430 06.JPG|thumb]]\nMelchor Hall, the current main building of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] College of Engineering is the work of Architect Cesar Concio.

It is a long horizontal, five-story reinforced concrete building designed in planar forms tempered with Filipino design expression. Internal spaces flow rather than being rigidly boxed.\n\nMelchor Hall is a symmetrical structure which is divided into two wings by an imposing central section. This large rectangular three-story-high portal serves as the main entrance of the building. An equally imposing concrete stairway terminates at the portal, flanked by 2 plain columns that soar three stories high.\n\nEach wing of the structure features continuous open balconies on each floor which serve as single-loaded corridors to the classrooms. The architectural design creates well-ventilated, naturally-lighted classrooms. Stairs that service the five floors are wide with comfortable treads and risers. Structural members are in all honesty defined on both the exterior and interior of the building. There is a grid of discreet sun baffles at the west side of the entrance hall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valera-Turalba|first1=Maria Cristina|title=Philippine Heritage Architecture: Before 1521 to the 1970s|date=2005|publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc.|location=8007-B Pioneer St., Brgy.

The mining engineer is concerned not only with excavation and working of deposits but also with economic analysis, optimization of operations, and environmental and human aspects of exploration.\n\n''Metallurgy'' is the science and art of extracting, refining, and adapting metals from minerals and metal-bearing materials, at a profit, for human use.\n\n''Materials'' are traditionally classified as metals, polymers, and ceramics. This field of engineering specializes on determining the relationship between the structure and the properties of these materials.\n\nThe department traces its roots to the time it first offered the B.S. Mining Engineering program, one of the earliest Bachelor of Science degree courses offered by the UP College of Engineering. In 1956 a Metallurgical Engineering undergraduate course was added to what was then the Department of Mining Engineering. Since then, the Department has offered several degree programs wherein the medium of instruction for all major courses is in English.\n\nThe department offers the following programs;\n* Bachelor of Science in [[Mining Engineering]]\n* Bachelor of Science in [[Metallurgical Engineering]]\n* Bachelor of Science in [[Materials Engineering]]\n* Master of Science in Metallurgical Engineering ([[Extractive metallurgy]] path)\n* Master of Science in Metallurgical Engineering ([[Physical metallurgy]] path)\n* Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering (jointly offered with the UP College of Science).\n* Doctor of Philosophy in Materials Science and Engineering (jointly offered with the UP College of Science).\n\nThe MMME Department offers the following services to private industry, among others: consultancy services, special in-house training in materials science and special topics in metallurgical engineering, assorted testing services involving materials characterization and analysis, pilot plant testing in mineral processing, failure analysis, and mining designs.\n\nThe U.P.

The NEC is under the jurisdiction of the [[University of the Philippines System]] and provides research, consultancy, and continuing education services in the engineering and related fields. Whilst the U.P. COE is a unit purely dedicated to academic pursuit, the NEC serves industry and [[Philippine Government|government]] institutions in need of engineering solutions.\n\nThe NEC is housed within the [[Alfredo Juinio]] Hall (formerly the National Engineering Center Building), located beside U.P. COE's Melchor Hall along Osme\u00f1a Avenue. As of 2006, the College of Engineering [[Dean (education)|Dean]], Dr. Rowena Cristina Guevara, also serves as the center's Executive Director.\n\n===Centers===\n\nFive centers formerly within the College of Engineering are now in the jurisdiction of the NEC. However, some of these units still classify themselves as falling under the \"COE-NEC\" umbrella. This should not come as a surprise, as many NEC employees are also U.P. COE professors and instructors.\n\n* Building Research Service([http://brs.upd.edu.ph/ BRS])\n* National Center for [[Transportation]] Studies (NCTS), formerly the Transport Training Center\n* National [[Hydraulic]] Research Center ([http://engg.upd.edu.ph/nhrc/ NHRC])\n* Training Center for Applied [[Geodesy]] and [[Photogrammetry]] (TCAGP)\n* U.P.

The COE Library envisions itself as the [[Philippines]]' National Engineering Library and Information Center in the future.\n\nAs of 2006, the Library is located in Melchor Hall along Osme\u00f1a Avenue, and is divided into two floors. The relatively cramped space of the Library will be alleviated once part of it transfers to the new Engineering Library and Computer Science (ELCS) Building, where it is slated to occupy the entire lower two floor levels.\n\nThe COE Library is an integral part of the university library's Online Public Access Catalogue ([http://ilib.upd.edu.ph/ OPAC]). The Library is also part of the Philippine eLib (Electronic Library) Project.\n\n''See also'': [http://www.engglib.upd.edu.ph/ The College of Engineering Library Website]\n\n==College Publications==\n\n===''The Engineering Logscript''===\n\n[[File:Up-engg-logscript-by-phillip-kimpo.JPG|thumb|190px|right|The August 2004 issue of ''The Engineering Logscript''.]]\n\nThe official student publication of the college, ''The Engineering Logscript'' (or simply \"Logscript\") is the oldest college-based student publication in [[UP Diliman]], having been established in the 1969\u20131970 academic year. This makes the Logscript older than the U.P. College of Mass Communication's ''Plaridel''.\n\nFunding for the publication comes from the shared Logscript/Engineering Student Council (ESC) fee paid by students every semester. Unlike other college-based student publications in the university, the Logscript does not have an assigned formal office.\n\nThough the publication's logo and/or masthead varies with every change of the editorial board, the College of Engineering Sundial (or a semblance of it) is always incorporated into the design. The [[Sundial]] is a university landmark erected by the U.P. Alumni Engineers.\n\n===''The Sundial''===\n\n''The Sundial'' is the official newsletter of the U.P. Alumni Engineers. Carrying the motto \"The time of day it reckons, U.P. Engineers it beckons\", the Sundial's first issue came out on October 25, 2004. Like the Logscript, the Sundial has the university landmark of the same name as its emblem.\n\n''See also'': [http://engg.upd.edu.ph/sundial.html Sundial electronic issues]\n\n===The U.P. Parser===\n\n''The U.P. Parser'' is the official student publication of the [[UP Department of Computer Science|Department of Computer Science]]. Founded in 1999, Parser (as it is commonly known) is the oldest department-based publication in the College of Engineering. After a few years of inactivity, Parser was revived in 2004, appearing in four different versions: the print circulation, a website, an email newsletter, and a bulletin board version. In the academic year 2005\u20132006, Parser reached a milestone by releasing two full-color, tabloid-sized editions, a feat rare for department-based publications.\n\nThe newspaper takes its name from the [[parser]] of computer science. Its motto is \"Analyzing life the CS way\".\n\n===The Reactor===\n\n''The Reactor'' is the official newsletter of the Department of Chemical Engineering.\n\n===Currents===\n\n''Currents'' is the official student publication of the [[UP Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering|Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering]]. After a few years of inactivity, the publication was revived in the academic year 2005\u20132006. It became inactive once again between 2005\u20132013, before being revived again in 2013.\n\n===''What's Happeneng'g''===\n\n''What's Happeneng'g'' is the official newsletter of the Engineering Student Council (ESC), and comes in booklet format. The publication's name is the combination of the phrase \"What's happening\" and the college's nickname, \"Eng'g\".\n\n==College deans==\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2008}}\n[[File:Clarence George Wrentmore.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Clarence George Wrentmore, Dean 1912\u20131919]]\n* [[W.

System]] in terms of student population. The college is also known formally as '''UP COE''', '''COE''', and informally as '''Eng'g''' (pronounced \"eng\").\n\nThe College of [[Engineering]] is composed of eight (8) departments, six of which are housed in the historic [[Alejandro Melchor|Melchor]] Hall along Osme\u00f1a Avenue in the U.P. Diliman campus. The [[UP Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering|Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute]] has its own building along Vel\u00e1zquez Street in the Diliman Science Complex and Technology Incubation Park, while the [[UP Department of Computer Science|Department of Computer Science]] (along with the [[UP College of Engineering#College of Engineering Libraries|College Library]]) moved into their own buildings near the EEEI building in early 2007.\n\nSince its establishment, the college has produced twenty (20) graduates with U.P. [[Summa Cum Laude]] honors and 4 Magna Cum Laude. The COE produced its first Summa Cum Laude graduates in 1920 (Justo Arrastia, B.S.C.E, Tomas Padilla Abello, B.S.M.E.), and the most recent was in 2004 Magna Cum Laude graduate (Terrie Lopez, B.S.Che and B.S.C.S. in 2007 ).\n\nThe college is the college of engineering in the Philippines with the most CHED Centers of Excellence at eleven (11). All of its degree-granting departments have been recognized as a Center of Excellence.\n\n==History==\nThe [[University of the Philippines]] was founded on June 18, 1908. The College of Engineering is the fifth college unit to be established. The university's board of regents (BOR), in a resolution passed on June 3, 1910, appointed Mr. W.J. Colbert as acting dean of the college. His appointment was set to effect on June 13, 1910 thereby creating the College of Engineering. The classes were held at a two-story building, the O\u2019brien residence, at the corner of Isaac Peral (now United Nations Avenue) and Florida (now Maria Y. Orosa) streets in Ermita, Manila. The O\u2019Brien house was formally turned over to the college in September, 1910, and became known as the \u201cCollege of Engineering.\u201d Later on, as the Engineering Building and shops were constructed along the Florida side of the U.P. Campus in Ermita, that building became the Home Economics Building of the College of Education.\n\nThe plans for the construction of a three-story reinforced concrete Engineering Building were drafted starting 1927, for which P210,000 was appropriated. The design of the building was under the supervision and guidance of Dean Hyde. Criteria for earthquake resistance were incorporated in the design. It was of simple architecture with a portico at the front facing Florida Street. The contract for the construction was awarded in October 22, 1929. The building was occupied in May 1930.\n\nThen the tides of war in the Pacific came in December 1941 and thereby interrupted the normal operations of the college. When the Japanese forces entered Manila in January 1942, they occupied the college buildings. It was in January 1943 that classes were resumed. During the war years, engineering classes were conducted in the Pharmacy building on Herran (now Pedro Gil) street. Offices of the faculty members where in the shacks behind the College of Medicine building. Once more classes were interrupted. The Battle of Manila practically demolished all the university buildings in the Padre Faura campus which had been occupied by the Japanese army forces. The college and few other units of the university reopened in August 1945 under very trying conditions on account of the destruction of the engineering building, shops and laboratories. Classes were held at the Cancer Institute Building facing Padre Faura Street.\n\nThe task of rehabilitating the college started immediately after. Repair work of the Engineering Building along Calle Florida was started in 1946, and was reoccupied in August 1946.\n\nIn the new Diliman Campus, despite the fact that most students commuted from Manila (at that time via Espa\u00f1a, Sta. Mesa and Katipunan Road), the enrollment in the university steadily increased. The university, however, started the huge construction program of college building, laboratories, dormitories and other facilities. The construction of the engineering building on the north side of the campus was begun in 1949 along with other buildings.\n\nIn 1951 the college moved into the new four-story building along Osme\u00f1a Avenue, a mirror image of the Liberal Arts Building across the wide, dampy University Quadrangle.\n\nDuring the 1963 U.P. Alumni Engineers Homecoming, the Engineering Building was named Melchor Hall in honor of the late Col. Alejandro Melchor.

It is a long horizontal, five-story reinforced concrete building designed in planar forms tempered with Filipino design expression. Internal spaces flow rather than being rigidly boxed.\n\nMelchor Hall is a symmetrical structure which is divided into two wings by an imposing central section. This large rectangular three-story-high portal serves as the main entrance of the building. An equally imposing concrete stairway terminates at the portal, flanked by 2 plain columns that soar three stories high.\n\nEach wing of the structure features continuous open balconies on each floor which serve as single-loaded corridors to the classrooms. The architectural design creates well-ventilated, naturally-lighted classrooms. Stairs that service the five floors are wide with comfortable treads and risers. Structural members are in all honesty defined on both the exterior and interior of the building. There is a grid of discreet sun baffles at the west side of the entrance hall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valera-Turalba|first1=Maria Cristina|title=Philippine Heritage Architecture: Before 1521 to the 1970s|date=2005|publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc.|location=8007-B Pioneer St., Brgy.

This makes the Logscript older than the U.P. College of Mass Communication's ''Plaridel''.\n\nFunding for the publication comes from the shared Logscript/Engineering Student Council (ESC) fee paid by students every semester. Unlike other college-based student publications in the university, the Logscript does not have an assigned formal office.\n\nThough the publication's logo and/or masthead varies with every change of the editorial board, the College of Engineering Sundial (or a semblance of it) is always incorporated into the design. The [[Sundial]] is a university landmark erected by the U.P. Alumni Engineers.\n\n===''The Sundial''===\n\n''The Sundial'' is the official newsletter of the U.P. Alumni Engineers. Carrying the motto \"The time of day it reckons, U.P. Engineers it beckons\", the Sundial's first issue came out on October 25, 2004.

Founded in 1999, Parser (as it is commonly known) is the oldest department-based publication in the College of Engineering. After a few years of inactivity, Parser was revived in 2004, appearing in four different versions: the print circulation, a website, an email newsletter, and a bulletin board version. In the academic year 2005\u20132006, Parser reached a milestone by releasing two full-color, tabloid-sized editions, a feat rare for department-based publications.\n\nThe newspaper takes its name from the [[parser]] of computer science. Its motto is \"Analyzing life the CS way\".\n\n===The Reactor===\n\n''The Reactor'' is the official newsletter of the Department of Chemical Engineering.\n\n===Currents===\n\n''Currents'' is the official student publication of the [[UP Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering|Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering]].
