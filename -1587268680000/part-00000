''Orient'' was a near-twin vessel of a steamer built at the same time, the [[Occident (sternwheeler)|''Occident'']].\n\n''Orient'' served until 1892 on the [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[Yamhill River|Yamhill]] rivers, after which it was sold for a small amount to a new owner who thought the steamer could be put to some use.  ''Orient'' was operated until 1894, and had tendency to sink during its last years in service.\n\nIn April 1893, ''Orient'' sank after a collision with a bridge in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1893, sank again on the [[Cowlitz River]] in March 1894, and then in September 1894 was completely destroyed by fire while efforts were being made to return ''Orient'' to service.\n\n==Construction==\n''Orient'' was designed to have a shallow draft so that it could operate during low water seasons on the upper [[Willamette River]].<ref name = NewSteamer>{{Cite news\n| title = New Steamer \u2014The O.S.N.

Shortly after its completion, it was acquired by the [[Oregon Steam Navigation Company]].  ''Orient'' was a near-twin vessel of a steamer built at the same time, the [[Occident (sternwheeler)|''Occident'']].\n\n''Orient'' served until 1892 on the [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[Yamhill River|Yamhill]] rivers, after which it was sold for a small amount to a new owner who thought the steamer could be put to some use.  ''Orient'' was operated until 1894, and had tendency to sink during its last years in service.\n\nIn April 1893, ''Orient'' sank after a collision with a bridge in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1893, sank again on the [[Cowlitz River]] in March 1894, and then in September 1894 was completely destroyed by fire while efforts were being made to return ''Orient'' to service.\n\n==Construction==\n''Orient'' was designed to have a shallow draft so that it could operate during low water seasons on the upper [[Willamette River]].<ref name = NewSteamer>{{Cite news\n| title = New Steamer \u2014The O.S.N.

Instead of the usual concepts of Hollywood Week with Lines of Ten, Group Rounds, and Solo Round, this season the 167 contestants faced the Genre Challenge. The contestants chose from genres given, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Country, and Singer-Songwriter, and picked a song and were assessed amongst their group. After all  performed, the judges brought the contestants to stage, similar to Lines of Ten, and made their decision. The Group Round was replaced with a Duet Round, in which the remaining contestants picked a duet partner and their song from a list provided. They were given twelve hours to rehearse including a session with a vocal coach, and later, a stage rehearsal. The judges decided if one, both, or neither moved to the Solo Round for which the remaining contestants performed with a backing band. The Top 40 were flown to Hawaii for a Showcase round to determine the Top 20 advancing to the live shows.\n\n== Showcase Round ==\nThe Showcase Round aired on March 29 and April 5, featuring the top forty performing for the judges and a live audience at [[Aulani]] resort in [[Kapolei, Hawaii]]. The following day, the judges narrowed the number of contestants down to twenty-one in the Final Judgment. The following is a list of the contestants who performed, the song they performed at the Showcase, and if they advanced or not. The placement of Grace Leer and Lauren Mascitti will be determined by a vote.\n\n'''Color key:'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 90%; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:cyan; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Male contestant\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"background:pink; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Female contestant\n|-\n| style=\"background:#B0E0E6; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was chosen by the judges to move on to the Top 20\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF91A4; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was eliminated\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:17px; width:100%; white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n!

received. \n\nAccording to Andy Swift of TVLine, \u201cWith only one spot remaining, the judges revealed that they can\u2019t (and won\u2019t!) choose between the two remaining contestants, Grace Leer and Lauren Mascitti. In the judges\u2019 defense, both women are 28-year-old country powerhouses from Nashville, so comparisons are bound to be drawn. That said, I\u2019m not really sure why they weren\u2019t both sent through to the Top 20 over some of the previous contestants that the judges weren\u2019t 100-percent certain about. And there were several of those.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s now up to viewers to go online and vote for the performance they preferred \u2014 Grace\u2019s killer rendition of \u2018(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\u2019 or Lauren\u2019s crowd-pleasing \u2018Two More Bottles of Wine.\u2019 Again, I feel like both Grace and Lauren deserve to be in the Top 20 over some other contestants that were sent through before them.\u201d<ref>Swift, Andy.

Instead of the usual concepts of Hollywood Week with Lines of Ten, Group Rounds, and Solo Round, this season the 167 contestants faced the Genre Challenge. The contestants chose from genres given, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Country, and Singer-Songwriter, and picked a song and were assessed amongst their group. After all  performed, the judges brought the contestants to stage, similar to Lines of Ten, and made their decision. The Group Round was replaced with a Duet Round, in which the remaining contestants picked a duet partner and their song from a list provided. They were given twelve hours to rehearse including a session with a vocal coach, and later, a stage rehearsal. The judges decided if one, both, or neither moved to the Solo Round for which the remaining contestants performed with a backing band. The Top 40 were flown to Hawaii for a Showcase round to determine the Top 20 advancing to the live shows.\n\n== Showcase Round ==\nThe Showcase Round aired on March 29 and April 5, featuring the top forty performing for the judges and a live audience at [[Aulani]] resort in [[Kapolei, Hawaii]]. The following day, the judges narrowed the number of contestants down to twenty-one in the Final Judgment. The following is a list of the contestants who performed, the song they performed at the Showcase, and if they advanced or not. The placement of Grace Leer and Lauren Mascitti will be determined by a vote.\n\n'''Color key:'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 90%; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:cyan; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Male contestant\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"background:pink; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Female contestant\n|-\n| style=\"background:#B0E0E6; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was chosen by the judges to move on to the Top 20\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF91A4; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was eliminated\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:17px; width:100%; white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n!

The circular building at the entrance onto the Forum (not used today) was built in the early 4th century as a [[Roman temple]], thought to have been dedicated to [[Valerius Romulus]], [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|deified]] son of the emperor [[Maxentius]]. The main building was perhaps the library of an imperial forum. \n\nIt became a church in 527 and contains important but much restored [[early Christian art]], especially in its mosaics.  \n\nToday it is one of the ancient [[Churches of Rome#Ancient churches|churches]] called ''[[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|tituli]]'', of which cardinals are patrons as [[cardinal-deacon]]s: the current [[Cardinal Deacon]] of the ''Titulus Ss. Cosmae et Damiani'' is [[Beniamino Stella]], created Cardinal on 22 February 2014. The basilica, devoted to the two [[Arabian]] Christian brothers, doctors, martyrs and saints [[Sts. Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]], is located in the [[Imperial forums|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Roma-basilica cosma e damiano.jpg|thumb|left|The modern street entrance]]\n\nThe Temple is traditionally held to have been dedicated by Emperor [[Maxentius]] to his son and co-[[Roman consul|consul]] [[Valerius Romulus]], who died in 309 and was given divine honours. The temple building was probably part of a rebuilding program of \"incredible intensity\" undertaken by Maxentius in the area, following a disastrous fire in 306; the project was only part-complete at his death. The temple's identification with Valerius Romulus is tentative, based on the spot-find of a coin dated to 307 AD showing the distinctive shape of the building, and a nearby dedication to Valerius Romulus as [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|a divinised mortal]].<ref>Hunt, E. D., \"Imperial Building at Rome: The Role of Constantine\"; in Cornell, T, and Lomas,''Bread and Circuses': Euergetism and Municipal Patronage in Roman Italy'', Routledge, 2005, pp 106\u2013107.</ref> The temple has also been speculated as a rebuilding of the original [[temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|temple of \"Jupiter Stator\"]], or one dedicated to [[Penates]], restored by Maxentius. \n\nThe temple was [[Christianized]] and dedicated to ''Sancti Cosma et Damianus'' in 527, when [[Theodoric the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]], and his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] donated the library of the [[Forum of Peace]] (''Bibliotheca Pacis'') and a portion of the Temple of Romulus to [[Pope Felix IV]]. The pope united the two buildings to create a basilica devoted to two [[Arabian]] Christian brothers and saints, Cosmas and Damian, in contrast with the ancient pagan cult of the two brothers [[Castor and Pollux]], who had been worshipped in the nearby [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]]. The apse was decorated with a Roman-Byzantine mosaic, representing a ''[[parousia]]'', the [[Second Coming]] of [[Christ]] at the end of time. The bodies of Saints [[Mark and Marcellian]] were [[translation (relic)|translated]], perhaps in the ninth century, to this church, where they were rediscovered in 1583  during the reign of [[Pope Gregory XIII]].\n\nIn 1632, [[Pope Urban VIII]] ordered the restoration of the basilica. The works, projected by [[Orazio Torriani]] and directed by Luigi Arrigucci, raised the floor level seven metres, bringing it equal with the ''[[Campo Vaccino]]'', thus avoiding the infiltration of water. Also, a cloister was added. The old floor of the basilica is still visible in the lower church, which is actually the lower part of the first church.\n\nIn 1947, the restorations of the Imperial Forums gave a new structure to the church. The old entrance, through the ''Temple of Romulus'', was closed, and the temple restored to its original forms; with the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the ''Temple of Romulus'' is the best preserved pagan temple in Rome. A new entrance was opened on the opposite side (on ''via dei Fori Imperiali''), whose arch gives access to the cloister, and through this to the side of the basilica.\n\n== Structure and art ==\n[[File:CosmaDamianoPlan.jpg|thumb|Plan of the Basilica and Monastery]]\n[[Image:Santi Cosma e Damiano (Roma) - Interior.jpg|thumb|310px|left|The mosaics, with the ''[[parousia]]'' of Christ, among saints.]]\nNext to the new entrance to the complex, there are the rooms with the original marble paving of the Forum of Peace, and the wall where the 150 marble slabs of the ''[[Forma Urbis Romae]]'' were hung. Through the cloister, the entrance to the church opens on the side of the single nave. The plan of the basilica followed the norms of the [[Counter-Reformation]]: a single nave, with three chapels per side, and the big apse, which now looks quite oversized because of the reduction in height of the 17th-century restoration, framed by the triumphal arch, also mutilated by that restoration.\n\nThe mosaics are masterpieces of 6th- and 7th-century art. In the middle is Christ, with [[Saint Peter]] presenting Saint [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas]] and Saint [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodorus]] (right), and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] presenting [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Saint Damian]] and [[Pope Felix IV]]; the latter holds a model of the church.\n\n==History of medicine==\n[[Image:Pope Felix presents church to Cosmas and Damian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Felix IV]] presents Saints Cosmas and Damian with the basilica he [[consecration|rededicated]] to them.|299x299px]]The importance of this basilica for the [[history of medicine]] is not only related to the fact that the two brothers were physicians and were honoured as patron saints of physicians, surgeons, pharmacists and veterinarians, with veneration dating from the mid 5th century CE,but also to the tradition according to which [[Claudius Galen]] himself lectured in the Library of the Temple of Peace (\"Bibliotheca Pacis\").{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Furthermore, for centuries, in this \"medical area\"{{vague|date=March 2016}} Roman physicians had their meetings.<ref>Cfr L.

The circular building at the entrance onto the Forum (not used today) was built in the early 4th century as a [[Roman temple]], thought to have been dedicated to [[Valerius Romulus]], [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|deified]] son of the emperor [[Maxentius]]. The main building was perhaps the library of an imperial forum. \n\nIt became a church in 527 and contains important but much restored [[early Christian art]], especially in its mosaics.  \n\nToday it is one of the ancient [[Churches of Rome#Ancient churches|churches]] called ''[[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|tituli]]'', of which cardinals are patrons as [[cardinal-deacon]]s: the current [[Cardinal Deacon]] of the ''Titulus Ss. Cosmae et Damiani'' is [[Beniamino Stella]], created Cardinal on 22 February 2014. The basilica, devoted to the two [[Arabian]] Christian brothers, doctors, martyrs and saints [[Sts. Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]], is located in the [[Imperial forums|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Roma-basilica cosma e damiano.jpg|thumb|left|The modern street entrance]]\n\nThe Temple is traditionally held to have been dedicated by Emperor [[Maxentius]] to his son and co-[[Roman consul|consul]] [[Valerius Romulus]], who died in 309 and was given divine honours. The temple building was probably part of a rebuilding program of \"incredible intensity\" undertaken by Maxentius in the area, following a disastrous fire in 306; the project was only part-complete at his death. The temple's identification with Valerius Romulus is tentative, based on the spot-find of a coin dated to 307 AD showing the distinctive shape of the building, and a nearby dedication to Valerius Romulus as [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|a divinised mortal]].<ref>Hunt, E. D., \"Imperial Building at Rome: The Role of Constantine\"; in Cornell, T, and Lomas,''Bread and Circuses': Euergetism and Municipal Patronage in Roman Italy'', Routledge, 2005, pp 106\u2013107.</ref> The temple has also been speculated as a rebuilding of the original [[temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|temple of \"Jupiter Stator\"]], or one dedicated to [[Penates]], restored by Maxentius. \n\nThe temple was [[Christianized]] and dedicated to ''Sancti Cosma et Damianus'' in 527, when [[Theodoric the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]], and his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] donated the library of the [[Forum of Peace]] (''Bibliotheca Pacis'') and a portion of the Temple of Romulus to [[Pope Felix IV]]. The pope united the two buildings to create a basilica devoted to two [[Arabian]] Christian brothers and saints, Cosmas and Damian, in contrast with the ancient pagan cult of the two brothers [[Castor and Pollux]], who had been worshipped in the nearby [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]]. The apse was decorated with a Roman-Byzantine mosaic, representing a ''[[parousia]]'', the [[Second Coming]] of [[Christ]] at the end of time. The bodies of Saints [[Mark and Marcellian]] were [[translation (relic)|translated]], perhaps in the ninth century, to this church, where they were rediscovered in 1583  during the reign of [[Pope Gregory XIII]].\n\nIn 1632, [[Pope Urban VIII]] ordered the restoration of the basilica. The works, projected by [[Orazio Torriani]] and directed by Luigi Arrigucci, raised the floor level seven metres, bringing it equal with the ''[[Campo Vaccino]]'', thus avoiding the infiltration of water. Also, a cloister was added. The old floor of the basilica is still visible in the lower church, which is actually the lower part of the first church.\n\nIn 1947, the restorations of the Imperial Forums gave a new structure to the church. The old entrance, through the ''Temple of Romulus'', was closed, and the temple restored to its original forms; with the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the ''Temple of Romulus'' is the best preserved pagan temple in Rome. A new entrance was opened on the opposite side (on ''via dei Fori Imperiali''), whose arch gives access to the cloister, and through this to the side of the basilica.\n\n== Structure and art ==\n[[File:CosmaDamianoPlan.jpg|thumb|Plan of the Basilica and Monastery]]\n[[Image:Santi Cosma e Damiano (Roma) - Interior.jpg|thumb|310px|left|The mosaics, with the ''[[parousia]]'' of Christ, among saints.]]\nNext to the new entrance to the complex, there are the rooms with the original marble paving of the Forum of Peace, and the wall where the 150 marble slabs of the ''[[Forma Urbis Romae]]'' were hung. Through the cloister, the entrance to the church opens on the side of the single nave. The plan of the basilica followed the norms of the [[Counter-Reformation]]: a single nave, with three chapels per side, and the big apse, which now looks quite oversized because of the reduction in height of the 17th-century restoration, framed by the triumphal arch, also mutilated by that restoration.\n\nThe mosaics are masterpieces of 6th- and 7th-century art. In the middle is Christ, with [[Saint Peter]] presenting Saint [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas]] and Saint [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodorus]] (right), and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] presenting [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Saint Damian]] and [[Pope Felix IV]]; the latter holds a model of the church.\n\n==History of medicine==\n[[Image:Pope Felix presents church to Cosmas and Damian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Felix IV]] presents Saints Cosmas and Damian with the basilica he [[consecration|rededicated]] to them.|299x299px]]The importance of this basilica for the [[history of medicine]] is not only related to the fact that the two brothers were physicians and were honoured as patron saints of physicians, surgeons, pharmacists and veterinarians, with veneration dating from the mid 5th century CE,but also to the tradition according to which [[Claudius Galen]] himself lectured in the Library of the Temple of Peace (\"Bibliotheca Pacis\").{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Furthermore, for centuries, in this \"medical area\"{{vague|date=March 2016}} Roman physicians had their meetings.<ref>Cfr L.
