On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a fresh rating of 88% based on 62 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] of 7.22/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"''Riverdale'' offers an amusingly self-aware reimagining of its classic source material that proves eerie, odd, daring, and above all addictive.\"<ref name=\"RTS1\" /> On [[Metacritic]], the season has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"MCS1\" /> Dave Nemetz of [[TVLine]] gave the series a \"B+\" saying that it turned out \"to be an artfully crafted, instantly engaging teen soap with loads of potential.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://tvline.com/2017/01/05/riverdale-review-the-cw-archie-comics-reboot-premiere/ |title='Riverdale' Review: Archie Gets a Dark, Moody Update\u2026 and Surprise, It Works! |magazine=TVLine |last=Nemetz |first=Dave |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome writers have criticized the series for its handling of minority characters.

{"title_page": "Glycogenesis", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Gluconeogenesis|Glycogenolysis}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Glycogenesis''' is the process of [[glycogen]] synthesis, in which [[glucose]] molecules are added to chains of glycogen for storage. This process is activated during rest periods following the [[Cori cycle]], in the [[liver]], and also activated by [[insulin]] in response to high [[glucose level]]s. It\u2019s not correct\n\n==Steps==\n[[File:Glycogenesis.png|thumb]]\n\n* Glucose C6H12O6 is converted to C6H13O3P, or glucose 6-phosphate\n*[[Glucose]] is converted into [[glucose 6-phosphate]] by the action of [[glucokinase]] or [[hexokinase]] with conversion of ATP to ADP.\n* Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into [[glucose-1-phosphate]] by the action of [[phosphoglucomutase]], passing through the obligatory intermediate [[glucose-1,6-bisphosphate]].\n* Glucose-1-phosphate is converted into [[UDP-glucose]] by the action of the enzyme [[UTP\u2014glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase|UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase]]. [[Pyrophosphate]] is formed, which is later hydrolysed by [[pyrophosphatase]] into two phosphate molecules.\n* The enzyme [[glycogenin]] is needed to create initial short glycogen chains, which are then lengthened and branched by the other enzymes of glycogenesis. [[Glycogenin]], a homodimer, has a [[tyrosine]] residue on each subunit that serves as the anchor for the reducing end of glycogen. Initially, about seven UDP-glucose molecules are added to each tyrosine residue by glycogenin, forming \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds.\n* Once a chain of seven glucose monomers is formed, [[glycogen synthase]] binds to the growing glycogen chain and adds UDP-glucose to the 4-hydroxyl group of the glucosyl residue on the non-reducing end of the glycogen chain, forming more \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds in the process.\n* Branches are made by [[glycogen branching enzyme]] (also known as amylo-\u03b1(1:4)\u2192\u03b1(1:6)transglycosylase), which transfers the end of the chain onto an earlier part via \u03b1-1:6 glycosidic bond, forming branches, which further grow by addition of more \u03b1-1:4 glycosidic units.\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

This is regulated by enzymes under the control of hormonal activity, which is in turn regulated by many factors. As such, there are many different possible effectors when compared to allosteric systems of regulation.\n\n===Epinephrine (adrenaline)===\n\n{{see also|Epinephrine}}\n\nGlycogen phosphorylase is activated by phosphorylation, whereas glycogen synthase is inhibited.\n\nGlycogen  phosphorylase is converted from its less active \"b\" form to an active \"a\" form by the enzyme phosphorylase kinase. This latter enzyme is itself activated by protein kinase A and deactivated by phosphoprotein phosphatase-1.\n\nProtein kinase A itself is activated by the [[hormone]] adrenaline. [[Epinephrine]] binds to a receptor protein that activates adenylate cyclase. The latter enzyme causes the formation of [[cyclic AMP]] from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; two molecules of [[cyclic AMP]] bind to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, which activates it allowing the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A to dissociate from the assembly and to phosphorylate other proteins.\n\nReturning to glycogen phosphorylase, the less active \"b\" form can itself be activated without the conformational change. 5'AMP acts as an allosteric activator, whereas ATP is an inhibitor, as already seen with [[phosphofructokinase]] control, helping to change the rate of flux in response to energy demand.\n\n[[Epinephrine]] not only activates [[glycogen phosphorylase]] but also inhibits glycogen synthase. This amplifies the effect of activating glycogen phosphorylase. This inhibition is achieved by a similar mechanism, as protein kinase A acts to phosphorylate the enzyme, which lowers activity. This is known as co-ordinate reciprocal control. Refer to [[glycolysis]] for further information of the regulation of glycogenesis.\n\n\n===Calcium ions===\n\nCalcium ions or [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) act as secondary messengers. This is an example of negative control. The calcium ions activate phosphorylase kinase. This activates glycogen phosphorylase and inhibits glycogen synthase.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Glycogenolysis]]\n*[[Glycogen synthase]]\n*[[Glycogen storage disease]]\n\n==External links==\n\n\n{{Carbohydrate metabolism}}\n{{MetabolismMap}}\n{{Glycogenesis and glycogenolysis metabolic intermediates}}\n{{Glycogenesis and glycogenolysis}}\n\n[[Category:Metabolic pathways]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Gluconeogenesis|Glycogenolysis}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Glycogenesis''' is the process of [[glycogen]] synthesis, in which [[glucose]] molecules are added to chains of glycogen for storage.

Initially, about seven UDP-glucose molecules are added to each tyrosine residue by glycogenin, forming \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds.\n* Once a chain of seven glucose monomers is formed, [[glycogen synthase]] binds to the growing glycogen chain and adds UDP-glucose to the 4-hydroxyl group of the glucosyl residue on the non-reducing end of the glycogen chain, forming more \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds in the process.\n* Branches are made by [[glycogen branching enzyme]] (also known as amylo-\u03b1(1:4)\u2192\u03b1(1:6)transglycosylase), which transfers the end of the chain onto an earlier part via \u03b1-1:6 glycosidic bond, forming branches, which further grow by addition of more \u03b1-1:4 glycosidic units.\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! Metabolism of common [[monosaccharide]]s, including [[glycolysis]], [[gluconeogenesis]], glycogenesis and [[glycogenolysis]]\n|-\n|[[File:Metabolism of common monosaccharides, and related reactions.png|none|1000px]]\n|}\n\n==Control and regulations==\nGlycogenesis responds to hormonal control.\n\nOne of the main forms of control is the varied phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. This is regulated by enzymes under the control of hormonal activity, which is in turn regulated by many factors. As such, there are many different possible effectors when compared to allosteric systems of regulation.\n\n===Epinephrine (adrenaline)===\n\n{{see also|Epinephrine}}\n\nGlycogen phosphorylase is activated by phosphorylation, whereas glycogen synthase is inhibited.\n\nGlycogen  phosphorylase is converted from its less active \"b\" form to an active \"a\" form by the enzyme phosphorylase kinase. This latter enzyme is itself activated by protein kinase A and deactivated by phosphoprotein phosphatase-1.\n\nProtein kinase A itself is activated by the [[hormone]] adrenaline. [[Epinephrine]] binds to a receptor protein that activates adenylate cyclase. The latter enzyme causes the formation of [[cyclic AMP]] from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; two molecules of [[cyclic AMP]] bind to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, which activates it allowing the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A to dissociate from the assembly and to phosphorylate other proteins.\n\nReturning to glycogen phosphorylase, the less active \"b\" form can itself be activated without the conformational change. 5'AMP acts as an allosteric activator, whereas ATP is an inhibitor, as already seen with [[phosphofructokinase]] control, helping to change the rate of flux in response to energy demand.\n\n[[Epinephrine]] not only activates [[glycogen phosphorylase]] but also inhibits glycogen synthase. This amplifies the effect of activating glycogen phosphorylase. This inhibition is achieved by a similar mechanism, as protein kinase A acts to phosphorylate the enzyme, which lowers activity. This is known as co-ordinate reciprocal control. Refer to [[glycolysis]] for further information of the regulation of glycogenesis.\n\n\n===Calcium ions===\n\nCalcium ions or [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) act as secondary messengers. This is an example of negative control. The calcium ions activate phosphorylase kinase. This activates glycogen phosphorylase and inhibits glycogen synthase.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Glycogenolysis]]\n*[[Glycogen synthase]]\n*[[Glycogen storage disease]]\n\n==External links==\n\n\n{{Carbohydrate metabolism}}\n{{MetabolismMap}}\n{{Glycogenesis and glycogenolysis metabolic intermediates}}\n{{Glycogenesis and glycogenolysis}}\n\n[[Category:Metabolic pathways]]\n", "name_user": "2601:197:c7f:c60:c954:a37f:3b01:5efd", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogenesis"}

The family was French-speaking despite its Flemish roots; his mother's maiden name was De Ridder. He studied art at the [[Brussels Academy]] in 1924 under [[James Ensor]], but halted his studies in 1925 for lack of funding, first working in a stained glass studio, then designing wallpaper \u2013 both of which experiences are actively reflected in many of his works. He also worked as a freelance cartoonist, but painted all the while. In 1933 he studied briefly under [[Henri Matisse]] in France (see [[#Anecdotes|Anecdotes]]), having met him by chance in an artist's supply shop in [[Cagnes]], France. Thereafter he continued to paint and study full-time thanks to the sponsorship of his elder brother, Joseph Charles, and a group of friends.\n\nHis break came in July 1939 when he won a scholarship in a competition organised by the Belgian Government, who commissioned him to undertake a painting expedition to the [[Belgian Congo]]. His travels and experiences there influenced him profoundly, and the visions and emotions of that period echoed through his work for the rest of his life. In 1940 his wife Lucette (n\u00e9e Josz, 1908\u20131997) and son Ludovic (1935 \u2013 ) fled German occupation of [[Belgium]] and joined him in the Congo. Lucette could not cope with tropical conditions and they moved to the relatively milder climate of the South African Cape rather than return to war-torn Europe.\n\nEarly days in South Africa were difficult, and on occasion van Essche traded paintings and drawings for food and other essentials. But he soon became a prominent member of the South African art community, exhibiting locally and later in Europe as well. As an active member of [http://www.sahistory.org.za/media-and-journalism/new-group The New Group] he contributed strongly to contemporary art in South Africa. He had a solid knowledge of both modern art trends and the history of European painting which he imparted in his role as teacher, a profession he regarded as equally important as creating. He taught at the<ref>Witwatersrand</ref> Technical Art School from 1943 to 1945. In 1948 he founded the Continental School of Art in [[Cape Town]], leaving in 1951 to become a lecturer at the [[Michaelis School of Fine Art]] at the [[University of Cape Town]].  He was appointed Professor of Fine Art in 1962 (see [[#Anecdotes|Anecdotes]]) and his success as a teacher is attested to by the number of his former pupils who have become prominent artists themselves.\n\nVan Essche retired from academia in 1971, but continued to paint prolifically, despite poor health, including several heart attacks. He travelled in Europe and eventually settled near [[Thonon]], France, at his wife's behest. His health continued to deteriorate, and he could not travel to attend his own retrospective exhibition in [[Cape Town]] in 1974. He missed Africa terribly, painting African scenes while searching in vain for local inspiration. His new themes included hippies and musicians, but he destroyed much of this work. His European landscapes from this period are dark and depressed, in stark contrast to the vibrant African scenes that flowed nonetheless. His oils continued to sell well in South Africa, and his reputation grew. He succumbed to a heart attack in June 1977 following a fall, and poor medical care.\n\n==Chronological summary==\n\n* 1906 Born in Antwerp, Belgium\n* 1911 Family moved to Brussels; educated there\n* 1925 Interrupted his studies to earn a living working in stained glass studio\n* 1930 Became a member of the group 'La Jeune Peinture Belge'; won silver medal at the International Exhibition, Antwerp\n* 1933 Married Lucie Josz; studied under Matisse in South of France; group and one-man exhibitions in Paris and Belgian centres\n* 1939 Government sponsored painting expedition to Belgian Congo\n* 1940 Moved to South Africa; stayed temporarily in Cape Town; began exhibiting in South Africa\n* 1943 to 1945 Lectured at Wits Tech Art School, member of New Group\n* 1946 Founded Continental School of Art, Cape Town\n* 1948\u201365 Regularly represented South Africa at international art exhibitions\n* 1948 Foundation member of International Art Club; exhibited with fellow members in Turin, later elected chairman\n* 1951 Awarded the title of Chevalier de Leopold II by King Baudouin of Belgium\n* 1952 Appointed lecturer in Fine Art, Michaelis School, Cape Town; reputation in South Africa grown considerably; continued to exhibit at intervals in Europe\n* 1962 Appointed Professor of Fine Art, Michaelis School, University of Cape Town\n* 1966 Awarded Medal of Honour for Painting by South African Akademie\n* 1967 Subject of monograph 'Van Essche', by Carl Buchner\n* 1970 Retired from Michaelis School.\n* 1971 Departed for Europe; settled in Thonon-les-Bains, France.\n* 1972 Awarded the title Officer of Order of Leopold II by King Baudouin of Belgium.\n* 1974 Unable to attend Prestige Retrospective Exhibition of his work, South African National Art Gallery and Pretoria Art Museum\n* 1977 Deceased 12 June, Thonon, France.\n\n==Art==\n\nVan Essche's work exhibits contrasting influences, both artistic and environmental.

Due to some similarities in appearance, and especially the style of glasses both men wore, he was often mistaken for [[Le Corbusier]], much to his delight and amusement. It is unknown whether the two ever met.\n\n'''As Professor of Fine Art at the [[University of Cape Town]]''' van Essche shared the position of Dean of Art and Architecture on an annual rotating basis with [http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=1881 William Leonard Thornton WHITE], referred to by colleagues and friends as Thornton-White, until Thornton-White's death in 1965.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\n* 1927 First one-man exhibition, Brussels.\n* 1930 and 1935 La Jeune Peinture Belge, Brussels and Paris.\n* 1937 Ghent Salon.\n* 1939 One-man art exhibitions, Elizabethville, Leopoldville.\n* 1941 First South African one-man art exhibition, Cape Town.\n* 1948 Overseas Exhibition of South African Art, Tate Gallery.\n* 1948 to 1952 Exhibitions of International Art Club, South Africa.\n* 1950 Venice Bienalle.\n* 1952 Van Riebeeck Tercent Exhibition, Cape Town; Venice Bienalle.\n* 1953 Rhodes Centenary Exhibition, Bulawayo.\n* 1954 Venice Bienalle.\n* 1956 First Quad of South African Art.\n* 1957 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1960 Second Quad of South African Art.\n* 1961 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1963 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1965 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1966 Republic Fest Exhibition, Pretoria.\n* 1969 Group Exhibition, 'Le Petit Palais', Geneva.\n* 1971 Republic Fest Exhibition.\n* 1974/5 Prestige Retrospective Exhibition, South African National Art Gallery and Pretoria Art Museum.\n\n==Public Collections==\nSouth African National Art Gallery; Johannesburg Art Gallery; Pretoria Art museum; Durban Art Gallery; William Humphreys Art Gallery; AC White Gallery, Bloemfontein; Hester Rupert Museum; Rembrandt Foundation; King George VI Gallery; University of Wits Art Gallery, UNISA.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* van Essche, by Carl Buchner, 1967, Tafelberg, Cape Town, South Africa\n* Art & Artists of South Africa by E.

The fourth generation Coaster incorporates many safety features as standard including air-bags for the driver and front passenger, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), a ringed frame body for increased roll-over protection, pre-tensioners for the seat belts and force limiters which reduce the pressure on the passenger's chest in the event of a collision.\n\nThe height was increased by {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the width was increased by {{convert|40|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and the window height was increased by {{convert|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} over the outgoing model.

The windshield was widened for increased outward visibility. The Coaster is available in three configurations; the standard wheelbase configuration can seat 25 passengers, the long wheelbase configuration can either seat 24 or 29 passengers while a school bus configuration can seat 3 adults and 49 children.

The fourth generation Coaster incorporates many safety features as standard including air-bags for the driver and front passenger, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), a ringed frame body for increased roll-over protection, pre-tensioners for the seat belts and force limiters which reduce the pressure on the passenger's chest in the event of a collision.\n\nThe height was increased by {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the width was increased by {{convert|40|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and the window height was increased by {{convert|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} over the outgoing model. The door step were also lengthened by {{convert|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for easier entry and exit. The body was designed in a square shape for a more spacious seating space. The windshield was widened for increased outward visibility. The Coaster is available in three configurations; the standard wheelbase configuration can seat 25 passengers, the long wheelbase configuration can either seat 24 or 29 passengers while a school bus configuration can seat 3 adults and 49 children. The school bus configuration does not have a front passenger seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.toyota/en/detail/14574035|title=Toyota 'Coaster' Undergoes Model Change After 24 Years|date=22 December 2016|work=[[Toyota]]|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autodeal.com.ph/articles/car-news-philippines/toyota-launch-all-new-coaster-model-after-24-years|title=Toyota to launch all-new Coaster model after 24 years|date=23 December 2016|first=Jacob|last=Oliva|publisher=Auto Deal|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n* BB10{{Snd}} [[Toyota B engine#2B|2B engine]]{{Snd}} First Generation diesel, 22\u201325 passengers<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.customcoasterconversions.com.au/Toyota-Coaster.html |title=Toyota Coaster Variants |publisher=Custom Coaster |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n* RB20{{Snd}} [[Toyota R engine#22R|22R]] 2.4-litre petrol engine, 26 passengers\n* BB21/BB22/BB23{{Snd}} 3B/13B/14B 4-cyl engine, 26 passengers (1981\u20131993)\n* HB30{{Snd}} 2H Engine, 30 passengers\n* HB31{{Snd}} 12H-T turbo engine for EX models, sliding door (1981\u20131990)\n* HDB30{{Snd}} 1HD-T turbo engine for EX models (1989\u20131993)\n* HZB30{{Snd}} 1HZ engine, 30 passengers (1990\u20131993)\n* BB40{{Snd}} 3B engine, 26 passenger (1993\u20132003)\n* HZB40{{Snd}} 1HZ engine, 26 passengers\n* HZB50{{Snd}} 1HZ engine, 30 passengers (1993\u20132016)\n* HZB51{{Snd}} 1HZ turbo engine, Intercooler 30 passengers (1993\u20132012)\n* HDB50{{Snd}} 1HD turbo engine, non airbag suspension (1993\u20132003)\n* HDB51{{Snd}} 1HD turbo engine, airbag suspension (1993\u20132003)\n* BB50{{Snd}} 15B-FTE 4-cyl turbo intercooled engine, 6-speed manual or auto (2003\u20132006)\n* XZB50/XZB51/XZB56 - Hino N04C 4-cyl turbo intercooled engine (2004\u20132016)\n* BB58{{Snd}} 15B (1997\u20131999) / 15B-FT (1999\u20132004) 4x4 factory built, uses Mega Cruiser's transmission and front portal axle differentials\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur 2017 08 (cropped).jpg|Toyota Coaster 1st generation\nFile:ToyotaCoaster 80s SmallDestinationDisplay.jpg|Toyota Coaster 2nd generation\nFile:Blue Poppy Toyota Coaster.JPG|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (pre-facelift, with round headlamps)\nFile:2008Computex Intel Staff Shuttle Bus A4-571.jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (pre-facelift, with rectangular headlamps)\nFile:Hokutetsu-Okunoto Coaster.jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (4WD, BB58)\nFile:Toyota Coaster 001.JPG|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (2001 facelift, low roof)\nFile:LD5080 Hong Kong Island 27 16-02-2019.jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 3rd generation (2001 facelift)\nFile:MW-78-61(Ka-Ho St. Jose School) 15-05-2019.jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (2007 facelift)\nFile:TG6403 Hong Kong Island 36X 11-04-2019.jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 3rd generation (2007 facelift)\nFile:050005 MinibusED884,NT90P(2).jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 3rd generation (2007 facelift)\nFile:UK5446 at Java Rd, North Point (20181005104023).jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (2007 facelift, super long wheelbase)\nFile:\u4e09\u91cd\u5ba2\u904b2018 Toyota Coaster XZB70L-ZEMSYR KKA-8066 603 .jpg|Toyota Coaster 4th generation\nFile:WP9187 New Territories 806A 03-03-2020.jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 4th generation\n</gallery>\n\n==Conversions==\nThe Toyota Coaster is used for [[motor home]] conversions.

A modern [[whodunit]], the film follows a family gathering gone awry, after the patriarch's death leads a master detective to investigate. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Daniel Craig]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Ana de Armas]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Jaeden Martell]], and [[Christopher Plummer]].\n\n''Knives Out'' had its world premiere at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 27, 2019, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its screenplay, direction, and acting, and grossed $312 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. At the [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], the film received three nominations in the Musical or Comedy category: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for Craig, and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]] for de Armas. It also received Best Original Screenplay nominations at the [[73rd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[92nd Academy Awards]]. It was also selected by the [[American Film Institute]] and the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the top ten films of 2019.\n\nLionsgate announced in February 2020 that a sequel was being considered.<ref name=\"sequel\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- KEEP THIS SHORT - as per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries must be under 700 words -->Wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey invites his family to his [[Massachusetts]] mansion for his 85th birthday party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead, with his throat slit. The police are convinced that Harlan's death is a suicide, but an anonymous party pays private detective Benoit Blanc to investigate.\n\nBlanc learns that Harlan's relationships with his family had become strained: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard for cheating on his wife Linda, cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt from his publishing company, and had an altercation with his [[black sheep]] grandson Ransom.\n\nUnknown to Blanc, after the party, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, accidentally administered him an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication and could not find the antidote, leaving Harlan minutes to live. To protect Marta, Harlan gave her instructions to create a [[Alibi#False alibi|false alibi]] to avoid suspicion over his death; he then slit his own throat. Marta carried out Harlan's instructions, but Harlan's elderly mother saw her and mistook her for Ransom.\n\nMarta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. Blanc asks her to assist his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence.\n\nHarlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta, to her astonishment as well as the family's. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom persuades Marta to confess to him and offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother as an [[undocumented immigrant]].\n\nMarta receives an anonymous blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's [[toxicology]] report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the destroyed medical examiner's office, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief [[car chase]], the police arrest Ransom; Blanc explains to Marta that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room on the night of his death.\n\nMarta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged, along with her missing medical case. Marta hesitates, realizing that Fran can link her to the crime, but performs [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Fran and calls 911. Marta confesses to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's [[cannabis]] stash. Marta is about to confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death, but Blanc interrupts her after reading the report.\n\nBlanc reveals his deductions to Marta, Ransom, and the police: After Ransom learned at the party that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the [[slayer rule]]. However, Marta actually administered the correct medicine without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the blackmail note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder.\n\nMarta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses and vows revenge, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and he is taken into custody as Marta watches the Thrombeys depart from what is now her mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Benoit Blanc: A world-famous private detective\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Hugh Ransom Drysdale: Harlan's grandson (Linda and Richard's son), a spoiled playboy\n* [[Ana de Armas]] as Marta Cabrera: Harlan's nurse and close friend\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Linda Drysdale: Harlan's eldest daughter, a real estate mogul\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Walter \"Walt\" Thrombey: Harlan's youngest son, Harlan's publishing company CEO\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Richard Drysdale: Harlan's son-in-law (Linda's husband)\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Joni Thrombey: Harlan's daughter-in-law (widow of Neil), a [[lifestyle guru]]\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Detective Lieutenant Elliot: A local detective\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as Megan \"Meg\" Thrombey: Harlan's granddaughter (Joni and Neil's daughter), a liberal student\n* [[Jaeden Martell]] as Jacob Thrombey: Harlan's grandson (Walt and Donna's son), an alt-right youth\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Harlan Thrombey: A wealthy mystery novelist found dead after his 85th birthday party.

Johnson]], and produced by Johnson and [[Ram Bergman]]. A modern [[whodunit]], the film follows a family gathering gone awry, after the patriarch's death leads a master detective to investigate. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Daniel Craig]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Ana de Armas]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Jaeden Martell]], and [[Christopher Plummer]].\n\n''Knives Out'' had its world premiere at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 27, 2019, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its screenplay, direction, and acting, and grossed $312 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. At the [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], the film received three nominations in the Musical or Comedy category: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for Craig, and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]] for de Armas. It also received Best Original Screenplay nominations at the [[73rd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[92nd Academy Awards]]. It was also selected by the [[American Film Institute]] and the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the top ten films of 2019.\n\nLionsgate announced in February 2020 that a sequel was being considered.<ref name=\"sequel\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- KEEP THIS SHORT - as per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries must be under 700 words -->Wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey invites his family to his [[Massachusetts]] mansion for his 85th birthday party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead, with his throat slit. The police are convinced that Harlan's death is a suicide, but an anonymous party pays private detective Benoit Blanc to investigate.\n\nBlanc learns that Harlan's relationships with his family had become strained: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard for cheating on his wife Linda, cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt from his publishing company, and had an altercation with his [[black sheep]] grandson Ransom.\n\nUnknown to Blanc, after the party, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, accidentally administered him an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication and could not find the antidote, leaving Harlan minutes to live. To protect Marta, Harlan gave her instructions to create a [[Alibi#False alibi|false alibi]] to avoid suspicion over his death; he then slit his own throat. Marta carried out Harlan's instructions, but Harlan's elderly mother saw her and mistook her for Ransom.\n\nMarta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. Blanc asks her to assist his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence.\n\nHarlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta, to her astonishment as well as the family's. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom persuades Marta to confess to him and offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother as an [[undocumented immigrant]].\n\nMarta receives an anonymous blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's [[toxicology]] report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the destroyed medical examiner's office, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief [[car chase]], the police arrest Ransom; Blanc explains to Marta that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room on the night of his death.\n\nMarta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged, along with her missing medical case. Marta hesitates, realizing that Fran can link her to the crime, but performs [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Fran and calls 911. Marta confesses to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's [[cannabis]] stash. Marta is about to confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death, but Blanc interrupts her after reading the report.\n\nBlanc reveals his deductions to Marta, Ransom, and the police: After Ransom learned at the party that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the [[slayer rule]]. However, Marta actually administered the correct medicine without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the blackmail note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder.\n\nMarta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses and vows revenge, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and he is taken into custody as Marta watches the Thrombeys depart from what is now her mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Benoit Blanc: A world-famous private detective\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Hugh Ransom Drysdale: Harlan's grandson (Linda and Richard's son), a spoiled playboy\n* [[Ana de Armas]] as Marta Cabrera: Harlan's nurse and close friend\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Linda Drysdale: Harlan's eldest daughter, a real estate mogul\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Walter \"Walt\" Thrombey: Harlan's youngest son, Harlan's publishing company CEO\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Richard Drysdale: Harlan's son-in-law (Linda's husband)\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Joni Thrombey: Harlan's daughter-in-law (widow of Neil), a [[lifestyle guru]]\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Detective Lieutenant Elliot: A local detective\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as Megan \"Meg\" Thrombey: Harlan's granddaughter (Joni and Neil's daughter), a liberal student\n* [[Jaeden Martell]] as Jacob Thrombey: Harlan's grandson (Walt and Donna's son), an alt-right youth\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Harlan Thrombey: A wealthy mystery novelist found dead after his 85th birthday party.

The [[concrete]] [[beam bridge]] is located  {{convert|9|km}} northwest of the [[Sydney central business district]] and connects [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] to [[North Ryde, New South Wales|North Ryde]] as part of the [[A38 (Sydney)|A38]].\n\nThe main entrance to [[Lane Cove National Park]] is located adjacent to the western end of Fullers Bridge.\n\n==Description==\nCompleted in 1918, Fullers Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]] structure, with four longitudinal deck beams on an over-vertical curve or camber. The beams have [[soffit]]s which are parallel with the deck over most of their length, but curve down to the piers. The piers consist of two columns each supported by timber piles with pilecaps. The pier columns have a square core cross section with large chamfers, giving an octagonal appearance, with four tapered thickenings or buttresses. The deep headstock connecting the columns supports the four deck beams. The deck is continuous from one abutment to the other. On the upstream side of the deck a timber walkway has been installed, supported by steel cantilever beams connected under the edge of the deck. The original pipe handrails have been replaced by guardrailing. The bridge also supports utility pipes on its downstream side.<ref name=rmsheritage/>\n\n==History==\nFullers Bridge is named after the Fuller family which operated a farm on the small area of agriculturally usable land which existed on the river banks at that location, in the late 19th century.\n\nUp until the early 1980s a kiosk and general store existed on the northern side of the bridge, and was accessible from both sides of the river by the northern pedestrian footbridge.\n\nFullers Bridge played a part in a famous Australian mystery, with the bodies of [[Bogle-Chandler case|Dr Gilbert Bogle and Mrs Margaret Chandler]] discovered on the banks of the Lane Cove River on 1 January 1963, {{convert|70|m}} south of the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Russell|title=Bogle & Chandler: The Discovery of the Bodies|work=boglechandler.com/|publisher=Russell Brown|date=1998-07-07|url=http://www.boglechandler.com/bcFBDiscoveryOfTheBodies.html|accessdate=2007-08-21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118102119/http://www.boglechandler.com/bcFBDiscoveryOfTheBodies.html|archive-date=18 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Heritage significance==\n{{quotation|''Fullers Bridge has local historic significance as a long anticipated element of public infrastructure shaping the history of the Willoughby and Lane Cove areas by providing permanent access across the Lane Cove River when road routes linking these areas were few and far between.
