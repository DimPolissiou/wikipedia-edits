Having perfected and tested the formula, he sends out messenger bats to summon all monsters to the Isle of Evil in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The Baron intends to inform them of his discovery and also to reveal his imminent retirement as head of the \"Worldwide Organization of Monsters\". Besides [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]] (sometimes referred to as \"Fang\") and the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Monster's more intelligent mate]] (voiced by [[Phyllis Diller]]) who live in the isle's castle with Boris, the invites also include [[Count Dracula]], the [[Mummy (undead)|Mummy]], [[Quasimodo]] (referred to as \"[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\"), the [[Werewolf]], [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]], [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and the [[Gill-man|Creature from the Black Lagoon]] (referred to as just \"The Creature\").\n\nThe Baron's beautiful assistant Francesca (voiced by [[Gale Garnett]]) enters the lab to confirm that all invitations have been delivered and inquires about one of the addressees named Felix Flanken (voiced by [[Allen Swift]] impersonating [[James Stewart]]). Frankenstein explains that Flanken is his nephew and successor in the monster business. This displeases Francesca, who covets the role for herself. Francesca even asks why there was not an invitation for \"It\". Boris replies that \"It\" was not invited since \"It\" can be a crushing bore, explaining that \"It\" even crushed the island's [[wild boar]]s in his bare hands the last time \"It\" was invited.\n\nFrankenstein has his zombie butler, Yetch (Swift impersonating [[Peter Lorre]]), Chef Mafia Machiavelli, and the zombie bellhops and servants make preparations for the upcoming party while having some zombies patrol the Isle of Evil to make sure that \"It\" does not show up uninvited. The monsters begin to arrive on the freighter that Felix is also traveling on.\n\nHowever, when Felix proves to be an incompetent, asthmatic (and unsuitably kind-hearted) human, the monsters plot to eliminate him and gain control of the secret formula. Over time, Francesca develops feelings for Felix after he unknowingly saves her multiple times. As Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Monster's Mate descend upon Francesca, she sends out a letter (via messenger bat) to an unknown recipient. When the monsters corner Felix upon capturing Francesca, they are frightened at the arrival of \"It\" (revealed to be a giant [[gorilla]] and a take-off of [[King Kong]]) who proceeds to go on a rampage since he was not invited. \"It\" snatches up the monsters and Francesca (on whom \"It\" develops a crush).\n\nFelix rushes off to tell his Uncle Boris what happened and is instructed to head to the boat. Boris leads the zombies in rescuing Francesca from \"It\" using biplanes. Boris convinces \"It\" to let Francesca go and to take him instead. \"It\" complies, releasing Francesca. Felix and Francesca manage to get off the island as Boris and the remainder of the monsters remain in the clutches of \"It\". Displeased that the monsters tried to steal the secret of total destruction for themselves and attempted to kill Felix as well as having to put up with \"It\", Boris sacrifices his life by dropping the vial containing the formula, destroying the Isle of Evil and everything on it.\n\nThe destruction is witnessed offshore by Felix and Francesca. Francesca tearfully admits to Felix that she is not human, but is in fact a robot creation of Boris von Frankenstein. Felix answers that \"none of us are perfect\" where he then mechanically repeats the words \"are perfect\", indicating that he has also been a robot creation of his uncle the entire time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Victor Frankenstein|Baron Boris von Frankenstein]]\n* [[Allen Swift|Alan Swift]] as Felix Flanken\n** Swift also provided the voice of primary characters: [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster \"Fang\"]], [[Werewolf]], [[Quasimodo|Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Invisible Man]], [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and [[King Kong|\"It\"]], in addition to supporting characters: Yetch, Skeleton, Chef Mafia Machiavelli, Mr. Kronkite, Freighter Captain, First Mate, and the Mailman.\n* [[Gale Garnett]] as Francesca\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] as [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|the Monster's mate / Bride of Frankenstein]]\n* [[Ethel Ennis]] as Title Song Singer\n\n==Crew==\n* Directed by [[Jules Bass]]\n* Produced by [[Arthur Rankin Jr.]]\n* Executive Producer: [[Joseph E.

The process involved photographing figurines a frame at a time, then re-positioning them, exposing another frame, and so forth.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In addition to Mochinaga, along with assistant director Kizo Nagashima, many other \"Animagic\" technicians of MOM (re-established as Video Tokyo Production after Mochinaga left for China) including puppet makers Ichiro Komuro and Kyoko Kita, and assistant animators Hiroshi Tabata and Fumiko Magari{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} also worked on the film for Rankin/Bass, but are uncredited.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Known as stop-motion animation, it was the same approach used in [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]'s ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', [[Art Clokey]]'s ''[[Gumby]]'' and ''[[Davey and Goliath]]'', and many other films, commercials and TV specials. In partnership with MOM and [[Dentsu]], Rankin/Bass had created several \"Animagic\" productions, including the syndicated television series ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the enormously successful Christmas television special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' and their first full-length film ''[[Willy McBean and his Magic Machine]]''. Classic monster films were enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the late 1960s, along with more comedy-centered examples, ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]''. This [[camp (style)|campy]] film is a spoof of horror themes, complete with [[musical film|musical numbers]] and [[in-joke|inside jokes]].\n\n''[[Mad Magazine]]'' creator [[Harvey Kurtzman]] penned the script (with writer Len Korobkin) and ''Mad'' artist [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] designed many of the characters. Davis was a natural for the job, being famous both for his humor work and his monster stories in the pages of [[EC Comics]]. It has long been rumored that [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] had a hand in the script, but while the dialogue is rife with ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''-like puns, Ackerman's involvement has never been confirmed and his name never appeared in the on-screen credits or in original promotion for the film at the time of its release. In fact, Rankin/Bass historian Rick Goldschmidt, in liner notes accompanying the Anchor Bay DVD release, denied Ackerman was ever involved, at the same time as the DVD packaging promoted Ackerman's name. Goldschmidt repeated his claims on this in a 2006 blog entry, based on his interviews with Korobkin, who claimed to have written the original screenplay, which then was revised by Kurtzman, but never worked with Ackerman.<ref>Rick Goldschmidt's Blogspot site.

Retrieved December 11, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the famous monsters seen in the film, ''Mad Monster Party?'' also features several celebrity likenesses. Karloff and Diller's characters are both designed to look like the actors portraying them, while Baron Frankenstein's lackey, Yetch, is a physical and vocal caricature of [[Peter Lorre]]. Swift also performs impersonations when voicing his characters, such as [[James Stewart]] when voicing Felix, [[Sydney Greenstreet]] as the Invisible Man and [[Charles Laughton]] as the Freighter Captain.\n\n''Mad Monster Party?'' was one of several family-friendly projects Karloff lent his voice to in his final years (including the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|1966 television adaptation]] of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''). It was his final involvement in a production connected to the Frankenstein mythos that had propelled him to stardom some three decades earlier.\n\n==Music==\n[[Image:Mad Monster Party cd cover.jpg|thumb|right|175px|CD cover]]\nAlthough the opening credits identify [[Ethel Ennis]] as singing the opening theme song and, in the same frame, a soundtrack being available on [[RCA Victor]], a commercially released soundtrack was never produced in any format. In September 1998, Percepto released a CD of the soundtrack for the film. \"The Mummy\" is allegedly performed by [[Dyke and the Blazers]].

Currently, [[Lionsgate]] distributes the film on video under license from StudioCanal.\n\nBefore Lionsgate's current video release of ''Mad Monster Party?'', almost all video releases have been from 16&nbsp;mm film and were of very poor color quality. The original film negative was water-damaged some years ago, but  [[Sony Pictures Television]] (which now holds the television rights) eventually unearthed an original 35&nbsp;mm pristine print. This print was digitally remastered, and is the source for the current DVD issue and all subsequent television showings. Anchor Bay released the previous DVD on August 19, 2003, then re-released it on August 23, 2005 with additional features. On September 8, 2009, it was released as a \"Special Edition\" DVD by Lionsgate. The special features include a documentary including interviews with Rick Goldschmidt, Arthur Rankin Jr., voice artist Allen Swift, storyboard artist Don Duga, musical director Maury Laws and others. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 4, 2012.\n\n===Comic book adaptation===\n* [[Dell Comics|Dell]] Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party'' (September 1967)<ref>{{gcdb series|id=74202|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party''}}</ref><ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=231995|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party''}}</ref>\n\n==Related film==\nRankin/Bass produced a \"[[prequel]] of sorts\": a TV special called ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters|Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters]]'' from ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]'' series, which aired on September 23, 1972. This Halloween special featured many of the same monster characters. [[Bob McFadden]] did his imitation of Karloff when voicing Baron Henry von Frankenstein (who resembles Baron Boris von Frankenstein). The animation for the special is provided by [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s [[Mushi Production]] with supervision by Steve Nakagawa, who was also known for his work with [[Iwao Takamoto]] at [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Studios]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Boris Karloff filmography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0061931}}\n* {{bcdb title|20506}}\n* {{allrovi movie|30662}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|mad_monster_party}}\n* [http://www.madmonsterparty.com ''Mad Monster Party'' unofficial site]\n* [http://www.rankinbass.com/mmphome.html Rankin-Bass ''Mad Monster Party'' site]\n\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{Rankin-Bass}}\n{{Dracula}}\n{{Frankenstein}}\n{{The Wolf Man}}\n{{The Mummy}}\n{{The Invisible Man}}\n{{Gill-man}}\n{{Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde}}\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n{{KingKong}}\n{{Universal Monsters}}\n{{Harvey Kurtzman navbox}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mad Monster Party}}\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1967 animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Crossover films]]\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Films set on islands]]\n[[Category:Frankenstein films]]\n[[Category:1960s monster movies]]\n[[Category:Mummy films]]\n[[Category:1960s stop-motion animated films]]\n[[Category:Werewolves in film]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Maury Laws]]\n[[Category:Television programs directed by Jules Bass]]\n[[Category:Rankin/Bass Productions films]]\n[[Category:American musical films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n[[Category:Vampires in animated film]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1967 film}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Mad Monster Party?\n| image          = POSTER - MAD MONSTER PARTY.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster by [[Frank Frazetta]]\n| director       = [[Jules Bass]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/473649/Mad-Monster-Party/credits|title=Mad Monster Party (1968)|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n| producer       = [[Arthur Rankin Jr.]]\n| screenplay     = {{plainlist|\n* Len Korobkin\n* [[Harvey Kurtzman]]\n}}\n| story          = Arthur Rankin Jr.\n| starring       = {{plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->\n* [[Boris Karloff]]\n* [[Phyllis Diller]]\n* [[Ethel Ennis]]\n* [[Gale Garnett]]\n}}\n| music          = {{plainlist|\n* [[Maury Laws]]\n* Jules Bass\n}}\n| cinematography = [[Tadahito Mochinaga]]\n| studio         = [[Rankin/Bass Productions]]<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DEFDC1E30EE3BBC4053DFB5668382679EDE|title=Mad Monster Party (1968)|last=Thompson|first=Howard|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 9, 1969|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n| distributor    = [[Embassy Pictures]]\n| released       = {{Film date|1967|3|8|United States}}\n| runtime        = 95 minutes\n| country        = United States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/473649/Mad-Monster-Party/overview|title=Mad Monster Party (1968)|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n| language       = English\n}}\n'''''Mad Monster Party?''''' is a 1967 American [[stop motion|stop-motion]] [[Animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] for [[Embassy Pictures]].<ref name=\"karloff\">Stephen Jacobs, ''Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster'', Tomohawk Press 2011 p 474-475</ref> The film stars [[Boris Karloff]], [[Allen Swift]], [[Gale Garnett]], and [[Phyllis Diller]].

This print was digitally remastered, and is the source for the current DVD issue and all subsequent television showings. Anchor Bay released the previous DVD on August 19, 2003, then re-released it on August 23, 2005 with additional features. On September 8, 2009, it was released as a \"Special Edition\" DVD by Lionsgate.

With a distinct vocal range, songwriting and producing talent, B\u00e1rbara has defined the modern [[Grupero]] performance and is one of the few regional Mexican acts to garner an international following that extends beyond M\u00e9xico and the United States.\n\nIn the past two decades, B\u00e1rbara has released eleven [[studio albums]], eighteen [[compilation album]]s, over thirty music videos, and four music video DVDs.

She was particularly influenced and inspired by her older sister, Viviana Ugalde, who was a popular singer locally. Today, Ugalde represents B\u00e1rbara as part of her management team.<ref name=\"tvazteca.com\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pkMZQ80bc Ana B\u00e1rbara \u2013 Historias engarzadas]. tvazteca.com.

She also earned the ''El Rostro Bonito de El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico'' (\"The Heraldo's Beautiful Face\") award. As a result, she was invited to perform for [[Pope John Paul II]] during a Mass at The Vatican. When Mass neared its close; however, she still hadn't been given an opportunity to sing, so she interrupted the proceedings, commanded the attention of the Pope, and began to sing. After mass [[Pope John Paul II]] approached her, blessed her, and wished her luck in her career.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In 1994, she was noticed by record executives from [[Fonovisa]], one of the top labels in the [[regional Mexican]] market. After signing with Fonovisa, she created artistic stage name \"Ana B\u00e1rbara\" and launched her self-titled debut album ''[[Ana B\u00e1rbara (Ana B\u00e1rbara album)|Ana B\u00e1rbara]]''. The album was produced and largely written by An\u00edbal Pastor; it also included songwriting from fellow Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]]. Songs like ''Sac\u00fademe'' and ''Nada'' helped B\u00e1rbara establish herself as a Grupero star.<ref>[http://www.fonovisa.com Fonovisa]. Fonovisa. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> B\u00e1rbara released her second album titled ''[[La Trampa (Ana B\u00e1rbara album)|La Trampa]]'' in July 1995, also produced by An\u00edbal Pastor. ''La Trampa'' catapulted her popularity and immediately became a commercial and radio hit. B\u00e1rbara received industry accolades as well as invitations to tour and open for some of the biggest regional Mexican artists, such as [[Vicente Fernandez]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]]. She has appeared on important Latin American television shows such as ''[[Sabado Gigante]]'' and ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]''. Consecutive hits and popular music videos, such as ''Me Asusta Pero Me Gusta'' and ''La Trampa'', topped [[Hot Latin Tracks|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks]] and established her as ''La Reina Grupera'' (The Queen of Grupero Music).\n\n===International stardom===\nBy the summer of 1996, B\u00e1rbara broke through to mainstream international success with third album ''Ay, Amor''. The album solidified her as a successful Latin recording artist and also became her best album debut on the Latin ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual\">[http://www.laopinion.com/ana-barbara-baila-sensual-fans Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual]. Terra.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> ''Ay, Amor'' offered a wider appeal to her music by offering some alternate takes on Grupero, and even some ranchero flavored ballads like ''No Ha Sido Facil'', and ''Entre Ella y Yo''.<ref name=\"Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual\"/> Her attractive appearance and sensual dancing style captivated [[Latin America]] audiences during promotional tours with hit singles and music videos of ''No Llorar\u00e9'' and ''Ya No Te Creo Nada''. In 1997 she released her first and only calendar. ''[[Coors Light]]'' beer also selected B\u00e1rbara as their Hispanic promotional figure for marketing and advertising. Later that year she returned to [[Miami]], Florida for the annual ''Calle 8 Music Festival'' where she was crowned \"Queen\" of the 1997 parade. In 1998, she released her fourth studio album produced by Mexican singer-songwriter [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]]. The album, titled ''Los Besos No Se Dan En La Camisa'', was largely a ballads album with only one Grupero-style song. It included a duet and background vocals by Sol\u00eds, as well as a 1982 [[Los Bukis]] cover of \"Como Me Haces Falta\", which quickly became a popular hit. The song also dominated airwaves across [[Latin America]], [[M\u00e9xico]], and the [[United States]]. Ana B\u00e1rbara kept up the momentum of her previous release as her popularity continued to grow. In 1999, she released fifth studio album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' produced by An\u00edbal Pastor.  One of his two songwriting credits, \"Enga\u00f1ada\", became the album's lead single and most popular hit. ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n'' was also notable in songwriting terms because it marked Ana B\u00e1rbara's debut as a songwriter.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In the same year she also debuted as an actress, starring in the made-for-TV film ''Todo Contigo,'' via Hispanic networks [[Televisa]] and [[Univision]]. The film's song \"Todo Contigo\" was included in album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n.'' Music videos like \"Quise Olvidar\" grew in popularity on television shows like ''Onda Max'' and other [[music video]] television networks. The following year B\u00e1rbara became the first solo grupero act recognized by The [[Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences]] for album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' which received a Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Grupero Album|Best Grupero Album]].\n\nIn 2000, B\u00e1rbara took a short maternity leave when her first child, Emiliano, was born. She returned in 2001 with her sixth studio album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia.'' The Mariachi-ballad effort was a challenge to her custom Grupero style; however, industry critics who had written off B\u00e1rbara as simply \"a grupero novelty built chiefly upon sex appeal\" consequently took her and her music a bit more seriously. In the fall, she received her second Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album|Best Ranchero Album]]. She  participated in \"[[El \u00daltimo Adi\u00f3s]] (The Last Goodbye)\", a song written in memory of the [[9/11]] attacks, which included other artists, such as [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]], [[Thal\u00eda]], and [[Ricky Martin]], among others. As B\u00e1rbara promoted her album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia'', she began preparations for a Grupero-style album.<ref name=AllMusicBio/>\n\nAfter several years as a recording artist, B\u00e1rbara began to produce her own material. She took control of the direction of her music and began to compose, arrange, and select her own lyrics and melodies, yet followed patterns of earlier albums.\n\nIn September 2003, ''Te Atrapar\u00e9...Bandido'' was released; it became one of her most successful albums to date. Soon record executives pushed for a follow-up album, and in May 2005 she produced and released ''Loca de Amar''.  She continued booking success with popular chart-topping singles like ''Bandido'', ''Deja'', ''Loca'', and ''Lo Busqu\u00e9'', which dominated airwaves across South America, Mexico, and the United States, as well as on ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks.\n\n===Selena tribute concert===\nIn April 2005, she participated in ''[[Selena \u00a1VIVE!]]'', an anniversary tribute concert held in honor of Latin music icon [[Selena]]. The star-studded event was held on April 7, 2005 at [[Reliant Stadium]] in Houston, Texas and included mainstream acts, such as [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Ana Gabriel]], [[Alejandra Guzman]], [[Olga Tanon]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], and [[Banda el Recodo]], among others. The iconic tribute was produced by Spanish-language network [[Univision]], and made history by becoming the most watched Spanish-language television special in the US. B\u00e1rbara produced and co-wrote a new version of \"[[La Carcacha]]\", which mixed Selena's original version with her Grupero signature style.\n\n===2005 Latin Grammy recognition===\n[[File:Ana B\u00e1rbara 2005.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ana B\u00e1rbara in the z\u00f3calo of Cholula, [[Puebla]] in 2005.

She also earned the ''El Rostro Bonito de El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico'' (\"The Heraldo's Beautiful Face\") award. As a result, she was invited to perform for [[Pope John Paul II]] during a Mass at The Vatican. When Mass neared its close; however, she still hadn't been given an opportunity to sing, so she interrupted the proceedings, commanded the attention of the Pope, and began to sing. After mass [[Pope John Paul II]] approached her, blessed her, and wished her luck in her career.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In 1994, she was noticed by record executives from [[Fonovisa]], one of the top labels in the [[regional Mexican]] market. After signing with Fonovisa, she created artistic stage name \"Ana B\u00e1rbara\" and launched her self-titled debut album ''[[Ana B\u00e1rbara (Ana B\u00e1rbara album)|Ana B\u00e1rbara]]''. The album was produced and largely written by An\u00edbal Pastor; it also included songwriting from fellow Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]]. Songs like ''Sac\u00fademe'' and ''Nada'' helped B\u00e1rbara establish herself as a Grupero star.<ref>[http://www.fonovisa.com Fonovisa]. Fonovisa.

''La Trampa'' catapulted her popularity and immediately became a commercial and radio hit. B\u00e1rbara received industry accolades as well as invitations to tour and open for some of the biggest regional Mexican artists, such as [[Vicente Fernandez]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]]. She has appeared on important Latin American television shows such as ''[[Sabado Gigante]]'' and ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]''. Consecutive hits and popular music videos, such as ''Me Asusta Pero Me Gusta'' and ''La Trampa'', topped [[Hot Latin Tracks|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks]] and established her as ''La Reina Grupera'' (The Queen of Grupero Music).\n\n===International stardom===\nBy the summer of 1996, B\u00e1rbara broke through to mainstream international success with third album ''Ay, Amor''. The album solidified her as a successful Latin recording artist and also became her best album debut on the Latin ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual\">[http://www.laopinion.com/ana-barbara-baila-sensual-fans Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual].

In 1997 she released her first and only calendar. ''[[Coors Light]]'' beer also selected B\u00e1rbara as their Hispanic promotional figure for marketing and advertising. Later that year she returned to [[Miami]], Florida for the annual ''Calle 8 Music Festival'' where she was crowned \"Queen\" of the 1997 parade. In 1998, she released her fourth studio album produced by Mexican singer-songwriter [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]]. The album, titled ''Los Besos No Se Dan En La Camisa'', was largely a ballads album with only one Grupero-style song. It included a duet and background vocals by Sol\u00eds, as well as a 1982 [[Los Bukis]] cover of \"Como Me Haces Falta\", which quickly became a popular hit. The song also dominated airwaves across [[Latin America]], [[M\u00e9xico]], and the [[United States]]. Ana B\u00e1rbara kept up the momentum of her previous release as her popularity continued to grow. In 1999, she released fifth studio album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' produced by An\u00edbal Pastor.  One of his two songwriting credits, \"Enga\u00f1ada\", became the album's lead single and most popular hit. ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n'' was also notable in songwriting terms because it marked Ana B\u00e1rbara's debut as a songwriter.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In the same year she also debuted as an actress, starring in the made-for-TV film ''Todo Contigo,'' via Hispanic networks [[Televisa]] and [[Univision]]. The film's song \"Todo Contigo\" was included in album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n.'' Music videos like \"Quise Olvidar\" grew in popularity on television shows like ''Onda Max'' and other [[music video]] television networks. The following year B\u00e1rbara became the first solo grupero act recognized by The [[Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences]] for album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' which received a Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Grupero Album|Best Grupero Album]].\n\nIn 2000, B\u00e1rbara took a short maternity leave when her first child, Emiliano, was born. She returned in 2001 with her sixth studio album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia.'' The Mariachi-ballad effort was a challenge to her custom Grupero style; however, industry critics who had written off B\u00e1rbara as simply \"a grupero novelty built chiefly upon sex appeal\" consequently took her and her music a bit more seriously. In the fall, she received her second Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album|Best Ranchero Album]]. She  participated in \"[[El \u00daltimo Adi\u00f3s]] (The Last Goodbye)\", a song written in memory of the [[9/11]] attacks, which included other artists, such as [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]], [[Thal\u00eda]], and [[Ricky Martin]], among others.

She took control of the direction of her music and began to compose, arrange, and select her own lyrics and melodies, yet followed patterns of earlier albums.\n\nIn September 2003, ''Te Atrapar\u00e9...Bandido'' was released; it became one of her most successful albums to date. Soon record executives pushed for a follow-up album, and in May 2005 she produced and released ''Loca de Amar''.  She continued booking success with popular chart-topping singles like ''Bandido'', ''Deja'', ''Loca'', and ''Lo Busqu\u00e9'', which dominated airwaves across South America, Mexico, and the United States, as well as on ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks.\n\n===Selena tribute concert===\nIn April 2005, she participated in ''[[Selena \u00a1VIVE!]]'', an anniversary tribute concert held in honor of Latin music icon [[Selena]]. The star-studded event was held on April 7, 2005 at [[Reliant Stadium]] in Houston, Texas and included mainstream acts, such as [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Ana Gabriel]], [[Alejandra Guzman]], [[Olga Tanon]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], and [[Banda el Recodo]], among others. The iconic tribute was produced by Spanish-language network [[Univision]], and made history by becoming the most watched Spanish-language television special in the US.

A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD-kby0LiuEC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123|title=Stalag Wisconsin: Inside WW II Prisoner-of-war Camps|last=Cowley|first=Betty|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Badger Books Inc.|isbn=9781878569837|pages=120\u201325|language=en}}</ref> German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in [[Rockfield, Wisconsin]], (located in present-day [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]]) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County.

It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt.

A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

His career and life story have been documented in his 2013 autobiography ''Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat'', co-written with author/musician Michael E. Veal, who previously wrote a comprehensive biography of [[Fela Kuti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/Tony-Allen/|work=[[Duke University Press]]|title=Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs drummer and musical director of Fela Anikulapo Kuti's band Africa '70 from 1968 to 1979, Allen was one of the primary co-founders of the genre of [[Afrobeat]] music.

Allen was influenced by music his father listened to [[J\u00f9j\u00fa music|J\u00f9j\u00fa]], a popular [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] music from the 1940s, but also American jazz, and the growing [[highlife]] scene in Nigeria and Ghana. Allen worked hard to develop a unique voice on the drums, feverishly studying LPs and magazine articles by [[Max Roach]] and [[Art Blakey]], but also revolutionary Ghanaian drummer [[Guy Warren]] (later known as [[Kofi Ghanaba]] \u2013 who developed a highly sought-after sound that mixed tribal Ghanaian drumming with bop \u2013 working with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Max Roach]]).\n\nAllen was hired by [[Victor Olaiya|\"Sir\" Victor Olaiya]] to play [[claves]] with his highlife band, the Cool Cats. Allen was able to fill the drum set chair when the former Cool Cats drummer left the band. Allen later played with Agu Norris and the Heatwaves, the Nigerian Messengers, and the Melody Makers.\n\n==Fela and Africa '70==\nIn 1964, [[Fela Kuti]] invited Allen to audition for a jazz-highlife band he was forming. Kuti and Allen had played together as sidemen in the Lagos circuit. Fela complimented Allen's unique sound: \"How come you are the only guy in Nigeria who plays like this \u2013 jazz and highlife?\" Thus Allen became an original member of Kuti's \"Koola Lobitos\" highlife-jazz band.\n\nIn 1969, following a turbulent and educational trip to the United States, Fela and the newly renamed Africa '70 band developed a new militant African sound, mixing the heavy groove and universal appeal of soul with jazz, highlife, and the [[polyrhythm]]ic template of Yoruba conventions. Allen developed a novel style to complement Fela's new African groove that blended these disparate genres.\n\nAllen recounts how he and Fela wrote in 1970: \"Fela used to write out the parts for all the musicians in the band (Africa '70). I was the only one who originated the music I played. Fela would ask what type of rhythm I wanted to play.\u2026 You can tell a good drummer because we\u2026 have four limbs\u2026 and they are\u2026 playing different things\u2026 the patterns don't just come from Yoruba\u2026 [but] other parts of Nigeria and Africa.\"<ref>Graeme Ewens, ''Africa O-Ye!'', 1991.</ref>\n\nAllen recorded more than 30 albums with Fela and Africa '70. But by the late 1970s, dissension was growing in the ranks of Africa '70. Arguments over royalties/pay and recognition grew in intensity. As inventor of the rhythms that underpinned Afrobeat and musical director, Allen felt especially slighted. Fela stood his ground, stating that he would get the royalties for his songs. Fela did support Allen's three solo recordings: ''Jealousy'' ('75), ''Progress'' ('77), ''No Accommodation For Lagos'' ('79), but by 1979, Allen chose to leave Africa '70, taking many members with him. \"'What makes me decide it's time to go? It's \u2026 everything...and (his) carelessness...like he doesn't care, like he doesn't know ...he doesn't feel he's done anything (wrong). And with all the parasites around too.... there were 71 people on tour by now and only 30 working in the band....you got to ask why. Those guys were sapping Fela of his Force, of his Music.' So Tony moved on, once again in search of his own sound.\"\n\n==Afrobeat to Afrofunk==\nAllen formed his own group, recording ''No Discrimination'' in 1980, and performing in Lagos until emigrating to London in 1984. Later moving to Paris, Allen recorded with [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], [[Ray Lema]] and [[Manu Dibango]]. Allen recorded ''N.E.P.A.'' in 1985.\n\nPost-Fela, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing and fusing Afrobeat with [[electronica]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[R&B]], and [[Hip hop music|rap]]. Allen refers to this synthesis as ''afrofunk''.\n\nAllen returned with a much anticipated new project for his 13th release. Recorded live in Lagos, with a full-sized Afrobeat band, ''Lagos No Shaking'' (Lagos is OK) signified Allen's return to roots Afrobeat after forays into avant-garde electronica hybrids. ''Lagos No Shaking'' was released on 13 June 2006.\n\n==Current work==\nIn 2002, Allen appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot and Riot]]'' in tribute to [[Fela Kuti]]. Allen appeared alongside [[Res (singer)|Res]], [[Ray Lema]], [[Baaba Maal]], [[Positive Black Soul]] and [[Archie Shepp]] on a track entitled \"No Agreement.\"\n\nAllen played drums throughout the 2003 album ''Love Trap'' by [[Susheela Raman]] and has also performed with her live.\n\nIn 2004 Allen recorded with French electronic artist [[S\u00e9bastien Tellier]] on the album ''[[Politics (S\u00e9bastien Tellier album)|Politics]]'' including the hit song \"[[La Ritournelle]]\".\n\nIn 2006, Allen joined with [[Damon Albarn]], [[Paul Simonon]], and [[Simon Tong]] as drummer for [[The Good, the Bad & the Queen]].\n\nAllen plays drums on two tracks on the 2007 album ''5:55'' by [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]: \"5:55\" and \"Night-Time Intermission\", backed by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] and [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].\n\nHe also made an appearance playing the drums in the video for \"[[Once Upon a Time (Air song)|Once Upon a Time]]\" by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] in late 2007.\n\nHe has been a featured artist on [[Zap Mama]]'s albums ''Supermoon'' (2007) and ''ReCreation'' (2009), adding his voice to the tracks \"1000 Ways\" and \"African Diamond.\"\nAllen also contributed drums on \"People Dansa\", an afrobeat rhythm-fuelled track on the second album of the Brazilian singer Flavia Coelho, released in 2014.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNHZTAXLp5U \"FLAVIA COELHO - Les Musiciens du 2e Album 'Mundo Meu'\".]</ref>\n\nHis album entitled ''Secret Agent'' was released in June 2009 by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]].<ref>[http://musicfeeds.com.au/music/tony-allen/ Tony Allen \u2013 Feature \u2013 Musicfeeds.com.au].

His career and life story have been documented in his 2013 autobiography ''Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat'', co-written with author/musician Michael E. Veal, who previously wrote a comprehensive biography of [[Fela Kuti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/Tony-Allen/|work=[[Duke University Press]]|title=Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs drummer and musical director of Fela Anikulapo Kuti's band Africa '70 from 1968 to 1979, Allen was one of the primary co-founders of the genre of [[Afrobeat]] music. Fela once stated that, \"without Tony Allen, there would be no Afrobeat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tony-allen-the-veteran-afrobeat-drummer-is-shaking-his-sticks-as-hard-and-as-brilliantly-as-ever-770993.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Tony Allen: The veteran Afrobeat drummer is shaking his sticks as hard and as brilliantly as ever|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref> He has also been described by [[Brian Eno]] as \"perhaps the greatest drummer who has ever lived.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=27798|publisher=www.allaboutjazz.com|title=Steve Reid: Staying in the Rhythms|first=Ian|last=Patterson|date=24 December 2007|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nA self-taught musician, Allen began playing a drum kit at the age of 18, while working as an engineer for a Nigerian radio station. Allen was influenced by music his father listened to [[J\u00f9j\u00fa music|J\u00f9j\u00fa]], a popular [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] music from the 1940s, but also American jazz, and the growing [[highlife]] scene in Nigeria and Ghana. Allen worked hard to develop a unique voice on the drums, feverishly studying LPs and magazine articles by [[Max Roach]] and [[Art Blakey]], but also revolutionary Ghanaian drummer [[Guy Warren]] (later known as [[Kofi Ghanaba]] \u2013 who developed a highly sought-after sound that mixed tribal Ghanaian drumming with bop \u2013 working with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Max Roach]]).\n\nAllen was hired by [[Victor Olaiya|\"Sir\" Victor Olaiya]] to play [[claves]] with his highlife band, the Cool Cats. Allen was able to fill the drum set chair when the former Cool Cats drummer left the band. Allen later played with Agu Norris and the Heatwaves, the Nigerian Messengers, and the Melody Makers.\n\n==Fela and Africa '70==\nIn 1964, [[Fela Kuti]] invited Allen to audition for a jazz-highlife band he was forming. Kuti and Allen had played together as sidemen in the Lagos circuit. Fela complimented Allen's unique sound: \"How come you are the only guy in Nigeria who plays like this \u2013 jazz and highlife?\" Thus Allen became an original member of Kuti's \"Koola Lobitos\" highlife-jazz band.\n\nIn 1969, following a turbulent and educational trip to the United States, Fela and the newly renamed Africa '70 band developed a new militant African sound, mixing the heavy groove and universal appeal of soul with jazz, highlife, and the [[polyrhythm]]ic template of Yoruba conventions. Allen developed a novel style to complement Fela's new African groove that blended these disparate genres.\n\nAllen recounts how he and Fela wrote in 1970: \"Fela used to write out the parts for all the musicians in the band (Africa '70). I was the only one who originated the music I played. Fela would ask what type of rhythm I wanted to play.\u2026 You can tell a good drummer because we\u2026 have four limbs\u2026 and they are\u2026 playing different things\u2026 the patterns don't just come from Yoruba\u2026 [but] other parts of Nigeria and Africa.\"<ref>Graeme Ewens, ''Africa O-Ye!'', 1991.</ref>\n\nAllen recorded more than 30 albums with Fela and Africa '70. But by the late 1970s, dissension was growing in the ranks of Africa '70. Arguments over royalties/pay and recognition grew in intensity. As inventor of the rhythms that underpinned Afrobeat and musical director, Allen felt especially slighted. Fela stood his ground, stating that he would get the royalties for his songs. Fela did support Allen's three solo recordings: ''Jealousy'' ('75), ''Progress'' ('77), ''No Accommodation For Lagos'' ('79), but by 1979, Allen chose to leave Africa '70, taking many members with him. \"'What makes me decide it's time to go? It's \u2026 everything...and (his) carelessness...like he doesn't care, like he doesn't know ...he doesn't feel he's done anything (wrong). And with all the parasites around too.... there were 71 people on tour by now and only 30 working in the band....you got to ask why. Those guys were sapping Fela of his Force, of his Music.' So Tony moved on, once again in search of his own sound.\"\n\n==Afrobeat to Afrofunk==\nAllen formed his own group, recording ''No Discrimination'' in 1980, and performing in Lagos until emigrating to London in 1984. Later moving to Paris, Allen recorded with [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], [[Ray Lema]] and [[Manu Dibango]]. Allen recorded ''N.E.P.A.'' in 1985.\n\nPost-Fela, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing and fusing Afrobeat with [[electronica]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[R&B]], and [[Hip hop music|rap]]. Allen refers to this synthesis as ''afrofunk''.\n\nAllen returned with a much anticipated new project for his 13th release. Recorded live in Lagos, with a full-sized Afrobeat band, ''Lagos No Shaking'' (Lagos is OK) signified Allen's return to roots Afrobeat after forays into avant-garde electronica hybrids. ''Lagos No Shaking'' was released on 13 June 2006.\n\n==Current work==\nIn 2002, Allen appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot and Riot]]'' in tribute to [[Fela Kuti]]. Allen appeared alongside [[Res (singer)|Res]], [[Ray Lema]], [[Baaba Maal]], [[Positive Black Soul]] and [[Archie Shepp]] on a track entitled \"No Agreement.\"\n\nAllen played drums throughout the 2003 album ''Love Trap'' by [[Susheela Raman]] and has also performed with her live.\n\nIn 2004 Allen recorded with French electronic artist [[S\u00e9bastien Tellier]] on the album ''[[Politics (S\u00e9bastien Tellier album)|Politics]]'' including the hit song \"[[La Ritournelle]]\".\n\nIn 2006, Allen joined with [[Damon Albarn]], [[Paul Simonon]], and [[Simon Tong]] as drummer for [[The Good, the Bad & the Queen]].\n\nAllen plays drums on two tracks on the 2007 album ''5:55'' by [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]: \"5:55\" and \"Night-Time Intermission\", backed by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] and [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].\n\nHe also made an appearance playing the drums in the video for \"[[Once Upon a Time (Air song)|Once Upon a Time]]\" by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] in late 2007.\n\nHe has been a featured artist on [[Zap Mama]]'s albums ''Supermoon'' (2007) and ''ReCreation'' (2009), adding his voice to the tracks \"1000 Ways\" and \"African Diamond.\"\nAllen also contributed drums on \"People Dansa\", an afrobeat rhythm-fuelled track on the second album of the Brazilian singer Flavia Coelho, released in 2014.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNHZTAXLp5U \"FLAVIA COELHO - Les Musiciens du 2e Album 'Mundo Meu'\".]</ref>\n\nHis album entitled ''Secret Agent'' was released in June 2009 by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]].<ref>[http://musicfeeds.com.au/music/tony-allen/ Tony Allen \u2013 Feature \u2013 Musicfeeds.com.au].

'''Shunde''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in southern [[Hebei]] province, People's Republic of China. It has a total area of {{convert|12486|km2}} and administers 2 [[district of China|districts]], 2 [[county-level cities]] and 15 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]. At the 2010 census, its population was 7,104,103 inhabitants whom 1,461,809 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 2 urban districts and Xingtai and Nanhe Counties largely being conurbated now. It borders [[Shijiazhuang]] and [[Hengshui]] in the north, [[Handan]] in the south, and the provinces of [[Shandong]] and [[Shanxi]] in the east and west respectively.\n\n==History==\nXingtai is the oldest city in North China.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The history of Xingtai can be traced back 3500 years ago. During the [[Shang Dynasty]], Xingtai functioned as a [[capitals of China|capital city]]. During the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the [[Xing (state)|State of Xing]]{{spaced ndash}}from which the present name derives{{spaced ndash}}was founded in the city. During the [[Warring States period]], the [[state of Zhao]] made Xingtai its provisional capital. The city was known as '''Xindu''' for most of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but after the 207 BC [[Battle of Julu]] (within present-day [[Pingxiang County]], not today's [[Julu County]]), it became known as '''Xiangguo'''.

During the [[Shang Dynasty]], Xingtai functioned as a [[capitals of China|capital city]]. During the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the [[Xing (state)|State of Xing]]{{spaced ndash}}from which the present name derives{{spaced ndash}}was founded in the city. During the [[Warring States period]], the [[state of Zhao]] made Xingtai its provisional capital. The city was known as '''Xindu''' for most of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but after the 207 BC [[Battle of Julu]] (within present-day [[Pingxiang County]], not today's [[Julu County]]), it became known as '''Xiangguo'''. During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms Period]], when the [[Later Zhao]] was founded by [[Shi Le]] of the [[Jie people|Jie]], the capital was again at Xiangguo. During the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang dynasties]], the city was known as '''Xingzhou'''.\n\nSui, Tang and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] times saw the zenith of ceramics production in what was the most prolific ceramics center of northern China (rivaling the [[Yue ware]] from the South). The white ware and new technologies developed in the '''Xing Kiln''' mark the transition from proto-porcelain to proper '''[[porcelain]]'''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Xiaoyan|title=The Most Ancient White Porcelain in China|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/cs/201810/t20181011_800143922.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=China Today|date=October 11, 2018}}</ref> More than thirty kiln site have been excavated in different subdivisions of today's Xingtai City and a large high-tech museum have been established in Neiqiu County in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Xiaoyan|title=Significant Results from the Excavation of Xing Kiln Site in 2012|url=http://chinesearchaeology.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2013/1026/43164.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=Chinese Archaeology|date=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Xingyao Museum|url=http://www.shijiazhuanggd.com/mlxt/yzxt/fjms/jdjs/201902/t20190212_462194.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=Shijiazhuang Municipality Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Xing Kiln Museum / YCA|url=https://www.archdaily.com/917716/xing-kiln-museum-yca|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=ArchDaily|date=May 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing dynasties]], Xingtai was called '''Shunteh''' (''Shundefu'') and functioned as a prefecture in China.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nXingtai has a continental, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk''),<ref>Peel, M.

{"title_page": "New Economic Mechanism", "text_new": "The '''New Economic Mechanism (NEM)''' was a major [[economic reform]] launched in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] in 1968.

During the subsequent decade, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] ended the era, the NEM's principles continued to affect the [[economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]], even in cases where the \"NEM\" name was not emphasized. Because of the NEM, Hungary in the 1980s had a higher ratio of [[market mechanism]]s to [[central planning]] than any other Eastern Bloc economy. The ratio was different to an extent that was [[politics|politically]] challenging to bring about in the Soviet sphere because of the [[ideology|ideological]] mixture it required. The name [[Goulash Communism]] was jokingly (but tellingly) applied to this mixture. The Hungarian economy under the influence of NEM principles was widely viewed as outperforming other Eastern Bloc economies, making Hungary \"the happiest barrack\" in [[barracks communism]]. Many Soviet and [[Eastern European people]] enjoyed going to Hungary (for example, on work assignments or on vacations) because of the economic and cultural environment there.\n\nThe tensions and harmonies between market mechanisms and central planning, with neither having sole control, are a perennial challenge in all societies that temper capitalism with socialism or vice versa. In some ways Hungary's economic reform channels comparisons with the [[Chinese economic reform]], in the sense that both were qualitative challenges to a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] type of system\u2014and thus that such reforms were not politically feasible in most of the Eastern Bloc.\n\n== Reform ==\nThe period from 1956\u20131968 was one of reform in Eastern Europe. The beginning of these transformations was marked by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], which resulted in [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]]\u2019s placement as the communist leader of the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] and the creation of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (HSWP). For the first ten years of his rule, K\u00e1d\u00e1r\u2019s objective was to create a united Hungary, announcing in December 1961 that \"those who are not against us are with us.\" Having reached social peace, K\u00e1d\u00e1r turned his attention to economic improvement.\n\nOn 7 May 1966, the Central Committee of the HSWP announced K\u00e1d\u00e1r's plans for the reform of the economy, known as the New Economic Mechanism (NEM).<ref name = \"Belassa\">Balassa, Bela.

The NEM represented a move away from the soviet economic system of compulsory plan indicators in favor of a policy that states profits as the enterprise's main goal. The new economic policy was a \"comprehensive reform of the economic system\", creating market relationships among firms, using prices as allocative functions and firms responding to prices to maximize profits, and using profits to budget new investments.<ref name=\"Belassa\"/>\n\n== Enterprises ==\n\nThe Central Committee's document on 7 May 1966 details changes in the firm's role under the new economic policy. The reform gave producers the freedom to decide what and how much they produce and offer for sale and to establish commercial or co-operative relationships. Buyers were also given the freedom to choose between domestic goods and imports. Additionally, firms were given greater autonomy in carrying out investments and hiring labor. As dictated by the Central Committee, success is to be measured by a firm's profitability.<ref name=\"Belassa\"/> The decentralized structure of the New Economic Mechanism marked an improvement in the decision making process, allowing for basic decisions to be made at the local level without information having to be transmitted upward for a more centralized decision.<ref name=\"Granick\"/>  The Hungarian government made 50.5%(enterprises 49.5%) of the investment decisions for the 68 billion [[forint]] invested in 1968, while in 1974 enterprises accounted for 53.1% of the decisions for the 128 billion forint invested.<ref name = \"Das\">Das Gupta, K.K..

He is most recognized for being a key figure of the [[counterculture]] movement known as [[La Onda]] and the creator of the comic strip character ''Avandarito''.\n\n==Early years and studies ==\nBorn as Carlos Eduardo Baca Delgado in Mexico City, he was attracted to nature from early childhood, spending long hours in the famous [[Bosque de Chapultepec|Chapultepec Woods]]. From 1969 to 1979 he studied [[Yoga]] and [[vegetarianism]] at the [[Universal Great Brotherhood]]  becoming an international teacher and lecturer afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baca|first1=Carlos|title=Biografia|url=http://www.carlosbaca.mx/biografia.html|website=Carlos Baca|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523045657/http://www.carlosbaca.mx/biografia.html|archive-date=23 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Counterculture years: Communal life, ''Avandaro'' and ''La Onda'' ==\nIn 1968 he was invited to collaborate with the magazine ''M\u00e9xico Canta'' and by 1969 he was appointed its director. At the same time he was also hired as collaborator in the ''POP'' magazine, writing about philosophy and ecology and making memorable interviews to artists such as [[Juan Gabriel]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Love Army]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Joan Manuel Serrat]], [[Janis Joplin]] among others.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hernandez Chelico|first1=Javier|title=Carlos Baca y M\u00e9xico Canta|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/11/15/espectaculos/a12o1esp|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=La Jornada|publisher=UNAM|date=15 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hernandez Chelico|first1=Javier|title=Revistas, didactismos y rock|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/04/12/espectaculos/a11o1esp|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=La Jornada|publisher=UNAM|date=12 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Zolov|first1=Eric|title=Refried Elvis: The rise of the Mexican counterculture|date=July 1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=USA|isbn=9780520215146|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/refriedelvisrise0000zolo|accessdate=14 November 2014|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, together with other La Onda stars such as [[Mayita Campos]], [[Jos\u00e9 Roberto Hill]] and [[Margarita Bauche]], he funded the [[commune]] ''La Nueva Familia'' (The new family) in San Lorenzo Acopilco, outside Mexico City. The hippie commune was notable for its production of bread and cereals.\n\nIn September of the same year he went to the [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Av\u00e1ndaro|Avandaro Festival]] to make a reportage on site,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baca|first1=Carlos|title=La noche de Avandaro|journal=M\u00e9xico Canta|date=19 September 1971|volume=252|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> but since he was highly revered by the ''[[jipitecas]]'' and his La Onda peers, he was persuaded by [[Armando Molina]], the festival's appointed music coordinator, to inaugurate the festival with a yoga session and an ecology lecture.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Garcia Michel|first1=Hugo|title=Yo vi a la encuerada de Avandaro|url=http://www.drogasmexico.org/index.php?nota=4832|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=MILENIO|date=19 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marroquin|first1=Enrique|title=Dios quiere que llueva para unirnos.|journal=Piedra Rodante|date=30 October 1971|volume=1|issue=6|pages=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the festival he created the comic strip \"Aliviane a la Madre Tierra\" (Aid to Mother Earth) including its famous character \"Avandarito\" which was included as part of the POP magazine and was printed from 1971 to 1973.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jim\u00e9nez Izquierdo|first1=Juan|title=Avandaro: Una leyenda.|date=2011|publisher=ERIDU|location=Mexico|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n== Later years ==\nBy 1974 as the [[hippie movement]] waned world wide and the commune members dispersed each pursuing their own goals in their careers, Baca focused his attention to further his knowledge of nature studying in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]] and attending several seminars. He published his book ''Nutrici\u00f3n Natural al Alcance de Todos'' (Natural nutrition for all) in 1976, starting a notable career which expands 4 decades as a lecturer and writer of ecology, nutrition and environmental issues. He founded ''ALECOS'', a club destined to promote healthy lifestyles and [[alternative medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baca|first1=Carlos|title=Biografia|url=http://www.carlosbaca.mx/biografia.html|website=Carlos Baca|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523045657/http://www.carlosbaca.mx/biografia.html|archive-date=23 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nHis authoritative texts about the counterculture are still being re-published in new books on the subject.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ponce|first1=Roberto|title=Presentan el libro \"Rock en salsa verde\", de Jorge H.

The population was 10,602 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Lakeville town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor geographic and demographic information on the village of North Lakeville, please see the article [[North Lakeville, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lakeville MA Ancient House.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient House in Lakeville]]\nLakeville was settled in 1717 as a western parish of [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]].  It was incorporated as a separate town in 1853.  The town's name comes from the system of lakes in the town, including [[Assawompset Pond]], [[Great Quittacas Pond]], [[Little Quittacas Pond]], [[Pocksha Pond]], and [[Long Pond (Lakeville, Massachusetts)|Long Pond]].  Long Pond is the source of the [[Acushnet River]], and Assawompsett Pond is the source of the [[Nemasket River]], which feeds the [[Taunton River]]. [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] is headquartered in Lakeville.  Lakeville is also commonly referred to as \"The Promised Land.\"\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|93.6|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|76.6|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|17.0|km2|order=flip}}, or 18.17%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Kingston town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>  Lakeville is irregularly shaped, bordered by [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] to the northeast and east, [[Rochester, Massachusetts|Rochester]] to the southeast, [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] to the south and southwest, and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]] and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] to the west.  Its borders with Taunton, Berkley and Freetown are also a central section of the western borders of Plymouth County.  Lakeville is roughly at the center of what is considered Southeastern Massachusetts, and is approximately {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], {{convert|20|mi}} north of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], {{convert|30|mi}} east of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and {{convert|40|mi}} south of [[Boston]].\n\nThe town's geography is dominated by its namesake lakes, which are referred to as \"ponds\" in general usage.  In addition to the main bodies of water and their feeder brooks and rivers, there are also several smaller ponds, as well as many brooks and swamps, including the Casual Swamp and the Cedar Swamp, which is protected as a part of the Assonet Cedar Swamp Wildlife Management Area, which is operated by the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]].  There are also several small conservation areas, four country clubs and two parks, including the Ted Williams Camp, which was once the site of a summer baseball camp run by [[Ted Williams]]. According to \"Lakeville, Massachusetts Gravestone Inscriptions 1711-2003\" by Jean Douillette, there are 31 known cemeteries in Lakeville, or almost 1 per square mile.\n\nThe body of [[John Sassamon]], advisor to Governor [[Josiah Winslow]], was discovered beneath the ice of Assawompsett Pond. He was believed to have been murdered, and three Native Americans were arrested. On the testimony of only one witness (contrary to English law, which required the testimony of at least two witnesses in a murder trial), the three were sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. When the sentence was carried out, Tobias, senior counselor to the [[Pokanoket]] sachem [[Metacomet|King Philip]], and a second supposed accomplice died. When the attempt was made to carry out the sentence on the third \"accomplice\" - Tobias's son - the rope broke and he was imprisoned, having first confessed to the killings. His confession is widely believed to have been coerced.\n\nThe death of John Sassamon and the subsequent trial and execution of the Native Americans - while not the cause of [[King Philip's War]] and the bloodshed that followed - nonetheless probably contributed to the ardor of the participants.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA | state=collapsed\n | 1860|1160\n | 1870|1159\n | 1880|1008\n | 1890|935\n | 1900|958\n | 1910|1141\n | 1920|1419\n | 1930|1574\n | 1940|1780\n | 1950|2066\n | 1960|3209\n | 1970|4376\n | 1980|5931\n | 1990|7785\n | 2000|9821\n | 2010|10602\n | footnote=* = population estimate.

The town has its own police department and a single [[fire station]], located next to the town hall.  The \"new\" library is located behind the old town hall, just across Route 18 from its former location at the junction of Routes 18 and 105.  The town of Lakeville also has other services, such as a Council on Aging and a historical commission.\n\nOn the state level, Lakeville is represented in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a part of the Twelfth Bristol District.  The town is represented by Senator [[Michael J. Rodrigues]] (D-Westport), as a part of the First Bristol and Plymouth District, which also includes Fall River, Freetown, Rochester, Somerset, Swansea and Westport.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/legis/citytown.htm Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from Mass.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&L=5&L0=Home&L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&L2=Law+Enforcement&L3=State+Police+Troops&L4=Troop+D&sid=Eeops&b=terminalcontent&f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_d_msp_field_troop_d_station_d4&csid=Eeops Station D-4, SP Middleborough]</ref>\n\nOn the national level, Lakeville is a part of [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district]], and is currently represented by [[Joseph P.

The junior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class II]]) senator, elected in 2013, is [[Ed Markey]].\n\n==Education==\nSince 1959, Lakeville has shared its school department with Freetown, creating the Freetown - Lakeville Regional School District. Lakeville operates several schools for its school aged population.  [[Assawompsett Elementary School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grades K-3.  The [[George R. Austin Intermediate School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grade 4 and 5.  [[Freetown-Lakeville Middle School]] is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and [[Apponequet Regional High School]] is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12.  Apponequet's colors are navy, white, and red, their nickname is the \"Lakers,\" and their mascot was a [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] brave, but after a sensitivity issue among the faculty at Apponequet, it was changed to an \"A\".  The school, like several others in the region, used to use the spear logo made famous by [[Florida State University]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] for its athletics marks, but this was deemed to promote violence, so it was replaced with the \"A\".  Their teams compete in the South Coast Conference, and their chief rival is Old Rochester Regional High School in Mattapoisett.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Massachusetts Route 140]], a four-lane divided highway, passes through the town on its trip between [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] in nearby [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] and [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The town is also crossed by [[Massachusetts Route 18|Route 18]], [[Massachusetts Route 79|Route 79]] and [[Massachusetts Route 105|Route 105]], as well as a short, {{convert|0.4|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[U.S. Route 44]] in the far northern point of town.  Route 79's eastern terminus is at its intersection with Route 105 on the town line.  Additionally, three exits of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] are located just over the town line in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]], granting access to Routes 44, 18 and 105 (from north to south in order).\n\nIn addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville).  There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by [[CSX Transportation]].  This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to [[Cape Cod]] via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and New Bedford, respectively.

The population was 10,602 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Lakeville town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor geographic and demographic information on the village of North Lakeville, please see the article [[North Lakeville, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lakeville MA Ancient House.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient House in Lakeville]]\nLakeville was settled in 1717 as a western parish of [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]].  It was incorporated as a separate town in 1853.  The town's name comes from the system of lakes in the town, including [[Assawompset Pond]], [[Great Quittacas Pond]], [[Little Quittacas Pond]], [[Pocksha Pond]], and [[Long Pond (Lakeville, Massachusetts)|Long Pond]].  Long Pond is the source of the [[Acushnet River]], and Assawompsett Pond is the source of the [[Nemasket River]], which feeds the [[Taunton River]]. [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] is headquartered in Lakeville.  Lakeville is also commonly referred to as \"The Promised Land.\"\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|93.6|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|76.6|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|17.0|km2|order=flip}}, or 18.17%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Kingston town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>  Lakeville is irregularly shaped, bordered by [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] to the northeast and east, [[Rochester, Massachusetts|Rochester]] to the southeast, [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] to the south and southwest, and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]] and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] to the west.  Its borders with Taunton, Berkley and Freetown are also a central section of the western borders of Plymouth County.  Lakeville is roughly at the center of what is considered Southeastern Massachusetts, and is approximately {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], {{convert|20|mi}} north of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], {{convert|30|mi}} east of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and {{convert|40|mi}} south of [[Boston]].\n\nThe town's geography is dominated by its namesake lakes, which are referred to as \"ponds\" in general usage.  In addition to the main bodies of water and their feeder brooks and rivers, there are also several smaller ponds, as well as many brooks and swamps, including the Casual Swamp and the Cedar Swamp, which is protected as a part of the Assonet Cedar Swamp Wildlife Management Area, which is operated by the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]].  There are also several small conservation areas, four country clubs and two parks, including the Ted Williams Camp, which was once the site of a summer baseball camp run by [[Ted Williams]]. According to \"Lakeville, Massachusetts Gravestone Inscriptions 1711-2003\" by Jean Douillette, there are 31 known cemeteries in Lakeville, or almost 1 per square mile.\n\nThe body of [[John Sassamon]], advisor to Governor [[Josiah Winslow]], was discovered beneath the ice of Assawompsett Pond. He was believed to have been murdered, and three Native Americans were arrested. On the testimony of only one witness (contrary to English law, which required the testimony of at least two witnesses in a murder trial), the three were sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. When the sentence was carried out, Tobias, senior counselor to the [[Pokanoket]] sachem [[Metacomet|King Philip]], and a second supposed accomplice died. When the attempt was made to carry out the sentence on the third \"accomplice\" - Tobias's son - the rope broke and he was imprisoned, having first confessed to the killings. His confession is widely believed to have been coerced.\n\nThe death of John Sassamon and the subsequent trial and execution of the Native Americans - while not the cause of [[King Philip's War]] and the bloodshed that followed - nonetheless probably contributed to the ardor of the participants.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA | state=collapsed\n | 1860|1160\n | 1870|1159\n | 1880|1008\n | 1890|935\n | 1900|958\n | 1910|1141\n | 1920|1419\n | 1930|1574\n | 1940|1780\n | 1950|2066\n | 1960|3209\n | 1970|4376\n | 1980|5931\n | 1990|7785\n | 2000|9821\n | 2010|10602\n | footnote=* = population estimate.

The town has its own police department and a single [[fire station]], located next to the town hall.  The \"new\" library is located behind the old town hall, just across Route 18 from its former location at the junction of Routes 18 and 105.  The town of Lakeville also has other services, such as a Council on Aging and a historical commission.\n\nOn the state level, Lakeville is represented in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a part of the Twelfth Bristol District.  The town is represented by Senator [[Michael J. Rodrigues]] (D-Westport), as a part of the First Bristol and Plymouth District, which also includes Fall River, Freetown, Rochester, Somerset, Swansea and Westport.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/legis/citytown.htm Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from Mass.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&L=5&L0=Home&L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&L2=Law+Enforcement&L3=State+Police+Troops&L4=Troop+D&sid=Eeops&b=terminalcontent&f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_d_msp_field_troop_d_station_d4&csid=Eeops Station D-4, SP Middleborough]</ref>\n\nOn the national level, Lakeville is a part of [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district]], and is currently represented by [[Joseph P.

The junior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class II]]) senator, elected in 2013, is [[Ed Markey]].\n\n==Education==\nSince 1959, Lakeville has shared its school department with Freetown, creating the Freetown - Lakeville Regional School District. Lakeville operates several schools for its school aged population.  [[Assawompsett Elementary School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grades K-3.  The [[George R. Austin Intermediate School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grade 4 and 5.  [[Freetown-Lakeville Middle School]] is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and [[Apponequet Regional High School]] is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12.  Apponequet's colors are navy, white, and red, their nickname is the \"Lakers,\" and their mascot was a [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] brave, but after a sensitivity issue among one of the faculty at Apponequet, it was changed to an \"A\".  The school, like several others in the region, used to use the spear logo made famous by [[Florida State University]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] for its athletics marks, but this was deemed to promote violence, so it was replaced with the \"A\".  Their teams compete in the South Coast Conference, and their chief rival is Old Rochester Regional High School in Mattapoisett.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Massachusetts Route 140]], a four-lane divided highway, passes through the town on its trip between [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] in nearby [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] and [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The town is also crossed by [[Massachusetts Route 18|Route 18]], [[Massachusetts Route 79|Route 79]] and [[Massachusetts Route 105|Route 105]], as well as a short, {{convert|0.4|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[U.S. Route 44]] in the far northern point of town.  Route 79's eastern terminus is at its intersection with Route 105 on the town line.  Additionally, three exits of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] are located just over the town line in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]], granting access to Routes 44, 18 and 105 (from north to south in order).\n\nIn addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville).  There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by [[CSX Transportation]].  This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to [[Cape Cod]] via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and New Bedford, respectively.  The New Bedford line also passes through the town on its west side.  The town has no air facilities of its own.  The nearest private airfield is in Taunton; the nearest regional airport is in New Bedford, and the nearest national and international airport is [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Lakeville (Massachusetts)}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.lakevillema.org/ Town of Lakeville official website]\n* [http://www.lakevillelibrary.org/ Lakeville Public Library]\n* [http://www.wickedlocallakeville.com ''Lakeville Call''], local newspaper\n* Answer Book/Lakeville: [http://www.enterprisenews.com/lakeville/ \u201cEverything you need to know\u201d]\n* [http://www.hauntedlakeville.com/ A site about Lakeville's cemeteries]\n\n{{Plymouth County, Massachusetts}}\n{{Greater Boston}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Plymouth County, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Lakeville, Massachusetts|*Main]]\n[[Category:Towns in Massachusetts]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reword - you can't be \"among one\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeville,_Massachusetts"}
