He spent most of his career in the Italian [[Serie C1]] and [[Serie C2]], in the role of a backup [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Internazionale===\nBorn in 1973, in [[Monza]], which at the time was in the [[Province of Milan]] (now in the [[Province of Monza and Brianza]]), Nuzzo started his professional career at [[F.C. Internazionale Milano]], one of the major Italian clubs of the region, initially joining the team's youth side.\n\nSince the 1992 season, he spent his career on loan at various [[Serie C2]] clubs, as Internazionale had more experienced players as their second goalkeeper, such as [[Beniamino Abate]], [[Luca Mondini]], [[Marco Landucci]] and [[Andrea Mazzantini]]. He played 26 out of 34 league matches for [[A.S. Fasano|Fasano]], and his performances secured him a move to [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], a team with the aim of obtaining promotion to [[Serie C1]]. He played 2 matches for the Serie C2 runners-up, but the club failed to obtain promotion as they lost in the playoffs. The following season, he moved to [[A.S. Gualdo Calcio|Gualdo]] of [[Serie C1]], which had finished in fifth place the previous season. Due to the departure of [[Davide Torchia]] and [[Oscar Verderame]], he became one of the team's first choice keepers, along with the more experienced [[Marco Savorani]]. Although Gualdo finished just above the relegation zone, Nuzzo's performances earned him a place in Internazionale's first team, as third goalkeeper behind [[Andrea Mazzantini]], but ahead of the young youth products. He was on the bench for the second leg of the club's victorious [[1994 UEFA Cup Final]] ([[Beniamino Abate]] was on the bench for the first leg). In the [[1998\u201399 Serie A|1998\u201399 season]], Internazionale signed [[S\u00e9bastien Frey]], which led to Mazzantini's departure from the club in the January transfer window, while Nuzzo remained as the team's third-choice keeper. He played his only match in [[Serie A]] and for Internazionale on the last matchday of the Serie A season, on 23 May 1999, when he came on as a substitute for starting goalkeeper [[Gianluca Pagliuca]] in the last minute of Inter's match against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]], with the score 2\u20131; the match ended in a 3\u20131 victory for Inter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfc.it/Scheda.asp?id=150|title=Raffaele NUZZO|publisher=Inter F.C.|language=Italian|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1999, Nuzzo left for [[FA Premier League]] side [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on loan, along with [[Antonio Caruso]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-kharine-moves-to-celtic-1101935.html|title=Football: Kharine moves to Celtic|publisher=[[The Independent]] | location=London | first=Kieran | last=Daley|date=23 June 1999|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref> Following [[Steve Ogrizovic]]'s recovery from injury, who was originally the team's second goalkeeper, Nuzzo was sent back to Internazionale in November.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-fulham-close-to-completing-hughes-deal-1127252.html|title=Football: Fulham close to completing Hughes deal|publisher=[[The Independent]] | location=London | first=Alan | last=Nixon|date=19 November 1999|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref> His only Coventry appearance was one to forget.

It was directed by [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] and [[Brenda Chapman]] and co-directed by [[Steve Purcell]]. The story is by Chapman, with the screenplay by Andrews, Purcell, Chapman and [[Irene Mecchi]]. The film was produced by [[Katherine Sarafian]], with [[John Lasseter]], [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]] as executive producers. The film's voice cast features [[Kelly Macdonald]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Kevin McKidd]], and [[Craig Ferguson]]. Set in the [[Scottish Highlands]], the film tells the story of a princess named [[Merida (Disney)|Merida]] who defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in the kingdom by expressing the desire not to be betrothed. Merida is the first, and currently, only Disney princess created by Pixar. The film is also dedicated to [[Steve Jobs]], who died before the film's release.\n\nChapman drew inspiration for the film's story from her relationship with her own daughter.

While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.\n\nTen years later, Merida, now a big sister to identical triplets\u2014Harris, Hubert, and Hamish, discovers that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.\n\nThe allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans, and after a heated argument with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch. Merida bargains for a spell to change her fate, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.\n\nWhen Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to \"mend the bond torn by pride\" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.\n\nThey return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.\n\nMerida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unable to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her brothers, who have also eaten the enchanted cake. They are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the [[spirit]] of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects.\n\nWith Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.\n<!-- NOTE: Please do not add the post-credits scene to the plot summary.

The orchestra was conducted by [[James Shearman]]. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as [[bagpipes]], a solo [[fiddle]], [[Cl\u00e0rsach|Celtic harps]], flutes and the [[bodhr\u00e1n]], with an electronically treated [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and [[cimbalom]] to give it a more contemporary feel.  \"I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as [[Reel (dance)|reels]], [[jig]]s, and [[Strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which not only serve the action but keep it authentic,\" said Doyle.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite press release|title=Sounds Of The Highlands; Disney-Pixar's \"Brave\" Transports Moviegoers to Ancient Scotland with Oscar-Nominated Composer Patrick Doyle, Plus Performers Julie Fowlis and Birdy (with Mumford & Sons)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sounds-of-the-highlands-disney-pixars-brave-transports-moviegoers-to-ancient-scotland-with-oscar-nominated-composer-patrick-doyle-plus-performers-julie-fowlis-and-birdy-with-mumford--sons-152256415.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|publisher=Walt Disney Records|date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying \"unaccompanied [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Scots Metrical Psalter .281650.29|psalm singing]].\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Cornwell|first=Tim|title=Scotland's Pixar tale hits the right note|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Scotland39s-Pixar-tale-hits-the.6793996.jp?articlepage=1|accessdate=September 6, 2011|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=July 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDoyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled \"A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan (Noble Maiden Fair)\" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The drinking song \"Song of Mor'du\" (lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell) sung by [[Billy Connolly]], Scott Davies, [[Patrick Doyle]], Gordon Neville, [[Alex Norton]] and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in [[Scots (language)|Scots]], which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. (Scots being a Germanic language, while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic.)\n\nIn addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; \"Learn Me Right\" written by [[Mumford & Sons]] and performed with [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]], \"Touch the Sky\" (music by Alex Mandel, lyrics by Mark Andrews & Mandel) and \"Into the Open Air\" (music and lyrics by Alex Mandel). Both \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" were performed by [[Julie Fowlis]], as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer.\n\nAlong with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.\n\n[[Walt Disney Records]] released the soundtrack on both CD album and digital download on June 19, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon.com: Brave: Various Artists, Patrick Doyle, James Shearman: Music|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Various-Artists/dp/B007XSFKAW| publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |accessdate = July 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tartans===\n[[File:DunBroch tartan.jpg|thumb|Clan DunBroch tartan, [[Scottish Tartans Authority|STA]] 10641]]\n\nPixar created three original [[tartan]] patterns for the film for three of the four clans \u2013 DunBroch, Dingwall, and MacGuffin.

The tartan consists of ocean blue for the [[North Sea]], subdued scarlet for bloodshed during the clan wars, deep green for the [[Scottish Highlands]], navy blue for the eventual unity of the four clans, and gray for the Scottish people. In selecting the color scheme, Pixar took historical considerations, stating that \"[t]here was a concerted effort to use hues that were indicative of the less saturated dyeing techniques [used] during the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|ancient period]] in which the fantasy film is set.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails.aspx?ref=10641|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe registration was celebrated at the film's British premiere in [[Edinburgh]], where Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] presented a certificate to director Mark Andrews.

Set in the [[Scottish Highlands]], the film tells the story of a princess named [[Merida (Disney)|Merida]] who defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in the kingdom by expressing the desire not to be betrothed.

While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.\n\nTen years later, Merida, now a big sister to identical triplets\u2014Harris, Hubert, and Hamish, discovers that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.\n\nThe allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans, and after a heated argument with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch. Merida bargains for a spell to change her fate, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.\n\nWhen Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to \"mend the bond torn by pride\" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.\n\nThey return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.\n\nMerida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unable to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her brothers, who have also eaten the enchanted cake. They are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the [[spirit]] of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects.\n\nWith Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.\n<!-- NOTE: Please do not add the post-credits scene to the plot summary.

To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as [[bagpipes]], a solo [[fiddle]], [[Cl\u00e0rsach|Celtic harps]], flutes and the [[bodhr\u00e1n]], with an electronically treated [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and [[cimbalom]] to give it a more contemporary feel.  \"I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as [[Reel (dance)|reels]], [[jig]]s, and [[Strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which not only serve the action but keep it authentic,\" said Doyle.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite press release|title=Sounds Of The Highlands; Disney-Pixar's \"Brave\" Transports Moviegoers to Ancient Scotland with Oscar-Nominated Composer Patrick Doyle, Plus Performers Julie Fowlis and Birdy (with Mumford & Sons)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sounds-of-the-highlands-disney-pixars-brave-transports-moviegoers-to-ancient-scotland-with-oscar-nominated-composer-patrick-doyle-plus-performers-julie-fowlis-and-birdy-with-mumford--sons-152256415.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|publisher=Walt Disney Records|date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying \"unaccompanied [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Scots Metrical Psalter .281650.29|psalm singing]].\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Cornwell|first=Tim|title=Scotland's Pixar tale hits the right note|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Scotland39s-Pixar-tale-hits-the.6793996.jp?articlepage=1|accessdate=September 6, 2011|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=July 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDoyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled \"A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan (Noble Maiden Fair)\" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The drinking song \"Song of Mor'du\" (lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell) sung by [[Billy Connolly]], Scott Davies, [[Patrick Doyle]], Gordon Neville, [[Alex Norton]] and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in [[Scots (language)|Scots]], which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. (Scots being a Germanic language, while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic.)\n\nIn addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; \"Learn Me Right\" written by [[Mumford & Sons]] and performed with [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]], \"Touch the Sky\" (music by Alex Mandel, lyrics by Mark Andrews & Mandel) and \"Into the Open Air\" (music and lyrics by Alex Mandel). Both \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" were performed by [[Julie Fowlis]], as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer.\n\nAlong with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.\n\n[[Walt Disney Records]] released the soundtrack on both CD album and digital download on June 19, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon.com: Brave: Various Artists, Patrick Doyle, James Shearman: Music|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Various-Artists/dp/B007XSFKAW| publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |accessdate = July 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tartans===\n[[File:DunBroch tartan.jpg|thumb|Clan DunBroch tartan, [[Scottish Tartans Authority|STA]] 10641]]\n\nPixar created three original [[tartan]] patterns for the film for three of the four clans \u2013 DunBroch, Dingwall, and MacGuffin.

The rules of the game have many similarities to those of association football. The game is played on a rectangle of ice, the same size as a football field. Each team has eleven players, one of whom is the goalkeeper. A standard bandy match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. The offside rule is also similar to that observed in football.\n\n== Biathlon ==\n[[Biathlon]] is the most popular winter sport in Russia and ranking 1st in overall polls and TV viewership for the winter seasons. [[Russia]] has had many successful biathletes and has won Olympic and World medals.

At every Winter Olympics from 1964 through 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair won gold, often considered the longest winning streak in modern sports history. The streak ended in 2010 when a Chinese pair won gold in [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics]], a Russian pair returned to winning gold in pairs at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]]. Even after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Russia still produced multiple Olympic and World Champions in figure skating notably [[Alexei Urmanov]], [[Ilia Kulik]], [[Alexei Yagudin]], [[Evgeni Plushenko]], [[Maria Butyrskaya]], [[Irina Slutskaya]], [[Adelina Sotnikova]], [[Yulia Lipnitskaya]], [[Maya Usova]], [[Alexander Zhulin]], [[Oksana Grishuk]], [[Evgeni Platov]], [[Anjelika Krylova]], [[Oleg Ovsyannikov]], [[Tatiana Navka]], [[Roman Kostomarov]], [[Ekaterina Gordeeva]], [[Sergei Grinkov]], [[Natalia Mishkutenok]], [[Artur Dmitriev]], [[Tatiana Totmianina]], [[Maxim Marinin]], [[Elena Berezhnaya]], [[Anton Sikhuralidze]], [[Tatiana Volosozhar]], [[Maxim Trankov]], [[Ksenia Stolbova]], [[Fedor Klimov]], [[Elena Ilinykh]], [[Nikita Katsalapov]], [[Elizaveta Tuktamysheva]], [[Evgenia Medvedeva]], [[Elena Radionova]].\n\nThe [[Russian Figure Skating Championships]] are a figure skating national championship held annually to determine the national champions of Russia. Skaters compete at the senior level in the disciplines of men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dancing.\nThe first Russian national competition was held on 5 March 1878 in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire. The winner was V. I. Sreznevski. From 1897\u2013present, official Russian national championships in figure skating were held. The first national champion of Russia in figure skating was Alexandr Nikitich Panshin, who won the Russian nationals from 1897 to 1900.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1990 Russian national championships in figure skating were not held.

The rules of the game have many similarities to those of association football. The game is played on a rectangle of ice, the same size as a football field. Each team has eleven players, one of whom is the goalkeeper. A standard bandy match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. The offside rule is also similar to that observed in football.\n\n== Biathlon ==\n[[Biathlon]] is the most popular winter sport in Russia and ranking 1st in overall polls and TV viewership for the winter seasons. [[Russia]] has had many successful biathletes and has won Olympic and World medals.

At every Winter Olympics from 1964 through 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair won gold, often considered the longest winning streak in modern sports history. The streak ended in 2010 when a Chinese pair won gold in [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics]], a Russian pair returned to winning gold in pairs at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]]. Even after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Russia still produced multiple Olympic and World Champions in figure skating notably [[Alexei Urmanov]], [[Ilia Kulik]], [[Alexei Yagudin]], [[Evgeni Plushenko]], [[Maria Butyrskaya]], [[Irina Slutskaya]], [[Adelina Sotnikova]], [[Yulia Lipnitskaya]], [[Maya Usova]], [[Alexander Zhulin]], [[Oksana Grishuk]], [[Evgeni Platov]], [[Anjelika Krylova]], [[Oleg Ovsyannikov]], [[Tatiana Navka]], [[Roman Kostomarov]], [[Ekaterina Gordeeva]], [[Sergei Grinkov]], [[Natalia Mishkutenok]], [[Artur Dmitriev]], [[Tatiana Totmianina]], [[Maxim Marinin]], [[Elena Berezhnaya]], [[Anton Sikhuralidze]], [[Tatiana Volosozhar]], [[Maxim Trankov]], [[Ksenia Stolbova]], [[Fedor Klimov]], [[Elena Ilinykh]], [[Nikita Katsalapov]], [[Elizaveta Tuktamysheva]], [[Evgenia Medvedeva]], [[Elena Radionova]].\n\nThe [[Russian Figure Skating Championships]] are a figure skating national championship held annually to determine the national champions of Russia. Skaters compete at the senior level in the disciplines of men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dancing.\nThe first Russian national competition was held on 5 March 1878 in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire. The winner was V. I. Sreznevski. From 1897\u2013present, official Russian national championships in figure skating were held. The first national champion of Russia in figure skating was Alexandr Nikitich Panshin, who won the Russian nationals from 1897 to 1900.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1990 Russian national championships in figure skating were not held.

It was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on April 3, 2020. It has an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance''. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, with its graphics, presentation, and gameplay receiving commendation, although criticism was directed towards its short length, pacing, and absence of elements from the original game.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Resident Evil 3'' is a remake of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', a [[survival horror]] video game released for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the remake features [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to the [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|2019 ''Resident Evil 2'' remake]]. {{anchor|Resident Evil: Resistance}}It includes an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance'', which puts a team of four players against a \"mastermind\" who can create traps, enemies, and other hazards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakeling |first1=Richard |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake Official Release Date On Consoles And PC Announced; RE Resistance Multiplayer Included |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212111645/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The beginning of ''Resident Evil 3'' however, has players briefly controlling Jill in a [[first person perspective]], in a dream and then in her apartment, engaging with the environment around her much like the characters you assume the role of in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/641723-resident-evil-3-remake-first-person-mode-pc-ps4-xbox-one</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Raccoon City]] is thrown into chaos by a [[zombie apocalypse]] caused by an outbreak of the [[T-Virus]]. On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]] is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[Biological agent|bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]], but Brad is bitten by a zombie and tells Jill to save herself. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai, and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nCarlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad, who is killed by Carlos shortly afterwards. The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office and watch a video message from Bard, who informs them that he is at a hospital. Meanwhile, as Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill escapes the wreckage of the derailed train only to be again pursued by Nemesis who is now heavily mutated. Jill radios Carlos and engages the monster, managing to escape it, but only after it infects her with the T-virus. Jill falls unconscious and Carlos finds her roughly half a day later, taking her to Spencer Memorial Hospital - the location of Bard. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. Jill attempts to destroy Nemesis in a vat of solution designed to dispose of any biological waste only for Nemesis to further mutate into a giant mass of flesh with tentacles. Jill then uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai for Jill to shoot.{{efn|If missed or not shot, Nicolai kills Jill and Carlos.<ref name=\"IGNdetails\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/21-brilliant-details-in-resident-evil-3|title=21 Brilliant Little Details in Resident Evil 3|website=IGN|date=3 April 2020|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>}} When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, some person wearing green, retrieves the vaccine case from a table.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its announcement in 2019.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Palumbo |first1=Alessio |title='Resident

On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]] is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[Biological agent|bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]], but Brad is bitten by a zombie and tells Jill to save herself. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai, and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nCarlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad before Carlos takes him out . The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office and watch a video message from Bard, who informs them that he is at a hospital. Meanwhile, as Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill escapes the wreckage of the derailed train only to be again pursued by Nemesis who is now heavily mutated. Jill radios Carlos and engages the monster, managing to escape it, but only after it infects her with the T-virus. Jill falls unconscious and Carlos finds her roughly half a day later, taking her to Spencer Memorial Hospital - the location of Bard. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. Jill attempts to destroy Nemesis in a vat of solution designed to dispose of any biological waste only for Nemesis to further mutate into a giant mass of flesh with tentacles. Jill then uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai for Jill to shoot.{{efn|If missed or not shot, Nicolai kills Jill and Carlos.<ref name=\"IGNdetails\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/21-brilliant-details-in-resident-evil-3|title=21 Brilliant Little Details in Resident Evil 3|website=IGN|date=3 April 2020|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>}} When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, some person wearing green, retrieves the vaccine case from a table.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its announcement in 2019.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Palumbo |first1=Alessio |title='Resident
