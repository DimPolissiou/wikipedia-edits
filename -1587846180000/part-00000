For example,  in the early 1970s he (and independently Howard Odum) were the first to point out the energy intensiveness of modern agriculture.<ref>Pimentel, D., L.E. Hurd, A.C. Bellotti, M.J.

In most of his studies he attempted to generate quantitative estimates, even of quite difficult and large scale issues.\n\nPimentel\u2019s approach was often associated with controversy. He was seen as overly \u201cgreen\u201d and hostile to conventional farming by some, and he was sometimes criticized for some of his numbers and conclusions.<ref>Is Ethanol Energy-Efficient? http://journeytoforever.org/ethanol_energy.html</ref> Usually later papers would back up his initial results.\n\n\n\n==Early life and education==\nPimentel was born on May 24, 1925, in Fresno, California and moved with his family to a farm in North Middleboro, Massachusetts.<ref>Whitecraft, Michele, Going Against \u201cProcedures\u201d: A Profile of Dave Pimentel.

The Newest Synthesis: Understanding the Interplay of Evolutionary and Ecological Dynamics. ''Science'' '''331''':426-429.</ref>\n\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn<ref>Pimentel, D., et al. (1973).</ref> was published during the energy crisis of 1973 and became his most cited paper ever. It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to becoming a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published, the results of which always could, and were, inspected and revised.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on his observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref> It was not an idea that was readily accepted, however, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E. Laing. (1976). \"The theoretical and empirical basis of biological control.\" Pages 41-78 in Huffaker,  C.B. (ed.) ''Biological Control'', Plenum Press, NY. 511 pp.</ref> They admitted that, \"Outstanding biological control successes have sometimes been achieved \u2026 by the use of natural enemies whose hosts belong to different species or genera from the pests they are needed to control,\u201d<ref>Wilson, F., and C.B., Huffaker. (1976). Pages 5-6 in Huffaker, C.B., and PS Messenger. (eds.) ''Theory and practice of biological control''. Academic Press, New York. 788 pp.</ref> but they then rejected (pp 47-49) Pimentel\u2019s work on genetic feedback as an explanatory mechanism involved in biocontrol by insect parasites and predators. Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989). New Associations in Biological Control: Theory and Practice.  ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''121''':829-840.</ref> Now called \u201cnew association biological control\u201d as opposed to \u201cclassical biological control,\u201d it is accepted practice.<ref>Van Driesche, R., and  M. Hoddle. (2009.) Pages 4-5 in ''Control of pests and weeds by natural enemies: an introduction to biological control''. Blackwell Publishing. Malden Massachusetts. 488 pp.</ref>\n\nPimentel was a pioneer in tabulating the energy cost, fossil fuel in particular, of food production. When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as an area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course to do so using his own students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and his colleagues. That paper then putatively initiated the controversy over the net energy and environmental impacts of gasohol crops.<ref>Ruttan, V.W. and Pimentel, D. (1975).

Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014).

They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. In a joint paper with one of his disputants, agronomist Bruce Dale, and arbitrated by the reputable ecologist and energy scientist, Charles Hall, who was annoyed at the critiques of Pimentel\u2019s estimates, or more accurately why there should be such large differences (about a factor of two) between two different estimates of what should be a pretty straightforward analysis, it was finally agreed that most of the energy used for each of the inputs (as, for example, for tractor fuel, fertilizer) were reasonably similar, although Pimentel tended to be more inclusive, including the energy cost to produce that fuel, and also the seeds, pesticides, steel etc.  needed.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D. Pimentel. (2011). Seeking to Understand the Reasons for Different Energy Return on Investment (EROI) Estimates for Biofuels.

Additionally Dale reduced his energy costs by about a quarter to give credit for \u201cco-products\u201d such as corn mash that could be fed to chickens. In that paper, Pimentel accepted that in some situations that would be appropriate.\n\nWhat was not said in that paper, or in the critiques more generally, was that the real issue was not whether the EROI for alcohol fuel was less than 0.8 to 1 versus the 1.7 to 1 estimated (with coproducts) by Dale. The issue was that what a society needed was not a marginal energy return on investment such as 1.7 to 1 but a substantially positive one, from 3 to 1 at a bare minimum to perhaps 12 to 1 for a society like we live in today.<ref>Hall, C.

In most of his studies he attempted to generate quantitative estimates, even of quite difficult and large scale issues.\n\nPimentel\u2019s approach was often associated with controversy. he was seen as overly \u201cgreen\u201d and hostile to conventional farming by some, and he was sometimes criticized for some of his numbers and conclusions.<ref>Is Ethanol Energy-Efficient? http://journeytoforever.org/ethanol_energy.html</ref> Usually later papers would back up his initial results.\n\n\n\n==Early life and education==\nPimentel was born on May 24, 1925, in Fresno, California and moved with his family to a farm in North Middelboro, Massachusetts.<ref>Whitecraft, Michele, Going Against \u201cProcedures\u201d: A Profile of Dave Pimentel.

The Newest Synthesis: Understanding the Interplay of Evolutionary and Ecological Dynamics. ''Science'' '''331''':426-429.</ref>\n\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn<ref>Pimentel, D., et al. (1973).</ref> was published during the energy crisis of 1973 and became his most cited paper ever. It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to becoming a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published, the results of which always could, and were, inspected and revised.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on his observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref> It was not an idea that was readily accepted, however, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E.

Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989).

When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as an area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course to do so using his own students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and his colleagues.

Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014). ''Energy'' '''64''':153-167</ref>. They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources.
