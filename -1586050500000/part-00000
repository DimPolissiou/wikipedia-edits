As of fall 2019, the college has approximately 1,700 enrolled (undergraduate and graduate) students.<ref name=\"facts\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.whittier.edu/about|title=Whittier College|publisher=Whittier College|url-status=live|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nWhittier College is a four-year liberal arts institution. Nearly half of the student body is Latinx and students of color constitute about 70% of the College's campus population, making Whittier one of the most diverse liberal arts colleges in the country. A majority of students hail from California but the College also draws students from the Pacific Northwest, East Coast, Midwest and Hawaii as well as international students. As of 2017, there are students from at least 27 states and 14 countries.<ref name=\"facts\"/>\n\nWhittier offers over 30 majors and 30 minors in 23 disciplines, and claims emphasis on interdisciplinary learning. Students may also apply for entry into the Whittier Scholars Program, in which each student, under the guidance of a faculty member, designs their own major and course of study based on individual interests and career goals. Professional internships and service projects are required or recommended as part of many academic programs. Study abroad is offered in semester- or year-long affiliated programs. There is also an optional January interim session, which is a four-week intensive \"mini-semester\" that typically involves fieldwork and faculty-led international travel.\n\nWhittier College hosts a Faculty House Program, which is modeled after similar programs at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities. In this program, faculty are selected as faculty-in-residence for a multi-year term, live in houses located on-campus, and create and host in their homes educational and social programs around a specific theme, such as health and society, writers and writing, alumni connections, and Spanish culture.\n\nAdditionally, the college's graduate program in education offers both credential and Master of Arts in education degree programs. Broadoaks Children's School \u2013 a private, non-profit demonstration school on the Whittier campus \u2013 serves as a learning laboratory for Whittier faculty and students, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.\n\nWhittier College has approximately 80 registered, student-run organizations. The College also has Societies similar to fraternities and sororities. There are 11 societies: the Franklin Society (male), the Lancer Society (male), the Orthogonian Society (male), the [[William Penn]] Society (male), Palmer Society (female), the Ionian Society (female), the Metaphonian Society (female), the Thalian Society (female), the Athenian Society (female), the Sachsen Society (coed), and the Paragonian Society (gender neutral). Most of these societies began as literary societies.\n\nOther campus groups include student publications, the ''Quaker Campus'' newspaper and television; the student-run radio station, KPOET Radio; Video Productions Studios; and the Whittier College Sports Network. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAlumni include: Former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]; actress [[Andrea Barber]], known from the television comedy ''[[Full House]]'' and ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]];'' social media entrepreneur [[Cassey Ho]]; actor [[Geoff Stults]]; author [[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]]; and Susan Herrman, who was one of two white female \"student [[Freedom Riders]]\" who sought to desegregate interstate bus travel in the South in 1961. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==History==\nWhittier College, founded in 1887, was named for the Quaker abolitionist and poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whittier.edu/giving/whittierfund|title=John Greenleaf Whittier Society|website=Whittier College|access-date=28 February 2018}}</ref> Since that time, the institution has grown into a distinctive, national liberal arts college. It serves a diverse student population with unique, widely praised curricula. The College campus provides an intimate environment in which about 1,700 students live and study with more than 100 distinguished faculty. Like other excellent liberal arts colleges, Whittier encourages students to become broadly educated rather than merely trained for a specific career. It emphasizes small, interactive classes led by full-time faculty members and requires that students cultivate the analytical, critical thinking, and rhetorical skills that all liberally educated persons enjoy.\n\nAlthough the College has maintained no formal affiliation with the Religious Society of Friends since the 1940s, the social values of its Quaker heritage\u2014respect for the individual, freedom of conscience, integrity, justice, and internationalism\u2014strongly influence its ethos. From the beginning, the same egalitarian views that placed Quakers in the forefront of the battle to abolish slavery dictated that the College open its doors to persons of both sexes as well as all races and cultures. Today, the College is a model for the nation with more than 60 percent of its undergraduates, and three of its four Rhodes Scholars, from underrepresented ethnic and international groups. This cultural diversity profoundly strengthens intellectual discourse and provides a realistic exposure to the kind of world students will enter upon graduation. Students and faculty continue a long tradition of community service, echoing the Quaker conviction that helping others is a moral obligation. International study opportunities enrich every field and major, reflecting the Quaker idea that truth transcends the boundaries of race, culture, and nation.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox US university ranking\n| Forbes = 344 (2016)\n| USNWR_LA = 127\n| Wamo_LA = 83\n}}\nBoth [[The Princeton Review]] and [[U.S. News & World Report]] have featured Whittier in its \u201cBest Liberal Arts Colleges\u201d listings, and U.S. News & World Report has consistently ranked Whittier among the top liberal arts colleges for \u201cEthnic Diversity.\u201d{{Clear}}\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Whittier 006a.jpg|thumb|250px|Southwest Quadrant]]\n\nThe Whittier College Poets compete in the [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (SCIAC) of [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The school has fielded sports teams for over 100 years. Its current teams include football, men's and women's basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, lacrosse and water polo, women's softball and volleyball, and men's baseball and golf.\n\nThe history of the Whittier College football program began in 1907, and since the inception of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1915, the Poets have captured 26 conference titles. From 1957\u20131964, Whittier won eight straight SCIAC titles under the direction of legendary coaches [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] (1951\u201356, 32-22-5), [[Don Coryell]] (1957\u201359), and John Godfrey (1960\u20131979). Their most recent championships came back-to-back in 1997 and 1998. Twenty-three Poets have earned All-American honors, the most recent coming in 2007. The football program plays out of Newman Memorial Field, which seats 7,000. Whittier maintains [[Occidental\u2013Whittier football rivalry|a century-long football rivalry]] with [[Occidental Tigers|the Tigers of Occidental College]]; the two schools play for the shoes of 1939 All-American Myron Claxton.\n\nThe Whittier Lacrosse Program was established in 1980. That year, the Poets became a member of the [[Western Collegiate Lacrosse League]] (WCLL). From 1980 to 1999, Whittier won ten championships. As a result of their success, Whittier decided to become the first and only NCAA lacrosse program on the west coast. In 1990, they were recognized by the NCAA, but continued to compete in the WCLL. The Poets were the team to beat throughout the 1990s and it was not until 2000 when Whittier made the decision to make their mark on the national scene by leaving the WCLL and focus on being selected for the NCAA tournament. The lacrosse team has been a national contender every year since 2000 in the NCAA, as a quarter-finalist in 2003, and a semi-finalist in 2004.\n\nThe Whittier College men's water polo team has gone number 1 in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Polls (CWPA) in Division III no fewer than four times. Starting in 2004, another time in 2009, and two years in a row starting in 2013 and 2014. On the season the Poets finished 23-10 and ranked No. 1 in the country among Division III programs. Whittier shared the top honor with Redlands and was ranked No. 18 in the Men's National Collegiate Top 20 Poll \u2013 a poll that ranks all divisions of collegiate water polo.\n\nThe Whittier Cross Country team made its mark in 2016. For the first time in program history, the Whittier College Men's Cross-Country team earned a national ranking announced by the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. The Purple & Gold ranked #32 out of 400 teams. T\n\nThe Whittier College Men's & Women's Swimming & Diving teams earned Academic All-American status \u2013 the women for the fourth straight year and the men for the first time, after the College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) announced the programs who achieved this honor for the 2015 Fall Semester. Five hundred forty-seven swimming and diving teams representing 354 colleges and universities have been named College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) Scholar All-American Teams. The awards are in recognition of teams that achieved a grade point average of 3.0 or higher during the 2015 fall semester. That is up 40 teams from the previous fall semester. The women's team finished with a 3.35 overall G.P.A. and the men had a 3.00 G.P.A.\n\n==Whittier Law School==\n\n[[Whittier Law School]], located on a satellite campus in [[Costa Mesa, California]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.whittier.edu/|title=Whittier Law School - A Southern California ABA Accredited Law School|website=www.law.whittier.edu}}</ref> started in the [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles, California|Hancock Park]] section of [[Los Angeles]] in 1966 as Beverly Law School.

As of fall 2019, the college has approximately 1,700 enrolled (undergraduate and graduate) students.<ref name=\"facts\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.whittier.edu/about|title=Whittier College|publisher=Whittier College|url-status=live|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nWhittier College is a four-year liberal arts institution. Nearly half of the student body is Latinx and students of color constitute about 70% of the College's campus population, making Whittier one of the most diverse liberal arts colleges in the country. A majority of students hail from California but the College also draws students from the Pacific Northwest, East Coast, Midwest and Hawaii as well as international students. As of 2017, there are students from at least 27 states and 14 countries.<ref name=\"facts\"/>\n\nWhittier offers over 30 majors and 30 minors in 23 disciplines, and claims emphasis on interdisciplinary learning. Students may also apply for entry into the Whittier Scholars Program, in which each student, under the guidance of a faculty member, designs their own major and course of study based on individual interests and career goals. Professional internships and service projects are required or recommended as part of many academic programs. Study abroad is offered in semester- or year-long affiliated programs. There is also an optional January interim session, which is a four-week intensive \"mini-semester\" that typically involves fieldwork and faculty-led international travel.\n\nWhittier College hosts a Faculty House Program, which is modeled after similar programs at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities. In this program, faculty are selected as faculty-in-residence for a multi-year term, live in houses located on-campus, and create and host in their homes educational and social programs around a specific theme, such as health and society, writers and writing, alumni connections, and Spanish culture.\n\nAdditionally, the college's graduate program in education offers both credential and Master of Arts in education degree programs. Broadoaks Children's School \u2013 a private, non-profit demonstration school on the Whittier campus \u2013 serves as a learning laboratory for Whittier faculty and students, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.\n\nWhittier College has approximately 80 registered, student-run organizations. The College also has Societies similar to fraternities and sororities. There are 11 societies: the Franklin Society (male), the Lancer Society (male), the Orthogonian Society (male), the [[William Penn]] Society (male), Palmer Society (female), the Ionian Society (female), the Metaphonian Society (female), the Thalian Society (female), the Athenian Society (female), the Sachsen Society (coed), and the Paragonian Society (gender neutral). Most of these societies began as literary societies.\n\nOther campus groups include student publications, the ''Quaker Campus'' newspaper and television; the student-run radio station, KPOET Radio; Video Productions Studios; and the Whittier College Sports Network. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAlumni include: Former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]; actress [[Andrea Barber]], known from the television comedy ''[[Full House]]'' and ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]];'' social media entrepreneur [[Cassey Ho]]; actor [[Geoff Stults]]; author [[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]]; and Susan Herrman, who was one of two white female \"student [[Freedom Riders]]\" who sought to desegregate interstate bus travel in the South in 1961. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==History==\nWhittier College, founded in 1887, was named for the Quaker abolitionist and poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whittier.edu/giving/whittierfund|title=John Greenleaf Whittier Society|website=Whittier College|access-date=28 February 2018}}</ref> Since that time, the institution has grown into a distinctive, national liberal arts college. It serves a diverse student population with unique, widely praised curricula. The College campus provides an intimate environment in which about 1,700 students live and study with more than 100 distinguished faculty. Like other excellent liberal arts colleges, Whittier encourages students to become broadly educated rather than merely trained for a specific career. It emphasizes small, interactive classes led by full-time faculty members and requires that students cultivate the analytical, critical thinking, and rhetorical skills that all liberally educated persons enjoy.\n\nAlthough the College has maintained no formal affiliation with the Religious Society of Friends since the 1940s, the social values of its Quaker heritage\u2014respect for the individual, freedom of conscience, integrity, justice, and internationalism\u2014strongly influence its ethos. From the beginning, the same egalitarian views that placed Quakers in the forefront of the battle to abolish slavery dictated that the College open its doors to persons of both sexes as well as all races and cultures. Today, the College is a model for the nation with more than 60 percent of its undergraduates, and three of its four Rhodes Scholars, from underrepresented ethnic and international groups. This cultural diversity profoundly strengthens intellectual discourse and provides a realistic exposure to the kind of world students will enter upon graduation. Students and faculty continue a long tradition of community service, echoing the Quaker conviction that helping others is a moral obligation. International study opportunities enrich every field and major, reflecting the Quaker idea that truth transcends the boundaries of race, culture, and nation.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox US university ranking\n| Forbes = 344 (2016)\n| USNWR_LA = 127\n| Wamo_LA = 83\n}}\nBoth [[The Princeton Review]] and [[U.S. News & World Report]] have featured Whittier in its \u201cBest Liberal Arts Colleges\u201d listings, and U.S. News & World Report has consistently ranked Whittier among the top liberal arts colleges for \u201cEthnic Diversity.\u201d{{Clear}}\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Whittier 006a.jpg|thumb|250px|Southwest Quadrant]]\n\nThe Whittier College Poets compete in the [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (SCIAC) of [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The school has fielded sports teams for over 100 years. Its current teams include football, men's and women's basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, lacrosse and water polo, women's softball and volleyball, and men's baseball and golf.\n\nThe history of the Whittier College football program began in 1907, and since the inception of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1915, the Poets have captured 26 conference titles. From 1957\u20131964, Whittier won eight straight SCIAC titles under the direction of legendary coaches [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] (1951\u201356, 32-22-5), [[Don Coryell]] (1957\u201359), and John Godfrey (1960\u20131979). Their most recent championships came back-to-back in 1997 and 1998. Twenty-three Poets have earned All-American honors, the most recent coming in 2007. The football program plays out of Newman Memorial Field, which seats 7,000. Whittier maintains [[Occidental\u2013Whittier football rivalry|a century-long football rivalry]] with [[Occidental Tigers|the Tigers of Occidental College]]; the two schools play for the shoes of 1939 All-American Myron Claxton.\n\nThe Whittier Lacrosse Program was established in 1980. That year, the Poets became a member of the [[Western Collegiate Lacrosse League]] (WCLL). From 1980 to 1999, Whittier won ten championships. As a result of their success, Whittier decided to become the first and only NCAA lacrosse program on the west coast. In 1990, they were recognized by the NCAA, but continued to compete in the WCLL. The Poets were the team to beat throughout the 1990s and it was not until 2000 when Whittier made the decision to make their mark on the national scene by leaving the WCLL and focus on being selected for the NCAA tournament. The lacrosse team has been a national contender every year since 2000 in the NCAA, as a quarter-finalist in 2003, and a semi-finalist in 2004.\n\nThe Whittier College men's water polo team has gone number 1 in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Polls (CWPA) in Division III no fewer than four times. Starting in 2004, another time in 2009, and two years in a row starting in 2013 and 2014. On the season the Poets finished 23-10 and ranked No. 1 in the country among Division III programs. Whittier shared the top honor with Redlands and was ranked No. 18 in the Men's National Collegiate Top 20 Poll \u2013 a poll that ranks all divisions of collegiate water polo.\n\nThe Whittier Cross Country team made its mark in 2016. For the first time in program history, the Whittier College Men's Cross-Country team earned a national ranking announced by the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. The Purple & Gold ranked #32 out of 400 teams. T\n\nThe Whittier College Men's & Women's Swimming & Diving teams earned Academic All-American status \u2013 the women for the fourth straight year and the men for the first time, after the College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) announced the programs who achieved this honor for the 2015 Fall Semester. Five hundred forty-seven swimming and diving teams representing 354 colleges and universities have been named College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) Scholar All-American Teams. The awards are in recognition of teams that achieved a grade point average of 3.0 or higher during the 2015 fall semester. That is up 40 teams from the previous fall semester. The women's team finished with a 3.35 overall G.P.A. and the men had a 3.00 G.P.A.\n\n==Whittier Law School==\n\n[[Whittier Law School]], located on a satellite campus in [[Costa Mesa, California]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.whittier.edu/|title=Whittier Law School - A Southern California ABA Accredited Law School|website=www.law.whittier.edu}}</ref> started in the [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles, California|Hancock Park]] section of [[Los Angeles]] in 1966 as Beverly Law School.

It is named after the [[Limpopo River]], which forms the province's western and northern borders. The name \"Limpopo\" has its etymological origin in the [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele language]], the original inhabitants of the area,  meaning \"strong gushing waterfalls\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Limpopo Province - An Overview|url=http://www.dolimpopo.com/limpopo-province|website=dolimpopo.com|accessdate=20 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201235654/http://www.dolimpopo.com/limpopo-province|archive-date=1 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The capital is [[Polokwane]] (formerly Pietersburg).\n\nThe province was formed from the northern region of [[Transvaal Province]] in 1994, and was initially named '''Northern Transvaal'''. The following year, it was renamed '''Northern Province''', which remained the name until 2003, when it was [[Geographical renaming|formally changed]] to Limpopo after deliberation by the provincial government and amendment of the [[Constitution of South Africa|South African Constitution]]. An alternate name considered for the province was [[Mapungubwe]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Northern Ndebele people|Northern Ndebele]] people traditionally are the majority in the province. However, majority of them now speak Sepedi which is a home language for the Sekhukhune district. Most Matebele (BakaLanga and BakaSeleka) clans have been assimulated into the Pedi and Tswana communities. The [[Northern Ndebele people|Northern Ndebele]] are found from Hammarskraal, Mokopane, Zebediela right up to the Limpopo river. Some moved north and settled among the Venda people and got assimilated like the Chivhase and Mhwaduba chieftancies. The maTsonga make up 17.0% of the population while their neighbors the [[VhaVenda]] make up 16.7%. The Pulana and Khilobedu languages are in an unwritten form and efforts have been made to resuscitate the languages. {{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nTraditional leaders and chiefs still form a strong backbone of the province\u2019s political landscape. Established in terms of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders Act, Act 5 of 2005, the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders\u2019 main function is to advise government and the legislature on matters related to custom, tradition and culture including developmental initiatives that have an impact on rural communities. On 18 August 2017 Kgoshi Malesela Dikgale was re-elected as the Chairperson of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe [[Zion Christian Church]] (or ZCC) is the largest African initiated church operating across [[Southern Africa]]. The church's headquarters are at Zion City Moria in Limpopo Province, South Africa (Northern Transvaal). The church was founded by [[Engenas Lekganyane]] in 1910 in his home village of Thabakgone, near Polokwane (Pietersburg).{{cn|date=March 2020}}  \n\nAccording to the 1996 South African Census, the church numbered 3.87 million members. By the 2001 South African Census, its membership had increased to 4.97 million members. The final number of ZCC members is most likely between 8 and 10 million, in total, according to figures provided by Neal Collins from ''[[The New Age (South African newspaper)|The New Age]]'' and Alex Matlala from ''The Citizen'', two South African newspapers.\n\n==Geography==\nLimpopo Province shares international borders with districts and provinces of three countries: [[Botswana]]'s [[Central District (Botswana)|Central]] and [[Kgatleng District|Kgatleng]] districts to the west and northwest respectively, [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[Matabeleland South]] and [[Masvingo (province)|Masvingo]] provinces to the north and northeast respectively, and [[Mozambique]]'s [[Gaza Province]] to the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minister Dlamini to conduct two day Ministerial visit in Vhembe|url=http://www.limpopo.gov.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=3|website=Limpopo.gov.za|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Limpopo is the link between South Africa and countries further afield in sub-Saharan Africa.

It is named after the [[Limpopo River]], which forms the province's western and northern borders. The name \"Limpopo\" has its etymological origin in the [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele language]], the original inhabitants of the area,  meaning \"strong gushing waterfalls\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Limpopo Province - An Overview|url=http://www.dolimpopo.com/limpopo-province|website=dolimpopo.com|accessdate=20 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201235654/http://www.dolimpopo.com/limpopo-province|archive-date=1 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The capital is [[Polokwane]] (formerly Pietersburg).\n\nThe province was formed from the northern region of [[Transvaal Province]] in 1994, and was initially named '''Northern Transvaal'''. The following year, it was renamed '''Northern Province''', which remained the name until 2003, when it was [[Geographical renaming|formally changed]] to Limpopo after deliberation by the provincial government and amendment of the [[Constitution of South Africa|South African Constitution]]. An alternate name considered for the province was [[Mapungubwe]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Northern Ndebele people|Northern Ndebele]] people traditionally are the majority in the province. However, majority of them now speak Sepedi which is a home language for the Sekhukhune district. Most Matebele (BakaLanga and BakaSeleka) clans have been assimulated into the Pedi and Tswana communities. The [[Northern Ndebele people|Northern Ndebele]] are found from Hammarskraal, Mokopane, Zebediela right up to the Limpopo river. Some moved north and settled among the Venda people and got assimilated like the Chivhase and Mhwaduba chieftancies. The maTsonga make up 17.0% of the population while their neighbors the [[VhaVenda]] make up 16.7%. The Pulana and Khilobedu languages are in an unwritten form and efforts have been made to resuscitate the languages. {{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nTraditional leaders and chiefs still form a strong backbone of the province\u2019s political landscape. Established in terms of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders Act, Act 5 of 2005, the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders\u2019 main function is to advise government and the legislature on matters related to custom, tradition and culture including developmental initiatives that have an impact on rural communities. On 18 August 2017 Kgoshi Malesela Dikgale was re-elected as the Chairperson of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe [[Zion Christian Church]] (or ZCC) is the largest African initiated church operating across [[Southern Africa]]. The church's headquarters are at Zion City Moria in Limpopo Province, South Africa (Northern Transvaal). The church was founded by [[Engenas Lekganyane]] in 1910 in his home village of Thabakgone, near Polokwane (Pietersburg).{{cn|date=March 2020}}  \n\nAccording to the 1996 South African Census, the church numbered 3.87 million members. By the 2001 South African Census, its membership had increased to 4.97 million members. The final number of ZCC members is most likely between 8 and 10 million, in total, according to figures provided by Neal Collins from ''[[The New Age (South African newspaper)|The New Age]]'' and Alex Matlala from ''The Citizen'', two South African newspapers.\n\n==Geography==\nLimpopo Province shares international borders with districts and provinces of three countries: [[Botswana]]'s [[Central District (Botswana)|Central]] and [[Kgatleng District|Kgatleng]] districts to the west and northwest respectively, [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[Matabeleland South]] and [[Masvingo (province)|Masvingo]] provinces to the north and northeast respectively, and [[Mozambique]]'s [[Gaza Province]] to the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minister Dlamini to conduct two day Ministerial visit in Vhembe|url=http://www.limpopo.gov.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=3|website=Limpopo.gov.za|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Limpopo is the link between South Africa and countries further afield in sub-Saharan Africa.

These [[episode]]s should typically share the same main characters, some different secondary characters and a basic theme. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a [[miniseries]], a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. They can be broadcast on [[television]], shown in [[movie theatre]]s, released [[direct-to-video]] or on the [[internet]]. Like animated films, animated series can be of a wide variety of [[List of genres|genres]] and can also have different [[target audience]]s, from [[children]] to [[adult animation|adults]].\n\n==Television==\n{{see also|List of animated television series}}\nAnimated [[television program|television series]] are regularly presented and can appear as much as up to once a week or daily during a prescribed [[time slot]]. The time slot may vary including morning, like [[saturday-morning cartoon]]s, prime time, like [[prime time cartoon]]s, to late night, like [[late night anime]]. They may also be broadcast on weekdays ([[weekday cartoon]]s) or only on weekends.\n\nThe duration of each episode varies depending on the series. Traditionally, series are produced as complete half-hour or nearly half-hour programs; however, many are produced as animated [[Short film|shorts]] of 10\u201311 minutes, which can then paired with other shorts to fill a set time period. If on television 15-20 minutes based on commercial time.

They may also be broadcast on weekdays ([[weekday cartoon]]s) or only on weekends.\n\nThe duration of each episode varies depending on the series.

About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. [[SEAL Team 6]] has been heavily involved in many of these operations.
