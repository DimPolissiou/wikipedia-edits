Sometimes the runners are referred to as ''harriers''.<ref>[http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/why-are-runners-often-called-harriers Runners World.] Accessed 9 March 2015.</ref> The course, typically {{convert|4|-|12|km|mi|}} long, may include surfaces of [[grass]], and [[soil|earth]], pass through [[woodland]]s and open country, and include [[hill]]s, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an [[individual sport|individual]] and a [[team sport]]; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during [[autumn]] and [[winter]], and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.\n\nCross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], and is a natural terrain version of [[long-distance running|long-distance]] [[track and field|track]] and [[road running]]. Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the [[International Cross Country Championships]] was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html Cross country \u2013 Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227014746/http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html |date=2011-02-27 }}. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved 14 February 2011.</ref>\n\n==Race course==\nCross country courses are laid out on an open or woodland area. The [[IAAF]] recommends that courses be grass-covered, and have rolling terrain with frequent but smooth turns. Courses consist of one or more loops, with a long straight at the start and another leading to the finish line.\n\n===Course design===\nTerrain can vary from open fields to forest hills and even across rivers. It also includes running down and up hills. Because of variations in conditions, international standardization of cross country courses is impossible, and not necessarily desirable. Part of cross country running's appeal is the distinct characteristics of each venue's terrain and weather, as in other outdoor sports like [[motor racing]], [[cycling]] and [[golf]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF, an ideal cross country course has a loop of {{convert|1750|to|2000|m|yd}} laid out on an open or wooded land. It should be covered by grass, as much as possible, and include rolling hills \"with smooth curves and short straights\". While it is perfectly acceptable for local conditions to make dirt or snow the primary surface, courses should minimize running on roads or other macadamized paths. Parks and golf courses often provide suitable locations.\n\nWhile a course may include natural or artificial obstacles, cross country courses support continuous running, and do not require climbing over high barriers, through deep ditches, or fighting through the underbrush, as do military-style [[assault course]]s.<ref name=WorldAthleticsRules>[https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=1a53ca10-7f30-46e4-83fe-e7ff5fda2c60.pdf&urlslug=C2.1%20-%20Technical%20Rules%20(amended%20on%2031%20January%202020) World Athletics Book of Rules C2.1 - Technical Rules (amended on 31 January 2020)]. [[World Athletics]]. Retrieved 2 February 2020.</ref>\n\nA course at least {{convert|5|m|yd}} full allows competitors to pass others during the race. Clear markings keep competitors from making wrong turns, and spectators from interfering with the competition. Markings may include tape or ribbon on both sides of the course, chalk or paint on the ground, or cones. Some classes use colored flags to indicate directions: red flags for left turns, yellow flags for right turns, and blue flags to continue straight or stay within ten feet of the flag. Courses also commonly include distance markings, usually at each kilometer or each mile.<ref name=USATFRules>[http://www.usatf.org/about/rules/2011/2011rules.pdf USA Track & Field 2011 Competition Rules]. [[USATF]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\nThe course should have {{convert|400|to|1200|m|yd|abbr=on}} of level terrain before the first turn, to reduce contact and congestion at the start. However, many courses at smaller competitions have their first turn after a much shorter distance.<ref name=NCAARules>[http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/TF12.pdf 2011/2012 NCAA Men's and Women's Track & Field and Cross Country Rules]. [[NCAA]]. Retrieved 11 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Distances===\nCourses for international competitions consist of a loop between 1750 and 2000 meters. Athletes complete three to six loops, depending on the race. Senior men and women compete on a 10 kilometre course. Junior men compete on an 8-kilometre course and junior women compete on a 6-kilometre course.<ref name=\"WorldAthleticsRules\"/>\n\nIn the United States, college men typically compete on {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} courses, while college women race for {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NCAARules\"/> High school courses are generally {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}.  Middle school courses are usually {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} long.\n\n===Start===\n[[File:XCgunstart.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The start of a typical cross country race, as an official fires a gun to signal the start]]\nAll runners start at the same time, from a starting [[arc (geometry)|arc]] (or line) marked with lines or boxes for each team or individual. An official, 50 meters or more in front of the starting line, fires a pistol to indicate the start. If runners collide and fall within the first 100 meters, officials can call the runners back and restart the race, however this is done only once. Crossing the line or starting before the starting pistol is fired is considered a false start and most often results in disqualification of the runner.\n\n===Finish===\nThe course ends at a finish line located at the beginning of a ''funnel'' or ''chute'' (a long walkway marked with flags) that keeps athletes single-file in order of finish and facilitates accurate scoring.\n\nDepending on the timing and scoring system, finish officials may collect a small slip from each runner's bib, to keep track of finishing positions. An alternative method (standard in the UK) is to have four officials in two pairs. In the first pair, one official reads out numbers of finishers and the other records them. In the second pair, one official reads out times for the other to record. At the end of the race, the two lists are joined along with information from the entry information. The primary disadvantage of this system is that distractions can easily upset the results, particularly when scores of runners finish close together.\n\n[[Transponder timing|Chip timing]] has grown in popularity to increase accuracy and decrease the number of officials required at the finish line. Each runner attaches a [[transponder]] with [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] to his or her shoe. When the runner crosses the finish line, an electronic pad records the chip number and matches the runner to a database. Chip timing allows officials to use checkpoint mats throughout the race to calculate split times, and to ensure runners cover the entire course. This is by far the most efficient method, although it is also the most expensive. The drawback to chip timing is its inability to separate a close finish properly. Chips times the feet, when the rule books say it is the torso that counts. It is technically possible for an athlete to fall across the finish line, legally crossing the finish line, but with their feet too far away from the sensor to have their finish recorded.\n\nContemporary races have now started to use [[fully automatic timing]] systems for [[photo finish]] accuracy to their results. This has dramatically improved the timing mechanisms of Cross Country over the last few years.\n\n==Scoring==\nScores are determined by summing the top four or five individual finishing places on each team. In international competition, a team typically consists of six runners, with the top four scoring. In the United States, the most common scoring system is seven runners, with the top five scoring. Points are awarded to the individual runners of eligible teams, equal to the position in which they cross the finish line (first place gets 1 point, second place gets 2 points, etc.). The points for these runners are summed, and the lowest score wins. Individual athletes, and athletes from incomplete teams (teams consisting of less than 5 athletes or teams) and individuals who have been disqualified are excluded from scoring. Ties are usually broken by the position of each team's sixth runner.\n\nThe lowest possible score in a five-to-score match is 15 (1+2+3+4+5), achieved by a team's runners finishing in each of the top five positions. If there is a single opposing team then they would have a score of 40 (6+7+8+9+10), which can be considered a \"sweep\" for the winning team. In some competitions a team's sixth and seventh runner are scored in the overall field and are known as \"pushers\" or \"displacers\" as their place can count ahead of other runners, giving other teams more points. In the above match, if there are two non-scoring runners and they came 6th and 7th overall, the opponent's score would be 50 (8+9+10+11+12). Accordingly, the official score of a forfeited dual meet is 15\u201350.\n\n==Strategy==\nBecause of differences between courses in running surface, frequency and tightness of turns, and amount of up and downhill, cross country [[strategy]] does not necessarily simplify to running a steady pace from start to finish. [[Coach (sport)|Coach]]es and cross country runners debate the relative merits of fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether you run ahead 'of the pack' or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner's individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.<ref>Groves, Harry. ''Tactics & Strategy''.

Most races are run in shorts and vests or singlets, usually in club or school colours. In particularly cold conditions, long-sleeved shirts and tights can be worn to retain warmth without losing mobility. The most common footwear are [[Cross country running shoe|cross country spikes]], lightweight racing shoes with a rubber sole and five or more metal spikes screwed into the forefoot part of the sole. Spike length depends on race conditions, with a muddy course appropriate for spikes as long as {{convert|25|mm|in}}. If a course has a harder surface, spikes as short as {{convert|6|mm|in}} may be most effective. While spikes are suitable for grassy, muddy, or other slippery conditions, runners may choose to wear [[racing flats]], rubber-soled racing shoes without spikes, if the course includes significant portions of paved surfaces or dirt road.<ref name=NFHSRules>2011 NFHS Track & Field and Cross Country Rules Book. [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]].</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:2010 European Cross Country Championships.jpg|thumb|Runners at the [[2010 European Cross Country Championships]] in [[Portugal]]]]\nFormal cross country competition traces its history to the 19th century and an English game called \"hare and hounds\" or \"the [[Paper Chase (game)|paper chase]]\". English schools started competing in cross country races in 1837, and established a national championship on December 7, 1867. It was held on [[Wimbledon Common]] in south-west London. It was the first cross country race that was considered \"open\", or could be run by anyone. Its original purpose was to imitate steeplechase for off-season training, and was considered a bit of a joke.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The race was about 3.5 miles long, and went through very boggy and hilly terrain. The course was not well marked, and many competitors got lost. Matters were not helped by the fact that the race was run in the dark, as it began at 5 pm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burfoot|first=Amby|title=Common Ground|journal=Runners World|date=July 2006|volume=92}}</ref>{{MOS|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Olympic Games===\n{{main|Cross country running at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Ind cross country 1924 Summer Olympics.jpg|300px|thumb|Individual cross country race at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

[[England]] won the first 14 titles, and 43 of 59 until the IAAF took over the competition in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]]. [[France]] was the next most successful country in the early years, winning 12 championships between 1922 and 1956. [[Belgium]] is the only other country to win at the International Cross Country Championship, capturing titles in 1948, 1957, 1961 and 1963. The English also dominated the individual competition, with an Englishman winning the individual title 35 times, including three wins by [[Jack Holden (athlete)|Jack Holden]] (1933\u20131935).\n\nThe first international cross country championship for women was held in 1931, and thirteen more times through 1972. England won 12 of these early championships, losing only in 1968 and 1969 (to the United States). American [[Doris Brown]] won five consecutive individual titles between 1967 and 1971.\n\nBeginning in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]], the IAAF began hosting the renamed [[World Cross Country Championships]] each year. In [[1975 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1975]], the [[New Zealand]] men and United States women won, marking the first championships by non-European countries. In [[1981 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1981]] an African nation ([[Ethiopia]]) won the men's race for the first time, and [[1991 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|a decade later]] an African nation ([[Kenya]]) won the women's race for the first time.

Most matches are parts of different cross country leagues, which are organized on an ''ad hoc'' basis. These vary from large, high quality leagues, such as the [[London Metropolitan Cross Country League]], [[Birmingham]] League, [[Hampshire]] League, Essex League and [[Surrey]] League (which is unusual in requiring ten runners to score) to small, local leagues (such as the [[Gloucestershire]] AA league), and individual clubs can (and typically are) member of several leagues.\n\nTypically there will be four or five fixtures a season. Also, there are county championships, area championships (North, South, and Midlands), the national championship (whose location rotates around the three areas), and the Inter-Counties Championship organised by the [[UK Counties Athletics Union]], where runners compete for their counties and not their clubs.\n\nThere can be many additional inter-club matches, particularly among the older clubs. Most league matches are around {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and most championships 12 to 15&nbsp;km (approximately 7\u00bd to 9 miles) long. Most clubs are mixed, though men's and women's races tend to be run separately.\n\nSecondary school-aged students are also to compete at local schools races, with a set number of students qualifying for county level, at which there is a further race to be eligible for the relevant national schools cross country race (e.g. the English Schools Cross Country).\n\nAt university level, there is considerable competition available. University clubs typically compete both locally (via English Athletics) as well as between universities - with larger fixtures organized through [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]].\n\nPrimary schools, although more often the juniors, also participate in cross country events and some areas of England have done so since the late 1960s. An example would be schools near [[Ouston, County Durham]] which compete as part of Chester-le-Street & District Primary Cross Country Association.<ref>[http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ Chester-le-street schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141808/http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ |date=2012-04-25 }}.

Beginning in 1979, the [[Foot Locker Cross Country Championships]] have offered a national championship for high school cross country runners. Since 2004, the [[Nike Cross Nationals]] have offered an alternative national championship, focused on teams rather than individuals. A 2008 film, ''The Long Green Line'', documented the success of Joe Newton, cross country coach at [[York Community High School]] in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1267833/ The Long Green Line (2008) \u2013 IMDb] [[IMDb]].</ref>\n\nWhile many middle schools (grades 6\u20138) in the U.S. offer cross country as a school sport, youth running clubs dominate in this age group.

Sometimes the runners are referred to as ''harriers''.<ref>[http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/why-are-runners-often-called-harriers Runners World.] Accessed 9 March 2015.</ref> The course, typically {{convert|4|-|12|km|mi|}} long, may include surfaces of [[grass]], and [[soil|earth]], pass through [[woodland]]s and open country, and include [[hill]]s, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an [[individual sport|individual]] and a [[team sport]]; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during [[autumn]] and [[winter]], and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.\n\nCross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], and is a natural terrain version of [[long-distance running|long-distance]] [[track and field|track]] and [[road running]]. Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the [[International Cross Country Championships]] was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html Cross country \u2013 Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227014746/http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html |date=2011-02-27 }}. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved 14 February 2011.</ref>\n\n==Race course==\nCross country courses are laid out on an open or woodland area. The [[IAAF]] recommends that courses be grass-covered, and have rolling terrain with frequent but smooth turns. Courses consist of one or more loops, with a long straight at the start and another leading to the finish line.\n\n===Course design===\nTerrain can vary from open fields to forest hills and even across rivers. It also includes running down and up hills. Because of variations in conditions, international standardization of cross country courses is impossible, and not necessarily desirable. Part of cross country running's appeal is the distinct characteristics of each venue's terrain and weather, as in other outdoor sports like [[motor racing]], [[cycling]] and [[golf]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF, an ideal cross country course has a loop of {{convert|1750|to|2000|m|yd}} laid out on an open or wooded land. It should be covered by grass, as much as possible, and include rolling hills \"with smooth curves and short straights\". While it is perfectly acceptable for local conditions to make dirt or snow the primary surface, courses should minimize running on roads or other macadamized paths. Parks and golf courses often provide suitable locations.\n\nWhile a course may include natural or artificial obstacles, cross country courses support continuous running, and do not require climbing over high barriers, through deep ditches, or fighting through the underbrush, as do military-style [[assault course]]s.<ref name=WorldAthleticsRules>[https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=1a53ca10-7f30-46e4-83fe-e7ff5fda2c60.pdf&urlslug=C2.1%20-%20Technical%20Rules%20(amended%20on%2031%20January%202020) World Athletics Book of Rules C2.1 - Technical Rules (amended on 31 January 2020)]. [[World Athletics]]. Retrieved 2 February 2020.</ref>\n\nA course at least {{convert|5|m|yd}} full allows competitors to pass others during the race. Clear markings keep competitors from making wrong turns, and spectators from interfering with the competition. Markings may include tape or ribbon on both sides of the course, chalk or paint on the ground, or cones. Some classes use colored flags to indicate directions: red flags for left turns, yellow flags for right turns, and blue flags to continue straight or stay within ten feet of the flag. Courses also commonly include distance markings, usually at each kilometer or each mile.<ref name=USATFRules>[http://www.usatf.org/about/rules/2011/2011rules.pdf USA Track & Field 2011 Competition Rules].

[[NCAA]]. Retrieved 11 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Distances===\nCourses for international competitions consist of a loop between 1750 and 2000 meters. Athletes complete three to six loops, depending on the race. Senior men and women compete on a 10 kilometre course. Junior men compete on an 8-kilometre course and junior women compete on a 6-kilometre course.<ref name=\"WorldAthleticsRules\"/>\n\nIn the United States, college men typically compete on {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} courses, while college women race for {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NCAARules\"/> High school courses are generally {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}.  Middle school courses are usually {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} long.\n\n===Start===\n[[File:XCgunstart.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The start of a typical cross country race, as an official fires a gun to signal the start]]\nAll runners start at the same time, from a starting [[arc (geometry)|arc]] (or line) marked with lines or boxes for each team or individual. An official, 50 meters or more in front of the starting line, fires a pistol to indicate the start. If runners collide and fall within the first 100 meters, officials can call the runners back and restart the race, however this is done only once. Crossing the line or starting before the starting pistol is fired is considered a false start and most often results in disqualification of the runner.\n\n===Finish===\nThe course ends at a finish line located at the beginning of a ''funnel'' or ''chute'' (a long walkway marked with flags) that keeps athletes single-file in order of finish and facilitates accurate scoring.\n\nDepending on the timing and scoring system, finish officials may collect a small slip from each runner's bib, to keep track of finishing positions. An alternative method (standard in the UK) is to have four officials in two pairs. In the first pair, one official reads out numbers of finishers and the other records them. In the second pair, one official reads out times for the other to record. At the end of the race, the two lists are joined along with information from the entry information. The primary disadvantage of this system is that distractions can easily upset the results, particularly when scores of runners finish close together.\n\n[[Transponder timing|Chip timing]] has grown in popularity to increase accuracy and decrease the number of officials required at the finish line. Each runner attaches a [[transponder]] with [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] to his or her shoe. When the runner crosses the finish line, an electronic pad records the chip number and matches the runner to a database. Chip timing allows officials to use checkpoint mats throughout the race to calculate split times, and to ensure runners cover the entire course. This is by far the most efficient method, although it is also the most expensive. The drawback to chip timing is its inability to separate a close finish properly. Chips times the feet, when the rule books say it is the torso that counts. It is technically possible for an athlete to fall across the finish line, legally crossing the finish line, but with their feet too far away from the sensor to have their finish recorded.\n\nContemporary races have now started to use [[fully automatic timing]] systems for [[photo finish]] accuracy to their results. This has dramatically improved the timing mechanisms of Cross Country over the last few years.\n\n==Scoring==\nScores are determined by summing the top four or five individual finishing places on each team. In international competition, a team typically consists of six runners, with the top four scoring. In the United States, the most common scoring system is seven runners, with the top five scoring. Points are awarded to the individual runners of eligible teams, equal to the position in which they cross the finish line (first place gets 1 point, second place gets 2 points, etc.). The points for these runners are summed, and the lowest score wins. Individual athletes, and athletes from incomplete teams (teams consisting of less than 5 athletes or teams) and individuals who have been disqualified are excluded from scoring. Ties are usually broken by the position of each team's sixth runner.\n\nThe lowest possible score in a five-to-score match is 15 (1+2+3+4+5), achieved by a team's runners finishing in each of the top five positions. If there is a single opposing team then they would have a score of 40 (6+7+8+9+10), which can be considered a \"sweep\" for the winning team. In some competitions a team's sixth and seventh runner are scored in the overall field and are known as \"pushers\" or \"displacers\" as their place can count ahead of other runners, giving other teams more points. In the above match, if there are two non-scoring runners and they came 6th and 7th overall, the opponent's score would be 50 (8+9+10+11+12). Accordingly, the official score of a forfeited dual meet is 15\u201350.\n\n==Strategy==\nBecause of differences between courses in running surface, frequency and tightness of turns, and amount of up and downhill, cross country [[strategy]] does not necessarily simplify to running a steady pace from start to finish. [[Coach (sport)|Coach]]es and cross country runners debate the relative merits of fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether you run ahead 'of the pack' or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner's individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.<ref>Groves, Harry. ''Tactics & Strategy''.

Most races are run in shorts and vests or singlets, usually in club or school colours. In particularly cold conditions, long-sleeved shirts and tights can be worn to retain warmth without losing mobility. The most common footwear are [[Cross country running shoe|cross country spikes]], lightweight racing shoes with a rubber sole and five or more metal spikes screwed into the forefoot part of the sole. Spike length depends on race conditions, with a muddy course appropriate for spikes as long as {{convert|25|mm|in}}. If a course has a harder surface, spikes as short as {{convert|6|mm|in}} may be most effective. While spikes are suitable for grassy, muddy, or other slippery conditions, runners may choose to wear [[racing flats]], rubber-soled racing shoes without spikes, if the course includes significant portions of paved surfaces or dirt road.<ref name=NFHSRules>2011 NFHS Track & Field and Cross Country Rules Book.

English schools started competing in cross country races in 1837, and established a national championship on December 7, 1867. It was held on [[Wimbledon Common]] in south-west London. It was the first cross country race that was considered \"open\", or could be run by anyone. Its original purpose was to imitate steeplechase for off-season training, and was considered a bit of a joke.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The race was about 3.5 miles long, and went through very boggy and hilly terrain. The course was not well marked, and many competitors got lost. Matters were not helped by the fact that the race was run in the dark, as it began at 5 pm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burfoot|first=Amby|title=Common Ground|journal=Runners World|date=July 2006|volume=92}}</ref>{{MOS|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Olympic Games===\n{{main|Cross country running at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Ind cross country 1924 Summer Olympics.jpg|300px|thumb|Individual cross country race at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

In middle school, races are more serious and are divided by grade and gender. In high school, the races are far-reaching and tend to be the main talent pool (especially at the senior level) for university- or national-level runners. At the university level, the sport is administered by [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].<ref>[http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/xc/ CIS Cross Country Championships]. [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe organization of cross country running in the United Kingdom has continued to be mostly devolved to the four national associations: [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The sport is based around the clubs, which usually are mixed cross country and road running clubs. The [[English Cross Country Association]] is part of the [[Amateur Athletic Association]].\n\nCross country running takes place from roughly September until March. Most matches are parts of different cross country leagues, which are organized on an ''ad hoc'' basis. These vary from large, high quality leagues, such as the [[London Metropolitan Cross Country League]], [[Birmingham]] League, [[Hampshire]] League, Essex League and [[Surrey]] League (which is unusual in requiring ten runners to score) to small, local leagues (such as the [[Gloucestershire]] AA league), and individual clubs can (and typically are) member of several leagues.\n\nTypically there will be four or five fixtures a season. Also, there are county championships, area championships (North, South, and Midlands), the national championship (whose location rotates around the three areas), and the Inter-Counties Championship organised by the [[UK Counties Athletics Union]], where runners compete for their counties and not their clubs.\n\nThere can be many additional inter-club matches, particularly among the older clubs. Most league matches are around {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and most championships 12 to 15&nbsp;km (approximately 7\u00bd to 9 miles) long. Most clubs are mixed, though men's and women's races tend to be run separately.\n\nSecondary school-aged students are also to compete at local schools races, with a set number of students qualifying for county level, at which there is a further race to be eligible for the relevant national schools cross country race (e.g. the English Schools Cross Country).\n\nAt university level, there is considerable competition available. University clubs typically compete both locally (via English Athletics) as well as between universities - with larger fixtures organized through [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]].\n\nPrimary schools, although more often the juniors, also participate in cross country events and some areas of England have done so since the late 1960s. An example would be schools near [[Ouston, County Durham]] which compete as part of Chester-le-Street & District Primary Cross Country Association.<ref>[http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ Chester-le-street schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141808/http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ |date=2012-04-25 }}.

The [[USA Cross Country Championships]], first held in 1890, include six races: masters women (8&nbsp;km), masters men (8&nbsp;km), junior women (6&nbsp;km), junior men (8&nbsp;km), open women (8&nbsp;km) and open men (12&nbsp;km). In addition to crowning national champions, the championships serve as the trials race to select the Team USA squad for the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. The USATF Masters 5&nbsp;km Cross Country Championships, first held in 2002, incl men's race and a women's race.

Over 440,000 high school students compete in cross country each year, making it the sixth-most popular sport for girls, and seventh most popular for boys.<ref>[http://www.nfhs.org National Federation of State High School Associations] [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]].</ref> The standard high school cross country race distance is {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} for most states, with California high schools running 3-mile races, though some counties run a shorter, 3- to 4-kilometer course for girls. Beginning in 1979, the [[Foot Locker Cross Country Championships]] have offered a national championship for high school cross country runners. Since 2004, the [[Nike Cross Nationals]] have offered an alternative national championship, focused on teams rather than individuals. A 2008 film, ''The Long Green Line'', documented the success of Joe Newton, cross country coach at [[York Community High School]] in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1267833/ The Long Green Line (2008) \u2013 IMDb] [[IMDb]].</ref>\n\nWhile many middle schools (grades 6\u20138) in the U.S. offer cross country as a school sport, youth running clubs dominate in this age group.

Few [[elementary school]]s in the U.S. have school teams, but many running clubs exist for youth runners. Youth running clubs compete in local, regional, and national championships sanctioned by the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] or [[USA Track & Field|USATF]]. Course distances for this age group vary depending on the age of the athlete. Common championship distances are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Group\n! Ages\n!

A branch to Salisbury (Midford) from a junction on the main line at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]] (then called Bishopstoke) was opened in 1847. The branch passes through [[Romsey railway station|Romsey]] and the Dean valley; today part of its route forms the [[Eastleigh-Romsey line]].\n\nA more direct route between Southampton and Romsey was adopted in 1865 on completion of the [[Sprat and Winkle Line]] (at first by the Andover and Redbridge Railway, but taken over by the LSWR before completion). This forms the current route of the Wessex Main Line: departing westbound from Southampton Central via [[Millbrook (Hampshire) railway station|Millbrook]] and [[Redbridge railway station|Redbridge]] before branching north to Romsey.\n\n=== North of Salisbury ===\nThe line through Wiltshire and Somerset was completed in stages, after the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (WS&WR) was authorised by Parliament in 1845. The first section to be opened, in 1848, ran from Thingley junction to the west of Chippenham on the [[Great Western Railway]], via Melksham and Trowbridge to [[Westbury railway station|Westbury]].{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=140}} The WS&WR company was unable to fund further construction, and in 1849 the directors decided to sell their line to the GWR.\n\nThe GWR's [[Salisbury branch line (Great Western Railway)|branch to Salisbury]] from Westbury was completed through the Wylye valley in 1856, with the first section, as far as [[Warminster railway station|Warminster]], having been opened in 1851.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=138}}\n\nThe route from a junction near Staverton, north of Trowbridge, to [[Bradford-on-Avon railway station|Bradford-on-Avon]] had been constructed in 1848 but the rails were not laid. This branch, via Bradford then along the Avon valley to join the GWR main line at [[Bathampton railway station|Bathampton]], was completed in 1857.\n\n=== Across Salisbury ===\nFurther work was required at Salisbury to complete the Bristol-Southampton route, as the GWR station was in the west of the city at Fisherton, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} away from the earlier LSWR station at Milford on the southeast side. In 1857 the LSWR's [[West of England line]] (London-Exeter via Basingstoke and Andover) arrived in northeast Salisbury, at first using the Midford station. In 1859 the LSWR opened a new station at Fisherton, immediately south of the GWR station, to serve two lines: the Andover line, which had been extended across the city, and the new [[Salisbury and Yeovil Railway]] towards Exeter. The Milford station was then closed to passengers.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|pp=106-113}}\n\nA [[transit shed]] was opened between the two Fisherton stations in 1860, to allow goods to be transferred between the GWR's broad gauge wagons and the LSWR's standard gauge. Following the conversion of the GWR to standard gauge in 1874, a connecting siding was built in 1878 to allow shunting of wagons. A direct route for passengers came into use with the inauguration of a Cardiff to Portsmouth service in 1896.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=107}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\nAt Salisbury, the LSWR station (which had been expanded in 1878) was further expanded and remodelled, with a large extension to the station building completed in 1902.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|pp=110-112}} The GWR station continued to be used by branch services until it was closed to passengers in 1932; it was used as a goods depot until 1991 and is now part of [[Salisbury TMD|Salisbury Traincare Depot]].{{sfn|Oakley|2004|pp=108-109}} Milford continued as a major goods depot until 1967.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=113}}\n\nWestbury station was rebuilt in 1899 to cater for the [[Stert and Westbury Railway]], opened 1900, which now forms part of the [[Reading-Taunton line]].\n\nOn the Chippenham branch, the halts at Beanacre and [[Broughton Gifford Halt railway station|Broughton Gifford]] closed in 1955.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=14}} The smaller stations on the Salisbury branch \u2013 [[Heytesbury railway station|Heytesbury]], [[Codford railway station|Codford]], [[Wylye railway station|Wylye]] and [[Wilton North railway station|Wilton North]] \u2013 closed to passengers in the same year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol4/pp280-293|title=Victoria County History \u2013 Wiltshire \u2013 Vol 4 pp 280-293: Railways|editor-first=Elizabeth|editor-last=Crittall|date=1959|website=British History Online|publisher=University of London|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> although in most cases goods service continued into the 1960s.

The service was increased again to eight trains each way per day (six northbound and five southbound on Sundays) from December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timetable|url=http://www.twcrp.org.uk/timetable.html|website=TransWilts Community Rail Partnership|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Southampton to Salisbury ===\nThe [[South Western Main Line]] of the [[London and Southampton Railway]], which changed its name to the [[London and South Western Railway]] in 1839, had reached Southampton in 1840. A branch to Salisbury (Midford) from a junction on the main line at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]] (then called Bishopstoke) was opened in 1847. The branch passes through [[Romsey railway station|Romsey]] and the Dean valley; today part of its route forms the [[Eastleigh-Romsey line]].\n\nA more direct route between Southampton and Romsey was adopted in 1865 on completion of the [[Sprat and Winkle Line]] (at first by the Andover and Redbridge Railway, but taken over by the LSWR before completion). This forms the current route of the Wessex Main Line: departing westbound from Southampton Central via [[Millbrook (Hampshire) railway station|Millbrook]] and [[Redbridge railway station|Redbridge]] before branching north to Romsey.\n\n=== North of Salisbury ===\nThe line through Wiltshire and Somerset was completed in stages, after the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (WS&WR) was authorised by Parliament in 1845. The first section to be opened, in 1848, ran from Thingley junction to the west of Chippenham on the [[Great Western Railway]], via Melksham and Trowbridge to [[Westbury railway station|Westbury]].{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=140}} The WS&WR company was unable to fund further construction, and in 1849 the directors decided to sell their line to the GWR.\n\nThe GWR's [[Salisbury branch line (Great Western Railway)|branch to Salisbury]] from Westbury was completed through the Wylye valley in 1856, with the first section, as far as [[Warminster railway station|Warminster]], having been opened in 1851.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=138}}\n\nThe route from a junction near Staverton, north of Trowbridge, to [[Bradford-on-Avon railway station|Bradford-on-Avon]] had been constructed in 1848 but the rails were not laid. This branch, via Bradford then along the Avon valley to join the GWR main line at [[Bathampton railway station|Bathampton]], was completed in 1857.\n\n=== Across Salisbury ===\nFurther work was required at Salisbury to complete the Bristol-Southampton route, as the GWR station was in the west of the city at Fisherton, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} away from the earlier LSWR station at Milford on the southeast side. In 1857 the LSWR's [[West of England line]] (London-Exeter via Basingstoke and Andover) arrived in northeast Salisbury, at first using the Midford station. In 1859 the LSWR opened a new station at Fisherton, immediately south of the GWR station, to serve two lines: the Andover line, which had been extended across the city, and the new [[Salisbury and Yeovil Railway]] towards Exeter. The Milford station was then closed to passengers.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|pp=106-113}}\n\nA [[transit shed]] was opened between the two Fisherton stations in 1860, to allow goods to be transferred between the GWR's broad gauge wagons and the LSWR's standard gauge. Following the conversion of the GWR to standard gauge in 1874, a connecting siding was built in 1878 to allow shunting of wagons. A direct route for passengers came into use with the inauguration of a Cardiff to Portsmouth service in 1896.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=107}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\nAt Salisbury, the LSWR station (which had been expanded in 1878) was further expanded and remodelled, with a large extension to the station building completed in 1902.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|pp=110-112}} The GWR station continued to be used by branch services until it was closed to passengers in 1932; it was used as a goods depot until 1991 and is now part of [[Salisbury TMD|Salisbury Traincare Depot]].{{sfn|Oakley|2004|pp=108-109}} Milford continued as a major goods depot until 1967.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=113}}\n\nWestbury station was rebuilt in 1899 to cater for the [[Stert and Westbury Railway]], opened 1900, which now forms part of the [[Reading-Taunton line]].\n\nOn the Chippenham branch, the halts at Beanacre and [[Broughton Gifford Halt railway station|Broughton Gifford]] closed in 1955.{{sfn|Oakley|2004|p=14}} The smaller stations on the Salisbury branch \u2013 [[Heytesbury railway station|Heytesbury]], [[Codford railway station|Codford]], [[Wylye railway station|Wylye]] and [[Wilton North railway station|Wilton North]] \u2013 closed to passengers in the same year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol4/pp280-293|title=Victoria County History \u2013 Wiltshire \u2013 Vol 4 pp 280-293: Railways|editor-first=Elizabeth|editor-last=Crittall|date=1959|website=British History Online|publisher=University of London|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> although in most cases goods service continued into the 1960s.

Domination}}\n\nThe intensity of the rivalry is fuelled by the clubs' historical duopoly in Scottish football, with most meetings between them being pivotal in deciding the destiny of a championship or cup and anything but a title-winning season seen as a major disappointment, particularly as it would usually mean 'the enemy' has won the trophy.\n\n===League===\n{{See also|List of Scottish football champions}}\n\n[[File:Old Firm pic.PNG|thumb|320px|left|Side-by-side comparison of Celtic's and Rangers' final league positions from 1891\u20132017]]\nStatistics show that Rangers and Celtic have been by far the most successful clubs involved in the [[Scottish Football League]] since its formation in [[1890\u201391 in Scottish football|1890]]. The pair were the only participants in every edition of the competition until [[2011\u201312 in Scottish football|2012]], when Rangers were [[Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc|removed from the top tier for economic reasons]]; they returned for the [[2016\u201317 in Scottish football|2016\u201317]] season. Of the [[List of Scottish football champions|122 championships played]], 104 (85%) have been won by one of the Old Firm with Rangers ahead on 54 titles to Celtic's 50, and 19 between ten other clubs (including a shared title between Rangers and [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]).\n\nAlthough there have been brief periods when silverware went elsewhere, there have also been long spells of domination by each Old Firm club, the longest run of 9-in-a-row being first set by Celtic between [[1966\u201367 in Scottish football|1966]] and [[1973\u201374 in Scottish football|1974]], matched by Rangers between [[1988\u201389 in Scottish football|1989]] and [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1997]].\n\nOn just five occasions since 1891 have neither of the Glasgow giants been the league winner nor the runner-up. This includes [[1964\u201365 in Scottish football|1964\u201365]], the only season in which both Rangers and Celtic failed to finish in the top three places. The Old Firm have finished 1st and 2nd 48 times overall. Between the [[History of Celtic F.C. (1994\u2013present)#The Fergus McCann era (1994\u20131999)|resurgence of Celtic in the mid-1990s]] and the liquidation of Rangers in 2012, '1\u20132' finishes were recorded in all but one of 17 ''[[Scottish Premier League#Old Firm dominance|SPL]]-era'' seasons.\n\nThe longest sequence without an Old Firm title is three years between [[1982\u201383 in Scottish football|1983]] and [[1984\u201385 in Scottish football|1985]], while the longest unbroken run of championships between the two clubs began immediately afterwards and is ongoing: 33 seasons and counting since [[1985\u201386 in Scottish football|1986]] (overtaking a previous sequence of 27 years between [[1904\u201305 in Scottish football|1905]] and [[1930\u201331 in Scottish football|1931]]).\n\n''As of end of the [[2018\u201319 in Scottish football|2018\u201319]] season.

Those involved expressed their anger afterwards regarding the arrangements and the policing at the stadium on the day, with Celtic issuing an official apology to the fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45396058 |title=Celtic apologise to fans after crush incident before Old Firm game |work=[[BBC News]] |date=3 September 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fans-demand-probe-terrifying-13183745 |title=Celtic fans demand probe into terrifying crush before Rangers game to ensure it never happens again |work=Daily Record |date=3 September 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16686313.celtic-park-crush-dad-takes-traumatised-son-15-to-hospital/ |title=Celtic Park \u2018crush\u2019: Dad takes traumatised son, 15, to hospital |work=Evening Times |date=4 September 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Legislation===\nFrom 1 March 2012, the police were given more powers to act against Sectarian acts at football matches through the new [[Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012]]. The law was designed specifically to target the Old Firm rivalry by reducing the religious hatred between the two opposing sides.<ref name=eternal/> The Act created two new offences, one covering behaviour in and around football matches and the other related to posts sent by either electronic or postal methods. People convicted under the act could face up to five years imprisonment, a much higher sentence than was previously in place. It was hoped it would make it much easier to prosecute this misbehaviour, which had proved difficult in the past.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20205917 |title=New sectarian law hailed a success by Lord Advocate |work=BBC News |date=5 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2013 a protest by a number of Celtic fans took place to protest against the new laws and the subsequent match bans that a number of fans had received for breaking the Act. The protesters, known as the \"[[Green Brigade]],\" had marched without police authority and the event was therefore cracked down on by local authorities resulting in thirteen arrests. The protestors claim that the police instigated the trouble that occurred at this march.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-21813699 |title=Arrests made as Green Brigade protest is broken up |work=BBC News |date=16 March 2013}}</ref> Following the march, media coverage reported that the fans were growing further apart from the police than ever before. They claimed that the trust the fans hold with the police to work in cooperation with them is falling dramatically. The march that took place resulted in a number of complaints from both Celtic and Rangers fan groups that they were harassed by the police.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21849341 |title=Old Firm fans in danger of 'losing trust in police', say MSPs |work=[[BBC News]] |date=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nLabour MSP [[James Kelly (Scottish politician)|James Kelly]] introduced the ''Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Repeal) (Scotland) Bill'' in June 2017.

have been by far the most successful clubs involved in the [[Scottish Football League]] since its formation in [[1890\u201391 in Scottish football|1890]]. The pair were the only participants in every edition of the competition until [[2011\u201312 in Scottish football|2012]], when Rangers were [[Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc|removed from the top tier for economic reasons]]; they returned for the [[2016\u201317 in Scottish football|2016\u201317]] season. Of the [[List of Scottish football champions|122 championships played]], 104 (85%) have been won by one of the Old Firm with Rangers ahead on 54 titles to Celtic's 50, and 19 between ten other clubs (including a shared title between Rangers and [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]).\n\nAlthough there have been brief periods when silverware went elsewhere, there have also been long spells of domination by each Old Firm club, the longest run of 9-in-a-row being first set by Celtic between [[1966\u201367 in Scottish football|1966]] and [[1973\u201374 in Scottish football|1974]], matched by Rangers between [[1988\u201389 in Scottish football|1989]] and [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1997]].\n\nOn just five occasions since 1891 have neither of the Glasgow giants been the league winner nor the runner-up. This includes [[1964\u201365 in Scottish football|1964\u201365]], the only season in which both Rangers and Celtic failed to finish in the top three places.
