If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitute membership in the unreported economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12methods.pdf|title=Internal Revenue Service Summary of Estimation Methods|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"feige\">{{cite book|author=Edgar L.

These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate.

A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the \"[[tax gap]]\", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a \"tax gap\" of $450\u2013$600 billion.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the \"Tax Gap\" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe \"unrecorded economy\" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.<ref name=\"Feige 2016\"/> A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not.

The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.\n* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.\n\n==Consumer issues==\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|No government, no global nonprofit, no multinational enterprise can seriously claim to be able to replace the 1.8 billion jobs created by the economic underground.

Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is $321.6 billion USD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |title=World Drug Report 2005 |work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAlthough law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price.

These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.\n\nIn England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration\u2014convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.\n\n===Illegally logged timber===\n{{Main|Illegal logging}}\nThe illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue.

Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land.

But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high.

An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].\nRacketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.<ref>David Witwer, \"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\", in {{cite book |first2=William Chester, Ed. |last2=Jordan |title=Corrupt histories |location=Rochester, New York |first1=Emmanuel, Ed. |last1=Kreike |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58046-173-3}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation providers===\n{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}\nWhere taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service<ref name=\"Baltimore\"/> for city residents.\n\n===Housing rental===\nIn places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011</ref> In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010</ref> either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner.

A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.\n\nCopyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |title=Is music piracy stealing? |author=Charles W.

It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.\n\nThe comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal \"[[mixtape]]s\" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job.

This may happen for one or more of several reasons:\n* The government sets (\"pegs\") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.\n* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.\n* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).\n* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].\n* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |work=PBS Frontline |author1=Oriana Zill |author2=Lowell Bergman |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nA government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the \"harder\" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.\n\nIn situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency. The U.S. dollar is viewed as a relatively stable and safe currency and is often used abroad as a second currency. In 2012, $340 billion, roughly 37 percent<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Edgar L.

See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIf foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.<ref name=\"Cebula and Feige\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nMore recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions.

This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that \u00a3350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.\n\n===Sex toys===\nThere are some countries where sex toys are illegal, such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand and India. The illegality has omitted certain clearing processes such as safety testing when they are sold by undercover independent vendors on the black market. Other black market platforms used to sell sex toys on the black market include consumer-to-consumer online auction websites, as well as private pages on social media websites.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/43936/1/the-fight-to-legalise-sex-toys-in-thailand-bangkok |title = The fight to legalise sex toys in Thailand|date = April 5, 2019}}</ref> In black market venues in Cambodia, sex toys have been seized alongside aphrodisiac products.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypa7mg/meeting-a-dildo-dealer-in-cambodia-where-sex-toys-are-illegal |title = Meeting a Dildo Dealer in Cambodia, Where Sex Toys Are Illegal|date = October 6, 2015}}</ref> Some analysts have argued that if efforts in North America to ban realistic-looking [[sexbot]]s succeed, it may result in a black market trade in sexbots.<ref>Klein, Wilhelm EJ, and Vivian Wenli Lin. \"Sex robots revisited: A reply to the campaign against sex robots.\" ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society 47.4 (2018): 107-121</ref>\n\n==Organized crime==\n{{Main|Organized crime}}\nPeople engaged in the black market usually run their business hidden under a [[Front organization|front]] business that is legal.\n\nOften, certain types of illegal products are traded against one another, depending on the geographical location.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/ff_orgchart_crime/|title=Organized Crime: The World's Largest Social Network|issue=2|journal=WIRED|volume=19|accessdate=September 14, 2014|date=2011-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\n===Wars===\nBlack markets flourish in most countries during [[war]]time. States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.<ref name=\"TheHomeFront\">{{cite book |title=The Home Front|date=July 1945|isbn=978-1-904897-11-8|publisher=Imperial War Museum|location=London|edition=facsimile}}</ref> One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened. Another in Britain was supplies from the US, intended only for use in US army bases on British land, but leaked into the local native British black market.\n\nFor example, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on February 17, 1945,<ref>''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' February 17, 1945, reprinted on page 30 ''The Daily Telegraph'' February 17, 2015</ref> [[Member of parliament|members]] said that \"the whole [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] production of [[East Anglia]] had gone to the black market\" and \"prosecutions [for black-marketing] were like trying to stop a leak in a battleship\", and it was said that official prices of such foods were set so low that their producers often sold their produce on the black market for higher prices; one such route (seen to operate at the market at [[Diss]] in Norfolk) was to sell live poultry to members of the public, and each purchaser would sign a form promising that he was buying the birds to breed from, and then take them home for eating.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam war]], American soldiers would spend [[Military Payment Certificate]]s on [[maid]] service and [[Human sexuality|sexual]] entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Also if a Vietnamese civilian wanted something that was hard to get, he would buy it at double the price from one of the soldiers, who had a monthly ration card and thus had access to the military stores.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The transactions ran through the on-base maids to the local populace. Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Laws and regulations===\nA classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[prohibition]] of alcohol.

If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitute membership in the unreported economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12methods.pdf|title=Internal Revenue Service Summary of Estimation Methods|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"feige\">{{cite book|author=Edgar L.

These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate. Four major underground economies can be identified:<ref name=Feige /><ref name=\"Feige 2016\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the \"Shadow Economy\"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}</ref>\n\n# the illegal economy\n# the unreported economy\n# the unrecorded economy\n# the informal economy\n\nThe \"illegal economy\" consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce.

A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the \"[[tax gap]]\", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a \"tax gap\" of $450\u2013$600 billion.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the \"Tax Gap\" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe \"unrecorded economy\" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.<ref name=\"Feige 2016\"/> A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not.

The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.\n* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.\n\n==Consumer issues==\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|No government, no global nonprofit, no multinational enterprise can seriously claim to be able to replace the 1.8 billion jobs created by the economic underground.

In countries such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]], where prostitution is legal but regulated, illegal prostitutes exist whose services are offered cheaper without regard for the legal requirements or procedures\u2014health checks, standards of accommodation, and so on.\n\nIn other countries, such as [[Nicaragua]], where legal prostitution is regulated, hotels may require both parties to identify themselves, to prevent the rise of [[child prostitution]].\n\n===Personal information===\n[[Personally identifying information]], financial information like credit card and bank account information, and [[Medical data breach|medical data]] is bought and sold, mostly in [[darknet market]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holt |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Smirnova |first2=Olga |last3=Chua |first3=Yi-Ting |title=Data thieves in action : examining the international market for stolen personal information |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-58904-0}}</ref> People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rossi |first1=Ben |title=The ripple effect of identity theft: What happens to my data once it's stolen?|url=https://www.information-age.com/ripple-effect-identity-theft-what-happens-my-data-once-its-stolen-123459795/ |work=Information Age |date=8 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Illegal drugs===\n[[File:Yellow Cannabis strain.jpg|thumb|left|In the U.S., [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] has been termed as a [[cash crop]].]]\n{{Main|Illegal drug trade}}\nFrom the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries began to ban the keeping or using of some [[recreational drug]]s, such as the United States' [[war on drugs]]. Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is $321.6 billion USD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |title=World Drug Report 2005 |work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAlthough law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price.

These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.\n\nIn England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration\u2014convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.\n\n===Illegally logged timber===\n{{Main|Illegal logging}}\nThe illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue.

Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land.

But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high.

Conducting a racket is racketeering.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering|title= Racketeering|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, although that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].\nRacketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.<ref>David Witwer, \"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\", in {{cite book |first2=William Chester, Ed. |last2=Jordan |title=Corrupt histories |location=Rochester, New York |first1=Emmanuel, Ed. |last1=Kreike |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58046-173-3}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation providers===\n{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}\nWhere taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service<ref name=\"Baltimore\"/> for city residents.\n\n===Housing rental===\nIn places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011</ref> In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010</ref> either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner.

A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.\n\nCopyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |title=Is music piracy stealing? |author=Charles W.

It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.\n\nThe comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal \"[[mixtape]]s\" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job.

This may happen for one or more of several reasons:\n* The government sets (\"pegs\") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.\n* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.\n* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).\n* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].\n* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |work=PBS Frontline |author1=Oriana Zill |author2=Lowell Bergman |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nA government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the \"harder\" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.\n\nIn situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency.

See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIf foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.<ref name=\"Cebula and Feige\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nMore recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions.

This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that \u00a3350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.\n\n===Sex toys===\nThere are some countries where sex toys are illegal, such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand and India. The illegality has omitted certain clearing processes such as safety testing when they are sold by undercover independent vendors on the black market.

States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.<ref name=\"TheHomeFront\">{{cite book |title=The Home Front|date=July 1945|isbn=978-1-904897-11-8|publisher=Imperial War Museum|location=London|edition=facsimile}}</ref> One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened.

Also if a Vietnamese civilian wanted something that was hard to get, he would buy it at double the price from one of the soldiers, who had a monthly ration card and thus had access to the military stores.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The transactions ran through the on-base maids to the local populace. Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Laws and regulations===\nA classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[prohibition]] of alcohol.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is the sequel to ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the third film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July of 2009, mostly in [[California]] like the first film except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]]. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Iron Man suits.\n\n''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews for Downey's performance as well as the action sequences, musical score, and visual effects, but many critics deemed it to be inferior to the first film and criticized the villain and pacing. The sequel grossed over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A third installment of the series, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father, [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" />}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.\n\nLater, Stark learns that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] as CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits [[suicide]] by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = Downey, Johansson and Rockwell promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr SDCC 2009 3.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Scarlett Johansson SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Sam Rockwell SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| align = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man\u2013' that he's now really wondering what that means. If you have all this cushion like he does and the public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power, I think he's way too insulated to be okay.\"<ref name=\"DowneyComicCon\" /> Downey put on 20 pounds of muscle to reprise the role.<ref name=\"DowneyMuscle\" /> Six-year-old Davin Ransom portrays Tony Stark as a child.<ref name=\"RansomYoungStark\" />\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Pepper Potts]]: <br />Stark's closest friend, budding love interest, and business partner; Pepper is promoted to CEO of Stark Industries.<ref name=\"ew-cover\" /> On her character's promotion, Paltrow opined \"When we start ''Iron Man 2'' Pepper and Tony are very much in the same vibe... as the movie progresses, Pepper is given more responsibility and she's promoted and it's nice to see her sort of grow up in that way.

And the common denominator was really his friendship with Tony, and that's what we really tried to track in this one.

Can I run in it? Can I like throw myself over things with this?' And I think just the prep, you just have to put in the hours.

After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''. Millar argued the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.<ref name=\"MarkMillar\" /> Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in ''[[Star Wars]]'' you had the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but [[Darth Vader]] is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. You just can't do it.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarWars\" /> Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.<ref name=\"chat\" />\n\nDuring development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the '[[Demon in a Bottle]]' version\".<ref name=\"chat\" /> While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend.<ref name=\"black\" /> Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc.<ref name=\"et\" /> [[Shane Black]] gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], who became depressed with being \"the destroyer of worlds\" after working on the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name=\"black\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nImmediately following ''Iron Man''{{'}}s release, Marvel Studios announced that they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010.<ref name=\"MarvelAnnouncesIM2\" /> In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct.<ref name=\"FavreauSignsIM2\" /> That same month, [[Justin Theroux]] signed to write the script, which would be based on a story written by Favreau and Downey.<ref name=\"TherouxWriting\" /> Theroux co-wrote ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'', which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel.<ref name=\"TherouxNov2008\" /> [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] [[storyboard]]ed the film,<ref name=\"Tartakovsky\" /> and [[Adi Granov]] returned to supervise the designs for [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Iron Man's armor]].<ref name=\"chat\" />\n\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios came to an agreement to film ''Iron Man 2'', as well as their next three films, at Raleigh Studios in [[Manhattan Beach, California]].<ref name=\"FilmingRaleigh\" /> A few days later, Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard.<ref name=\"CheadleReplaces\" /> On being replaced, Howard stated, \"There was no explanation, apparently the contracts that we write and sign aren't worth the paper that they're printed on sometimes. Promises aren't kept, and good faith negotiations aren't always held up.\"<ref name=\"HowardInterview\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard, often re-shooting and cutting his scenes; Howard's publicist said he had a good experience playing the part, while Marvel chose not to comment. As Favreau and Theroux chose to reduce the role, Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary\u2014Howard was the first actor hired in ''Iron Man'' and was paid the largest salary. The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating.<ref name=\"EWHoward\" /> Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated.<ref name=\"TherouxNov2008\" /> In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, \"with or without you,\" and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey \"took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.\"<ref name=\"HowardInterview2\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains.<ref name=\"RourkeRockwell\" /> A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer.<ref name=\"RockwellAccepts\" /> Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.<ref name=\"BettanyJARVIS\" /> Marvel entered into early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play the Black Widow,<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson claimed that \"There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury.\"<ref name=\"SLJJanuaryDispute\" />\n\nIn February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.<ref name=\"SLJSignsOn\" /> Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable discussion with [[David Ansen]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards|2009 Golden Globes]], and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out due to Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March, Rourke signed on.<ref name=\"RourkeCast\" /> Later that same day, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In April, Garry Shandling,<ref name=\"Shandling\" /> Clark Gregg,<ref name=\"GreggMara\" /> and [[Kate Mara]]<ref name=\"GreggMara\" /> joined the cast.\n\n===Filming===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=\"This is one of the richest men in the world, so we can't buy our practicals from Home Depot.

Snow described the process of digitally creating the suits:\n{{quote|text=On the first ''Iron Man'', we tried to use the Legacy [Studios, [[Stan Winston]]'s effects company] and Stan Winston suits as much as we could. For the second one, Jon [Favreau] was confident we could create the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] suits, and the action dictated using them. So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene. But in the rest of the film, we used the CG suit entirely. And [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] did an all-digital suit for the Monaco chase.<ref name=\"ILMBenSnow\"/>}}\n\nILM created 527 shots for the film, using programs such as [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]].<ref name=\"Autodesk\"/> Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film.<ref name=\"PerceptionNYC\"/> They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent [[LG Corp|LG]] [[smartphone]],<ref name=\"IM2Gadgets\"/> and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo as well as the computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the holographic lab environment.<ref name=\"PerceptionNYC\"/> In total, 11 visual effect studios worked on the film.<ref name=\"JanekSirrs\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Iron Man 2 (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nA soundtrack album featuring [[AC/DC]] was released by [[Columbia Records]] on April 19, 2010,<ref name=\"ACDC\" /> in at least three different versions: basic, special and deluxe.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is the sequel to ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the third film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July of 2009, mostly in [[California]] like the first film except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]]. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Iron Man suits.\n\n''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews for Downey's performance as well as the action sequences, musical score, and visual effects, but many critics deemed it to be inferior to the first film and criticized the villain and pacing. The sequel grossed over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A third installment of the series, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father, [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" />}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.\n\nLater, Stark learns that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] as CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits [[suicide]] by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = Downey, Johansson and Rockwell promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr SDCC 2009 3.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Scarlett Johansson SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Sam Rockwell SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| align = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man\u2013' that he's now really wondering what that means.

And the common denominator was really his friendship with Tony, and that's what we really tried to track in this one. How is their friendship impacted once Tony comes out and owns 'I am Iron Man'?\".<ref name=\"CheadleComicCon\" /> Cheadle said his suit was {{convert|50|lb|disp=flip}} of metal, and that he could not touch his face while wearing it.<ref name=\"CheadleSuitWeight\" /> Cheadle signed a six-picture deal.<ref name=\"CheadleAVClub\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]]: <br />An undercover spy for S.H.I.E.L.D. posing as Stark's new assistant. Johansson dyed her hair red before she landed the part, hoping that it would help convince Favreau that she was right for the role.<ref name=\"JohanssonRedHair\" /> On why she chose the role, Johansson said, \"the Black Widow character resonated with me... [She] is a superhero, but she's also human. She's small, but she's strong... She is dark and has faced death so many times that she has a deep perspective on the value of life... It's hard not to admire her.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2015\" /> She stated that she had \"a bit of a freak-out moment\" when she first saw the cat-suit.<ref name=\"JohanssonComicCon\" /> When asked about fighting in the costume, Johansson responded \"a big part of me is like 'can I move in this? Can I run in it? Can I like throw myself over things with this?' And I think just the prep, you just have to put in the hours. That's what I realized is that just putting in the hours and doing the training and repetition and basically just befriending the stunt team and spending all day, every day, just over and over and over and over until you sell it.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonComicCon\" />\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Justin Hammer]]: <br />A rival weapons manufacturer. Sam Rockwell was considered for the role of Tony Stark in the first film, and he accepted the role of Hammer without reading the script.<ref name=\"RockwellAccepts\" /> He had never heard of the character before he was contacted about the part, and was unaware Hammer is an old Englishman in the comics.<ref name=\"RockwellRole\" /> Rockwell said, \"I worked with Jon Favreau on this film called ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. And Justin Theroux, who wrote the script, is an old friend of mine, they sort of cooked up this idea and pitched it to [[Kevin Feige]]. What they did, they were maybe going to do one villain like they did with [[Jeff Bridges]], but then they decided to split the villains.

Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]]: <br />Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.; Jackson signed a nine-film contract to play the character.<ref name=\"SLJSignsOn\" /> On the subject of his character not seeing any action in the film, Jackson said \"We still haven't moved Nick Fury into the bad-ass zone.

[[John Slattery]] appears as Tony's father [[Howard Stark]]<ref name=\"SlatteryHoward\" /> and [[Garry Shandling]] appears as United States Senator Stern, who wants Stark to give Iron Man's armor to the government.<ref name=\"Shandling\" /> Favreau stated that Shandling's character was named after radio personality [[Howard Stern]].<ref name=\"BabaBooey\" /> [[Paul Bettany]] again voices Stark's computer, [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]]<ref name=\"BettanyJARVIS\" /> [[Olivia Munn]] originally appeared as an unnamed character who was subsequently cut from the film.

This was [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] made as the introduction of a young [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], Feige and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' director [[Jon Watts]].<ref name=\"PeterParker\" /><ref name=\"PeterParker2\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Jon Favreau at Edwards Air Force Base.JPG|thumb|right|Jon Favreau meeting with members of the U.S. Air Force while filming at Edwards Air Force Base]]\nJon Favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man,<ref name=\"Eric Vespe\" /> with Obadiah Stane ([[Jeff Bridges]]) becoming [[Iron Monger]] during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''. Millar argued the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.<ref name=\"MarkMillar\" /> Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in ''[[Star Wars]]'' you had the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but [[Darth Vader]] is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. You just can't do it.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarWars\" /> Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.<ref name=\"chat\" />\n\nDuring development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the '[[Demon in a Bottle]]' version\".<ref name=\"chat\" /> While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend.<ref name=\"black\" /> Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc.<ref name=\"et\" /> [[Shane Black]] gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on [[J.

Promises aren't kept, and good faith negotiations aren't always held up.\"<ref name=\"HowardInterview\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard, often re-shooting and cutting his scenes; Howard's publicist said he had a good experience playing the part, while Marvel chose not to comment. As Favreau and Theroux chose to reduce the role, Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary\u2014Howard was the first actor hired in ''Iron Man'' and was paid the largest salary. The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating.<ref name=\"EWHoward\" /> Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated.<ref name=\"TherouxNov2008\" /> In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, \"with or without you,\" and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey \"took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.\"<ref name=\"HowardInterview2\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains.<ref name=\"RourkeRockwell\" /> A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer.<ref name=\"RockwellAccepts\" /> Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.<ref name=\"BettanyJARVIS\" /> Marvel entered into early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play the Black Widow,<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson claimed that \"There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury.\"<ref name=\"SLJJanuaryDispute\" />\n\nIn February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.<ref name=\"SLJSignsOn\" /> Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable discussion with [[David Ansen]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards|2009 Golden Globes]], and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out due to Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March, Rourke signed on.<ref name=\"RourkeCast\" /> Later that same day, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In April, Garry Shandling,<ref name=\"Shandling\" /> Clark Gregg,<ref name=\"GreggMara\" /> and [[Kate Mara]]<ref name=\"GreggMara\" /> joined the cast.\n\n===Filming===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=\"This is one of the richest men in the world, so we can't buy our practicals from Home Depot.

So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene.

It is based on [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]]' [[social experiment]] [[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave]] and [[Todd Strasser]]'s novel, ''[[The Wave (novel)|The Wave]]''. The film was produced by [[Christian Becker]] for [[Rat Pack Filmproduktion]]. It was successful in German cinemas, and after ten weeks, 2.3 million people had watched it.\n\n==Plot==\nA school teacher of history, Rainer Wenger, is forced to teach a class on [[autocracy]], despite being an [[Anarchy|anarchist]]. When his students, third generation after the [[World War II|Second World War]],<ref>Jeff Dawson ''...salutes a hit German film ...'' ''[[Sunday Times]]'' 31 Aug 2008</ref> do not believe that a dictatorship could be established in modern Germany, he starts an experiment to demonstrate how easily the masses can be manipulated. He begins by demanding that all students address him as \"Herr Wenger\", as opposed to Rainer,<ref>Note: This is actually the usual way for German students to address teachers. In itself, it is not specifically authoritarian; in this case, it means that Rainer Wenger had ''before'' been a highly unusally informal teacher who changes that policy now.</ref> and places students with poor grades beside students with good grades\u2014purportedly so they can learn from one another and become better as a whole. When speaking, they must stand and give short, direct answers. Wenger shows his students the effect of marching together in the same rhythm, motivating them by suggesting that they could really annoy the anarchy class, which is below them. Wenger suggests a uniform, to remove class distinction and further unite the group. Mona argues it will remove individuality, as well. Karo shows up to class without the uniform and is ostracized. The students decide among themselves they need a name, deciding on \"Die Welle\" (The Wave). Karo suggests another name, which ends up with one single vote cast by herself.\n\nThe group is shown to grow closer and the bully Simon is shown to reform, protecting a classmate from other bullies. He also creates a distinctive salute for the group. Karo and Mona protest the actions of the group, and Mona, disgusted with how her classmates are embracing [[fascism]], leaves the project group. The other classmates don't see her departure as a connection with fascism and continue attending. The members of The Wave begin spray-painting their logo around town at night, having parties where only Wave members are allowed to attend, and ostracizing and tormenting anyone not in their group. Tim becomes very attached to the group, having finally become an accepted member of a social group. He burns his brand clothes, after a discussion about how large corporations do not take responsibility for their actions.\n\nA pair of punks start a fight with Tim, but he is saved by Bomber and Sinan and starts to bond with them. When Tim and his group of new friends are confronted by a group of angry punks (including those that Tim faced previously), Tim pulls a [[Walther PP]] pistol, causing them to back down. Tim explains to his shocked friends that the pistol only fires blanks. Tim later shows up at Wenger's house, offering to be his bodyguard. Wenger declines his offer but invites Tim in for dinner. This puts further strain on Wenger's already tense relationship with his wife, Anke, who thinks his experiment has gone too far. Wenger finally ejects Tim from his house, only to find in the morning that the boy had slept on his doorstep. Anke is upset upon learning of this, and tells Wenger to stop the experiment immediately. He accuses her of being jealous and insults her dependency on pills to be able to show up to work. Shocked, she leaves him, saying The Wave has made him a bad person.\n\nKaro continues her opposition to The Wave, earning the anger of many in the group, who ask her boyfriend, Marco, to do something about it. A water polo competition is due that day, and Wenger asks The Wave to show up in support of the team. Karo and Mona, denied entry to the competition by members of The Wave, sneak in another way to distribute anti-Wave fliers. Members of The Wave notice this and scramble to retrieve the papers before anybody reads them. In the chaos, Sinan starts a fight with an opposing team member, the two almost drowning each other. Members of The Wave in the stands begin to violently shove one another. After the match, Marco confronts Karo and accuses her of causing the fight. She replies that The Wave has brainwashed him completely, and he slaps Karo, causing her to get a nosebleed. Unsettled by his own behavior, Marco approaches Wenger and asks him to stop the project. Wenger agrees and calls a rally for The Wave members for the following day in the school's auditorium.\n\nOnce in the rally, Wenger has the doors locked and begins whipping the students into a fervor. When Marco protests, Wenger calls him a traitor and orders the students to bring him to the stage for punishment. Wenger uses this to test the students to see how extreme the Wave has become. Wenger declares he is disbanding the Wave, but Dennis argues that they should try to salvage the good parts of the movement. Wenger points out that there is no way to remove the negative elements from fascism. Tim draws a gun and refuses to accept the Wave is over, fearing that he will once more be lonely and states that the Wave is his life. When Bomber says the gun only fires blanks, Tim shoots him to prove the pistol has live rounds. Wenger tries to calm Tim, who is now aiming the gun at him. When Tim demands why he shouldn't shoot Wenger too, Wenger says that without him, there would be no one to lead The Wave. Tim abruptly shoots himself instead, preferring to commit suicide rather than go on living without The Wave. Wenger cradles his corpse and looks helplessly at his now traumatized students. The film ends with Wenger being arrested by the police and driven away, Bomber being taken away to the hospital, and Marco and Karo being re-united. The final images show Wenger in the back of a police car, staring into the camera overcome with distress.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Vogel]] as Rainer Wenger, the teacher who started the experiment with his class.\n* [[Frederick Lau]] as Tim, an [[emotional insecurity|insecure]], mentally unstable student who has had problems with his family.

The [[Stanford prison experiment]] of 1971 was adapted for the 2001 production ''[[Das Experiment]]'' by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and the 2015 production directed by [[Kyle Patrick Alvarez]], ''[[The Stanford Prison Experiment (film)|The Stanford Prison Experiment]]''. Gansel's Wave is based on teacher Ron Jones's [[The Third Wave (experiment)|\"Third Wave\" experiment]], which took place at a Californian school in 1967. Because his students did not understand how something like [[Nazism|national socialism]] could even happen, he founded a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], strictly-organized \"movement\" with harsh punishments that was led by him autocratically. The intricate sense of community led to a wave of enthusiasm not only from his own students, but also from students from other classes who joined the program later. Jones later admitted to having enjoyed having his students as followers. To eliminate the upcoming momentum, Jones aborted the project on the fifth day and showed the students the parallels towards the Nazi youth movements.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\">Christa Hanetseder: ''Lehrer gegen Vorurteile.

In: ''Hamburger Abendblatt'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 3</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Jones published a narrative based on those experiences titled \"[[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave]]\", which was made into a television movie of the same title in 1981. In the same year, Morton Rhue published his book \"The Wave\", which was published in Germany in 1984 and has since enjoyed great success as a school literature text. It has sold a total of over 2.5 million copies.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\"/><ref name=\"Jung\" /><ref name=\"StZ\">Ina Hochreuther: ''Die Schule und die Diktatur'' In: ''Stuttgarter Zeitung'', 13.

M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 15</ref> The story has also influenced many plays and role plays worldwide.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\"/><ref name=\"Jung\"/>\n\nThe [[screenplay]] is based on an article written by Ron Jones in which he talks about the experiment and how he remembers it. The rights to the story which belonged to [[Sony]] were given over to Dennis Gansel for the production of a German movie.<ref name=\"DG_HA\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit dem ''Hamburger Abendblatt'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 3: ''\u201eAn den psychologischen Mechanismen hat sich nichts ge\u00e4ndert\u201c''</ref> As a consequence, Morton Rhue whose novel popularized the material in Germany and the publisher Ravensburg did not receive direct revenues from the film project.<ref name=\"FR_13-3-08\">Daniel Kothenschulte: ''Der freie Wille'' In: ''Frankfurter Rundschau'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 33</ref> Gansel was working on the book for one year until he asked [[:de:Peter Thorwarth|Peter Thorwarth]] to join him as a co-author. The screenplay moves the experiment, which was carried out in [[California]] in the 1960s, to present day Germany. The specific location is never mentioned explicitly as it stands for [[Germany]] as a whole. Gansel explained that he did not intend to reenact Jones\u2019 experiment, but rather show how it would be carried out in present-day Germany. He said the movie is not an adaption and that he changed characters, dialogues as well as the beginning and ending of the movie.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> This also includes subsidiary aspects such as the [[football team]] which was turned into a water polo team in the German version whose coach, as opposed to the original, is the teacher himself. The major difference, however, concerns the physical violence and the bloody end which became part of the movie. Nonetheless, Gansel claimed in an interview that it was extremely important to him to ensure that his movie would not differ as much from the experiment as Rhue's book. Thereby he described Jones, who supported the film project as a counselor, as a \"living certificate of authenticity\u201c and that the ending was inspired by the [[Emsdetten school shooting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoutsiderarg.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/dennis-gansel-riding-on-the-crest-of-the-wave/|title=Dennis Gansel riding on the crest of the wave|date=4 February 2013|publisher=}}</ref> He claimed that Jones does not like the way the characters in Rhue's novel are depicted.<ref name=\"DG_Cinema\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit ''Cinema'', Nr.&nbsp;4/2008, S. 36</ref> The former teacher commented that Gansel's movie gave an \"incredibly convincing\u201c account of the actual experiment.<ref name=\"Jung\"/>\n\nAccording to Gansel, representatives of the [[Bavaria]]n film-funding agency which were initially inquired to fund the film project declined because they compared it to Rhue's novel. Furthermore, they criticized that the teacher lacked a clear anti-authoritarian position in the submitted script. The entire project was jeopardized and the first film-funding agency to grant financial aid was the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg. Afterwards, the [[:de:Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|German Federal Film Board]] (FFA) and the [[:de:Deutscher Filmf\u00f6rderfonds|German Federal Film Fund]] (DFFF) as well as other co-producers decided to subsidize the project. [[Constantin Film]] also became one of the sponsors and further managed the film's distribution. The overall budget of the movie amounts to 4,5 million euros and the movie was shot within 38 days.\n\n==Important concepts of the movie==\n\n===Gansel\u2019s concept===\nAccording to [[Dennis Gansel]], German students have grown tired of the topic concerning the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Gansel himself had felt an oversaturation during his schooldays and had developed an emotional connection to this chapter of German history only after watching the film ''[[Schindler's List]]''.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> One difference between the experiment conducted at the time in the [[United States]] and today's [[Germany]] he saw in the fact that the American students had asked themselves quite horrified how there could even exist something like the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. His film, however, was made on the premise that people felt immune to the possibility of a repetition of history as a result of the intensive study of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and its mechanisms. \u201cTherein lies the great danger. It is an interesting fact that we always believe that what happens to others would never happen to us. We blame others, for example the less educated or the [[East Germany|East Germans]] etc. However, in the Third Reich the house caretaker was just as fascinated by the movement as was the intellectual.\u201d<ref name=\"DG_Standard\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit ''Der Standard'', 11. Februar 2008, S. 28: ''Faschismus ist f\u00fcr alle anziehend''</ref>\n\nThe small town the movie is set in is prosperous and does not show any salient social or economic problems and the teacher practices a liberal lifestyle. [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] is convinced that the plot gains a broader psychological validity by the choice of such a location.  \u201cEveryone thinks they would have been [[Anne Frank]]s and [[Sophie Scholl]]s in [[Nazi Germany]]. In my opinion this is complete nonsense. I would say that biographies of resistance rather originate in coincidences,\u201d claims Gansel. He then explains that, for example, Karo's political awareness and opposition arise out of vanity: she does not like the white shirt.<ref name=\"DG_StN\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit den ''Stuttgarter Nachrichten'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 12: ''\u201eWiderstandsbiografien entstehen aus Zuf\u00e4llen\u201c''</ref> In the past Gansel had been sure that he would have been part of the resistance but while working on The Wave he realized how \u201cnon-politically\u201d the conversion of people took place.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> He remarks that every human being has the need for belonging to a group.\n\nHe says he does not believe that films are capable of having a greater political impact on the viewers and that a film can only influence people who were already sensitized to the topic presented. In his opinion films can at best stimulate discussions, but to be able to do that they have to be really entertaining. \u201cIn Germany there has always existed the great misunderstanding that politics in the world of cinema were synonymous with boredom,\u201d says Gansel. He claims that in between high-brow cinema, as films by [[Christian Petzold (director)|Christian Petzold]], and the entertaining comedies by [[Til Schweiger]] there was a vast gap in Germany, which urgently had to be filled.<ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> He made the film in a way that should have a \u201cseductive effect\u201d on the viewers to make them interested in The Wave and by doing so show the powerful attraction such a movement can have.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/><ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> He chose J\u00fcrgen Vogel as the leading actor because he wanted someone he himself would have liked to have as a teacher, for Vogel brought with him real life experience and a certain kind of authority. In Gansel's own schooldays it had been these kind of teachers whom he had trusted the most. Gansel, whose grandfather had been a Wehrmacht officer, also announced that this film would be the first and last one concerning the topic of the Third Reich in his career as a director.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/>\n\n===Formal realisation===\nTeacher Wenger's casual manner at the beginning of the film contributes to the expectation of a [[Comedy film|comedy]].<ref name=\"Steller\">Ulrich Steller: Kapitel ''Filmische Mittel'' in: ''Die Welle.

M\u00e4rz 2008</ref> or U.S. high school films that assign a particular adolescent type to every character.<ref name=\"FR_13-3-08\"/> [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] focuses less on mental [[motivation]] processes of the individual characters but rather on the resulting sense of community.<ref name=\"Focus\">Harald Pauli: ''Lass den Nazi raus!'' In: ''Focus'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 68</ref> His script co-author Thorwarth emphasized that it is necessary to define the characters very clearly in order to retain the common thread despite the variety. The film is structured by five days of the project week. At this, the beginning of every new day of the week is marked by an insert.<ref name=\"Steller\"/>\n\nThe narrative style doesn't keep the audience at distance, so that it can reflect on the things that happened, but rather lets them experience the occurrences; so the plot is narrated linearly. Similar experiences of various characters, for instance, scenes in which students tell their parents about their day at school, are realized as cross-cutting and thus demonstrate the range of different perceptions of the day. The film is narrated from the perspective of a third person, although particular scenes provide individual characters' subjective points of view. An example for this is the scene in which Karo is in the schoolhouse at night, or the scene at the end when Wenger is arrested by the police and driven away.  While on the one hand Wenger is filmed in low angle shot and sings rock music in the opening sequence, on the other hand he seems depressed in this last scene. \"Slow motion shots reflect [his] tormenting self-reproaches.\" The change to the subjective view of the thoughtful character corresponds to the dramatic composition throughout the film. This change is meant to initiate reflections on the part of the audience.<ref name=\"Steller\"/> Gansel justifies the drastic end with the necessity of shocking the audience after the length of the film, of providing a counter-statement and of taking up a stance.<ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> A critic assumed that in this country you can't say Adolf without having consequences. So triggering off fascism involves a couple of dead persons.<ref name=\"SZ_12-3-08\"/>\n\nThroughout the film high and low angle shots are used in order to express the balance of power, those at the \u201ctop\u201d and those at the \u201cbottom\u201d. At some parts, the film utilizes stylistic devices of the Nazi weekly reviews, which recorded [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]\u2019s speeches. An example for this is the closing speech of Wenger. In this scene the camera is placed close behind him, at the level of his nape, and so offers a view of the geometrically arranged crowd of students.<ref name=\"Steller\"/> Other scenes are based on pop culture. Especially the film clip in which the Wave-supporters spray their logo on buildings, is staged in the style of a [[music video]].<ref name=\"Steller\"/><ref name=\"SpO\">Christoph Cadenbach: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/kino/0,1518,538623,00.html Wie Sch\u00fcler sich freudestrahlend in Faschisten verwandeln]'' In: ''Spiegel Online'', 10.

They criticized that the psychological developments are missed out, Wenger and the other figures are partially constructed by cliches,<ref name=\"epd_3-08\"/> or defined by \u201csomething model-like\u201d,<ref name=\"StZ\"/> they also argued that the figures are \u201cslightly oversubscribed stereotypes\u201d<ref name=\"BZ\">Julia Teichmann: ''Macht, Gemeinschaft, Disziplin'' In: ''Berliner Zeitung'', 12.

The movie, according to the critics, therefore often seems \u201cvery pedagogically prescribing: you know, what is meant, but you don\u2019t really believe it.\u201d<ref name=\"Tgs_13-3-08\">Sebastian Handke: ''Die Wei\u00dfw\u00e4scher'' In: ''Der Tagesspiegel'', 13.

Because [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] attributes a position as a left-winger and former squatter to him, he involuntarily provides further evidence for the [[G\u00f6tz Aly]]\u2018s thesis, that the [[German student movement|68er Bewegung]] have further developed the authoritarian body of thought of the Nazis of 1933, they argued critically.<ref name=\"Focus\"/> But the character\u2018s composition was also defended: \u201cThe categorization is rather necessary here, because it shows the vulnerability of entirely different people for one and the same idea.\u201c<ref>Gebhard H\u00f6lzl: ''Die Welle''.

[[:de:Jan Plewka|Jan Plewka]] wrote and recorded a song for the film, ''Was Dich So Ver\u00e4ndert Hat'', in both a German and English version. The German version ended up in the film but the English version is available on an international version of the soundtrack.

The names were changed to sound German, but the characters are similar. For example, Rainer Wenger, Karo, Marco, Mona, and Tim correspond to Ben Ross, Laurie Saunders, David Collins, Andrea, and Robert Billings. The outsider theme was expanded by introducing three new characters: Sinan who is [[Turkish people|Turkish]], Kevin the aggressive bully, and Dennis from [[East Germany]] who is mocked as \"[[Ossi (East Germans)|Ossi]]\". The 1981 film's ending, where there is no violence and the teacher is not arrested, is much tamer than the ending of ''Die Welle'' and is more accurate to the real-world events that inspired both films.\n\n==Box-office success and awards==\n\nWhen the movie was released the publisher Die Brosch\u00fcre provided schools with material to help teachers \"to prepare the visit to the movie theater\u201c as well as \"reviewing it afterwards\u201c. Furthermore, an official novel corresponding to the movie, written by Kerstin Winter, was published. The Wave was released with 279<ref>''Spiegel Online'', 17.

One day later it was first screened in Austrian movie theaters. Overall the movie attracted 2.5 million German viewers.

Furthermore, Ueli Christen was nominated in the category Best Editing. In the same minute lead actor J\u00fcrgen Vogel was nominated in the category Best Actor at the European Film Awards 2008. Moreover, The Wave was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in the World Cinema - Dramatic section without receiving an award. The movie was also shortlisted for the seating contest of a German airbender for the Oscar in the category Best Foreign Language Film, but lost out to ''[[The Baader Meinhof Complex]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Wave (TV special)]]\n* [[We Are the Wave]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.welle.film.de/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1063669|The Wave}}\n* {{Amg movie|426715|The Wave}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|the_wave_2008|The Wave}}\n* [http://www.thewavehome.com The Wave Home] Website with story history, FAQ, links, etc. by original Wave students\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/16/schoolsworldwide.film/ guardian.co.uk Article]\n\n{{Dennis Gansel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wave, The}}\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:German films]]\n[[Category:German-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dennis Gansel]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films set in schools]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2014}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Wave\n| image          = Diewelle poster.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster \n| director       = [[Dennis Gansel]] \n| producer       = [[Rat Pack Filmproduktion]]<br>[[Christian Becker]]\n| screenplay     = [[Dennis Gansel]]<br />[[:de:Peter Thorwarth|Peter Thorwarth]]<br />[[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones (novel & diary)]]\n| based on       = {{based on|''[[The Wave (novel)|The Wave]]''|[[Todd Strasser]]}}\n| starring       = [[J\u00fcrgen Vogel]]<br />[[Frederick Lau]]<br />[[Max Riemelt]]<br />[[Jennifer Ulrich]]\n| music          = [[Heiko Maile]]\n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| studio         = \n| distributor    = [[Constantin Film]] \n| released       = {{Film date|df=y|2008|01|18|[[2008 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]}}\n| runtime        = 107 minutes\n| country        = Germany\n| language       = German\n| budget         = [[Euro|\u20ac]]5 million\n| gross          = \u20ac32,350,637<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&country=00&id=_fDIEWELLE01|title=Die Welle (The Wave) (2008)|website=boxofficemojo.com}}</ref>\n}}\n'''''Die Welle''''' ('''The Wave''') is a 2008 German socio-political thriller film directed by [[Dennis Gansel]] and starring [[J\u00fcrgen Vogel]], [[Frederick Lau]], [[Jennifer Ulrich]] and [[Max Riemelt]] in the leads. It is based on [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]]' [[social experiment]] [[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave]] and [[Todd Strasser]]'s novel, ''[[The Wave (novel)|The Wave]]''. The film was produced by [[Christian Becker]] for [[Rat Pack Filmproduktion]]. It was successful in German cinemas, and after ten weeks, 2.3 million people had watched it.\n\n==Plot==\nA school teacher of history, Rainer Wenger, is forced to teach a class on [[autocracy]], despite being an [[Anarchy|anarchist]]. When his students, third generation after the [[World War II|Second World War]],<ref>Jeff Dawson ''...salutes a hit German film ...'' ''[[Sunday Times]]'' 31 Aug 2008</ref> do not believe that a dictatorship could be established in modern Germany, he starts an experiment to demonstrate how easily the masses can be manipulated. He begins by demanding that all students address him as \"Herr Wenger\", as opposed to Rainer,<ref>Note: This is actually the usual way for German students to address teachers. In itself, it is not specifically authoritarian; in this case, it means that Rainer Wenger had ''before'' been a highly unusally informal teacher who changes that policy now.</ref> and places students with poor grades beside students with good grades\u2014purportedly so they can learn from one another and become better as a whole. When speaking, they must stand and give short, direct answers. Wenger shows his students the effect of marching together in the same rhythm, motivating them by suggesting that they could really annoy the anarchy class, which is below them. Wenger suggests a uniform, to remove class distinction and further unite the group. Mona argues it will remove individuality, as well. Karo shows up to class without the uniform and is ostracized. The students decide among themselves they need a name, deciding on \"Die Welle\" (The Wave). Karo suggests another name, which ends up with one single vote cast by herself.\n\nThe group is shown to grow closer and the bully Simon is shown to reform, protecting a classmate from other bullies. He also creates a distinctive salute for the group. Karo and Mona protest the actions of the group, and Mona, disgusted with how her classmates are embracing [[fascism]], leaves the project group. The other classmates don't see her departure as a connection with fascism and continue attending. The members of The Wave begin spray-painting their logo around town at night, having parties where only Wave members are allowed to attend, and ostracizing and tormenting anyone not in their group. Tim becomes very attached to the group, having finally become an accepted member of a social group. He burns his brand clothes, after a discussion about how large corporations do not take responsibility for their actions.\n\nA pair of punks start a fight with Tom, but he is saved by Bomber and Sinan and starts to bond with them. When Tim and his group of new friends are confronted by a group of angry punks (including those that Tim faced previously), Tim pulls a [[Walther PP]] pistol, causing them to back down. Tim explains to his shocked friends that the pistol only fires blanks. Tim later shows up at Wenger's house, offering to be his bodyguard. Wenger declines his offer but invites Tim in for dinner. This puts further strain on Wenger's already tense relationship with his wife, Anke, who thinks his experiment has gone too far. Wenger finally ejects Tim from his house, only to find in the morning that the boy had slept on his doorstep. Anke is upset upon learning of this, and tells Wenger to stop the experiment immediately. He accuses her of being jealous and insults her dependency on pills to be able to show up to work. Shocked, she leaves him, saying The Wave has made him a bad person.\n\nKaro continues her opposition to The Wave, earning the anger of many in the group, who ask her boyfriend, Marco, to do something about it. A water polo competition is due that day, and Wenger asks The Wave to show up in support of the team. Karo and Mona, denied entry to the competition by members of The Wave, sneak in another way to distribute anti-Wave fliers. Members of The Wave notice this and scramble to retrieve the papers before anybody reads them. In the chaos, Sinan starts a fight with an opposing team member, the two almost drowning each other. Members of The Wave in the stands begin to violently shove one another. After the match, Marco confronts Karo and accuses her of causing the fight. She replies that The Wave has brainwashed him completely, and he slaps Karo, causing her to get a nosebleed. Unsettled by his own behavior, Marco approaches Wenger and asks him to stop the project. Wenger agrees and calls a rally for The Wave members for the following day in the school's auditorium.\n\nOnce in the rally, Wenger has the doors locked and begins whipping the students into a fervor. When Marco protests, Wenger calls him a traitor and orders the students to bring him to the stage for punishment. Wenger uses this to test the students to see how extreme the Wave has become. Wenger declares he is disbanding the Wave, but Dennis argues that they should try to salvage the good parts of the movement. Wenger points out that there is no way to remove the negative elements from fascism. Tim draws a gun and refuses to accept the Wave is over, fearing that he will once more be lonely and states that the Wave is his life. When Bomber says the gun only fires blanks, Tim shoots him to prove the pistol has live rounds. Wenger tries to calm Tim, who is now aiming the gun at him. When Tim demands why he shouldn't shoot Wenger too, Wenger says that without him, there would be no one to lead The Wave. Tim abruptly shoots himself instead, preferring to commit suicide rather than go on living without The Wave. Wenger cradles his corpse and looks helplessly at his now traumatized students. The film ends with Wenger being arrested by the police and driven away, Bomber being taken away to the hospital, and Marco and Karo being re-united. The final images show Wenger in the back of a police car, staring into the camera overcome with distress.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Vogel]] as Rainer Wenger, the teacher who started the experiment with his class.\n* [[Frederick Lau]] as Tim, an [[emotional insecurity|insecure]], mentally unstable student who has had problems with his family.

The [[Stanford prison experiment]] of 1971 was adapted for the 2001 production ''[[Das Experiment]]'' by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and the 2015 production directed by [[Kyle Patrick Alvarez]], ''[[The Stanford Prison Experiment (film)|The Stanford Prison Experiment]]''. Gansel's Wave is based on teacher Ron Jones's [[The Third Wave (experiment)|\"Third Wave\" experiment]], which took place at a Californian school in 1967. Because his students did not understand how something like [[Nazism|national socialism]] could even happen, he founded a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], strictly-organized \"movement\" with harsh punishments that was led by him autocratically. The intricate sense of community led to a wave of enthusiasm not only from his own students, but also from students from other classes who joined the program later. Jones later admitted to having enjoyed having his students as followers. To eliminate the upcoming momentum, Jones aborted the project on the fifth day and showed the students the parallels towards the Nazi youth movements.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\">Christa Hanetseder: ''Lehrer gegen Vorurteile.

In: ''Hamburger Abendblatt'', 10.

In the same year, Morton Rhue published his book \"The Wave\", which was published in Germany in 1984 and has since enjoyed great success as a school literature text. It has sold a total of over 2.5 million copies.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\"/><ref name=\"Jung\" /><ref name=\"StZ\">Ina Hochreuther: ''Die Schule und die Diktatur'' In: ''Stuttgarter Zeitung'', 13.

M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 15</ref> The story has also influenced many plays and role plays worldwide.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\"/><ref name=\"Jung\"/>\n\nThe [[screenplay]] is based on an article written by Ron Jones in which he talks about the experiment and how he remembers it. The rights to the story which belonged to [[Sony]] were given over to Dennis Gansel for the production of a German movie.<ref name=\"DG_HA\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit dem ''Hamburger Abendblatt'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 3: ''\u201eAn den psychologischen Mechanismen hat sich nichts ge\u00e4ndert\u201c''</ref> As a consequence, Morton Rhue whose novel popularized the material in Germany and the publisher Ravensburg did not receive direct revenues from the film project.<ref name=\"FR_13-3-08\">Daniel Kothenschulte: ''Der freie Wille'' In: ''Frankfurter Rundschau'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 33</ref> Gansel was working on the book for one year until he asked [[:de:Peter Thorwarth|Peter Thorwarth]] to join him as a co-author. The screenplay moves the experiment, which was carried out in [[California]] in the 1960s, to present day Germany. The specific location is never mentioned explicitly as it stands for [[Germany]] as a whole. Gansel explained that he did not intend to reenact Jones\u2019 experiment, but rather show how it would be carried out in present-day Germany. He said the movie is not an adaption and that he changed characters, dialogues as well as the beginning and ending of the movie.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> This also includes subsidiary aspects such as the [[football team]] which was turned into a water polo team in the German version whose coach, as opposed to the original, is the teacher himself. The major difference, however, concerns the physical violence and the bloody end which became part of the movie. Nonetheless, Gansel claimed in an interview that it was extremely important to him to ensure that his movie would not differ as much from the experiment as Rhue's book. Thereby he described Jones, who supported the film project as a counselor, as a \"living certificate of authenticity\u201c and that the ending was inspired by the [[Emsdetten school shooting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoutsiderarg.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/dennis-gansel-riding-on-the-crest-of-the-wave/|title=Dennis Gansel riding on the crest of the wave|date=4 February 2013|publisher=}}</ref> He claimed that Jones does not like the way the characters in Rhue's novel are depicted.<ref name=\"DG_Cinema\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit ''Cinema'', Nr.&nbsp;4/2008, S. 36</ref> The former teacher commented that Gansel's movie gave an \"incredibly convincing\u201c account of the actual experiment.<ref name=\"Jung\"/>\n\nAccording to Gansel, representatives of the [[Bavaria]]n film-funding agency which were initially inquired to fund the film project declined because they compared it to Rhue's novel. Furthermore, they criticized that the teacher lacked a clear anti-authoritarian position in the submitted script. The entire project was jeopardized and the first film-funding agency to grant financial aid was the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg. Afterwards, the [[:de:Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|German Federal Film Board]] (FFA) and the [[:de:Deutscher Filmf\u00f6rderfonds|German Federal Film Fund]] (DFFF) as well as other co-producers decided to subsidize the project. [[Constantin Film]] also became one of the sponsors and further managed the film's distribution. The overall budget of the movie amounts to 4,5 million euros and the movie was shot within 38 days.\n\n==Important concepts of the movie==\n\n===Gansel\u2019s concept===\nAccording to [[Dennis Gansel]], German students have grown tired of the topic concerning the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Gansel himself had felt an oversaturation during his schooldays and had developed an emotional connection to this chapter of German history only after watching the film ''[[Schindler's List]]''.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> One difference between the experiment conducted at the time in the [[United States]] and today's [[Germany]] he saw in the fact that the American students had asked themselves quite horrified how there could even exist something like the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. His film, however, was made on the premise that people felt immune to the possibility of a repetition of history as a result of the intensive study of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and its mechanisms. \u201cTherein lies the great danger. It is an interesting fact that we always believe that what happens to others would never happen to us. We blame others, for example the less educated or the [[East Germany|East Germans]] etc. However, in the Third Reich the house caretaker was just as fascinated by the movement as was the intellectual.\u201d<ref name=\"DG_Standard\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit ''Der Standard'', 11. Februar 2008, S. 28: ''Faschismus ist f\u00fcr alle anziehend''</ref>\n\nThe small town the movie is set in is prosperous and does not show any salient social or economic problems and the teacher practices a liberal lifestyle. [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] is convinced that the plot gains a broader psychological validity by the choice of such a location.  \u201cEveryone thinks they would have been [[Anne Frank]]s and [[Sophie Scholl]]s in [[Nazi Germany]]. In my opinion this is complete nonsense. I would say that biographies of resistance rather originate in coincidences,\u201d claims Gansel. He then explains that, for example, Karo's political awareness and opposition arise out of vanity: she does not like the white shirt.<ref name=\"DG_StN\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit den ''Stuttgarter Nachrichten'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 12: ''\u201eWiderstandsbiografien entstehen aus Zuf\u00e4llen\u201c''</ref> In the past Gansel had been sure that he would have been part of the resistance but while working on The Wave he realized how \u201cnon-politically\u201d the conversion of people took place.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> He remarks that every human being has the need for belonging to a group.\n\nHe says he does not believe that films are capable of having a greater political impact on the viewers and that a film can only influence people who were already sensitized to the topic presented. In his opinion films can at best stimulate discussions, but to be able to do that they have to be really entertaining. \u201cIn Germany there has always existed the great misunderstanding that politics in the world of cinema were synonymous with boredom,\u201d says Gansel. He claims that in between high-brow cinema, as films by [[Christian Petzold (director)|Christian Petzold]], and the entertaining comedies by [[Til Schweiger]] there was a vast gap in Germany, which urgently had to be filled.<ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> He made the film in a way that should have a \u201cseductive effect\u201d on the viewers to make them interested in The Wave and by doing so show the powerful attraction such a movement can have.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/><ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> He chose J\u00fcrgen Vogel as the leading actor because he wanted someone he himself would have liked to have as a teacher, for Vogel brought with him real life experience and a certain kind of authority. In Gansel's own schooldays it had been these kind of teachers whom he had trusted the most. Gansel, whose grandfather had been a Wehrmacht officer, also announced that this film would be the first and last one concerning the topic of the Third Reich in his career as a director.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/>\n\n===Formal realisation===\nTeacher Wenger's casual manner at the beginning of the film contributes to the expectation of a [[Comedy film|comedy]].<ref name=\"Steller\">Ulrich Steller: Kapitel ''Filmische Mittel'' in: ''Die Welle.

M\u00e4rz 2008</ref> or U.S. high school films that assign a particular adolescent type to every character.<ref name=\"FR_13-3-08\"/> [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] focuses less on mental [[motivation]] processes of the individual characters but rather on the resulting sense of community.<ref name=\"Focus\">Harald Pauli: ''Lass den Nazi raus!'' In: ''Focus'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 68</ref> His script co-author Thorwarth emphasized that it is necessary to define the characters very clearly in order to retain the common thread despite the variety. The film is structured by five days of the project week. At this, the beginning of every new day of the week is marked by an insert.<ref name=\"Steller\"/>\n\nThe narrative style doesn't keep the audience at distance, so that it can reflect on the things that happened, but rather lets them experience the occurrences; so the plot is narrated linearly. Similar experiences of various characters, for instance, scenes in which students tell their parents about their day at school, are realized as cross-cutting and thus demonstrate the range of different perceptions of the day. The film is narrated from the perspective of a third person, although particular scenes provide individual characters' subjective points of view. An example for this is the scene in which Karo is in the schoolhouse at night, or the scene at the end when Wenger is arrested by the police and driven away.  While on the one hand Wenger is filmed in low angle shot and sings rock music in the opening sequence, on the other hand he seems depressed in this last scene. \"Slow motion shots reflect [his] tormenting self-reproaches.\" The change to the subjective view of the thoughtful character corresponds to the dramatic composition throughout the film. This change is meant to initiate reflections on the part of the audience.<ref name=\"Steller\"/> Gansel justifies the drastic end with the necessity of shocking the audience after the length of the film, of providing a counter-statement and of taking up a stance.<ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> A critic assumed that in this country you can't say Adolf without having consequences. So triggering off fascism involves a couple of dead persons.<ref name=\"SZ_12-3-08\"/>\n\nThroughout the film high and low angle shots are used in order to express the balance of power, those at the \u201ctop\u201d and those at the \u201cbottom\u201d. At some parts, the film utilizes stylistic devices of the Nazi weekly reviews, which recorded [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]\u2019s speeches. An example for this is the closing speech of Wenger. In this scene the camera is placed close behind him, at the level of his nape, and so offers a view of the geometrically arranged crowd of students.<ref name=\"Steller\"/> Other scenes are based on pop culture. Especially the film clip in which the Wave-supporters spray their logo on buildings, is staged in the style of a [[music video]].<ref name=\"Steller\"/><ref name=\"SpO\">Christoph Cadenbach: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/kino/0,1518,538623,00.html Wie Sch\u00fcler sich freudestrahlend in Faschisten verwandeln]'' In: ''Spiegel Online'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008</ref> This logo is designed as \"a jagged [[tsunami]] wave in a similar way to [[Manga]] comics.\"<ref name=\"SpO\"/> There is a high frequency and abrupt manner of film editing.

Solely the opinions on the actors were always the same. \u201cFrom the first scene on, the sympathetic guy tears the audience on his side\u201d,<ref name=\"SpO\"/> it was reported about [[J\u00fcrgen Vogel]], he was transforming the moral ambiguity of his figure into a \u201cmercurial energy\u201d.<ref name=\"FAZ_13-3-08\">Andreas Kilb: ''Auf Wiedersehen, Kinder'' In: ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 36</ref> He played his role realistically,<ref name=\"epd_3-08\"/> was \u201ccredible\u201d<ref name=\"StZ\"/> or the ideal cast.<ref name=\"Zeit_13-3-08\"/> For the young actors the most frequently used word was \u201cconvincing\u201d,<ref name=\"StZ\"/><ref name=\"epd_3-08\"/><ref name=\"StN\">Eva Maria Schlosser: ''Das Experiment entgleist'' In: ''Stuttgarter Nachrichten'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 20</ref> while the 18-year-old [[Frederick Lau]] in his role as the outcast Tim received special highlighting.<ref name=\"SpO\"/><ref name=\"StN\"/> In contrast to the praise for the actors, many critics demurred on the figures, developed by the screenplay. They criticized that the psychological developments are missed out, Wenger and the other figures are partially constructed by cliches,<ref name=\"epd_3-08\"/> or defined by \u201csomething model-like\u201d,<ref name=\"StZ\"/> they also argued that the figures are \u201cslightly oversubscribed stereotypes\u201d<ref name=\"BZ\">Julia Teichmann: ''Macht, Gemeinschaft, Disziplin'' In: ''Berliner Zeitung'', 12.

The movie, according to the critics, therefore often seems \u201cvery pedagogically prescribing: you know, what is meant, but you don\u2019t really believe it.\u201d<ref name=\"Tgs_13-3-08\">Sebastian Handke: ''Die Wei\u00dfw\u00e4scher'' In: ''Der Tagesspiegel'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 31</ref> The critics add, that the pretended serfdom of the Wave-supporters is also undermined by celebrating and tagging excessively.<ref name=\"StN\"/> Why the teacher, established as an authority person, becomes a victim of his own staged role play, \u201cremains puzzling\u201c, the critics claim. Because [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] attributes a position as a left-winger and former squatter to him, he involuntarily provides further evidence for the [[G\u00f6tz Aly]]\u2018s thesis, that the [[German student movement|68er Bewegung]] have further developed the authoritarian body of thought of the Nazis of 1933, they argued critically.<ref name=\"Focus\"/> But the character\u2018s composition was also defended: \u201cThe categorization is rather necessary here, because it shows the vulnerability of entirely different people for one and the same idea.\u201c<ref>Gebhard H\u00f6lzl: ''Die Welle''. In: ''Fr\u00e4nkische Nachrichten'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008.</ref>\n\nThere was also disagreement about the staging. The movie was exciting, disturbing and fascinating,<ref name=\"Cinema_4-08\"/> and deals with a difficult plot as exciting entertainment, some critics pointed out.<ref name=\"fd_6-08\">Mike Beilfu\u00df: ''Die Welle'' In: ''film-dienst'' Nr.&nbsp;6/2008, S. 53</ref> For a mainstream movie \"The Wave\u201c was often \"pleasantly rough and snotty\u201c, they reported.<ref name=\"SpO\"/> Other critics accused the movie of being conventionally staged, similar to a ''[[Tatort]]''-police procedural TV series,<ref name=\"Tgs_13-3-08\"/> or let off steam about the \"graffiti-scenes and a nearly never-ending escalating party scene.\"<ref name=\"StN\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack of the film was released on 25 May 2008 through [[EMI|EMI Germany]], and contains tracks by [[The Subways]], [[Kilians]], [[Johnossi]], [[Digitalism (band)|Digitalism]] and [[The Hives]], as well as a cover version of the classic [[Ramones]]' track \"[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]\" made for the film by the German punk band [[:de:EL*KE|EL*KE]]. [[:de:Jan Plewka|Jan Plewka]] wrote and recorded a song for the film, ''Was Dich So Ver\u00e4ndert Hat'', in both a German and English version. The German version ended up in the film but the English version is available on an international version of the soundtrack. The title-song \"Garden Of Growing Hearts\" was performed by Berlin band Empty Trash.

The names were changed to sound German, but the characters are similar. For example, Rainer Wenger, Karo, Marco, Mona, and Tim correspond to Ben Ross, Laurie Saunders, David Collins, Andrea, and Robert Billings. The outsider theme was expanded by introducing three new characters: Sinan who is [[Turkish people|Turkish]], Kevin the aggressive bully, and Dennis from [[East Germany]] who is mocked as \"[[Ossi (East Germans)|Ossi]]\". The 1981 film's ending, where there is no violence and the teacher is not arrested, is much tamer than the ending of ''Die Welle'' and is more accurate to the real-world events that inspired both films.\n\n==Box-office success and awards==\n\nWhen the movie was released the publisher Die Brosch\u00fcre provided schools with material to help teachers \"to prepare the visit to the movie theater\u201c as well as \"reviewing it afterwards\u201c. Furthermore, an official novel corresponding to the movie, written by Kerstin Winter, was published. The Wave was released with 279<ref>''Spiegel Online'', 17.

One day later it was first screened in Austrian movie theaters. Overall the movie attracted 2.5 million German viewers. [46]\n\nThe Wave received an award for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role ([[Frederick Lau]]) and the [[Deutscher Filmpreis|Bronze Lola]] in the category Best Feature Film at the German Film Awards in 2008 ([[Deutscher Filmpreis]]). Furthermore, Ueli Christen was nominated in the category Best Editing. In the same minute lead actor J\u00fcrgen Vogel was nominated in the category Best Actor at the European Film Awards 2008. Moreover, The Wave was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in the World Cinema - Dramatic section without receiving an award. The movie was also shortlisted for the seating contest of a German airbender for the Oscar in the category Best Foreign Language Film, but lost out to ''[[The Baader Meinhof Complex]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Wave (TV special)]]\n* [[We Are the Wave]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.welle.film.de/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1063669|The Wave}}\n* {{Amg movie|426715|The Wave}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|the_wave_2008|The Wave}}\n* [http://www.thewavehome.com The Wave Home] Website with story history, FAQ, links, etc. by original Wave students\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/16/schoolsworldwide.film/ guardian.co.uk Article]\n\n{{Dennis Gansel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wave, The}}\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:German films]]\n[[Category:German-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dennis Gansel]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films set in schools]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n", "name_user": "AppleRadiation", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:Corrected a typo where \"Tim\" had been written as \"Tom\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_(2008_film)"}
