Not fleeing the police on grim streets, Dre's gangstas were cruising sunny boulevards in modified 1964 [[Chevy Impala]]<nowiki/>s, showcasing them at street rallies, mingling at barbecues, and, after nightfall, drinking [[malt liquor]] at parties, at any moment puffing weed, altogether, at that time, \"a glamorous brand of gangsta rap\". Reeves adds, \"Whereas the threatening sounds Dre created for N.W.A were shunned by radio and television, the smoothed-out production on ''The Chronic'', sounding more like R&B than hip hop, made hardcore attractive to these outlets.

They all targeted Time Warner apparently since its [[Record label#Major labels|major music company]] Warner Music Group, as the only publicly traded American music company, was singularly vulnerable to public pressure. But, as foreign companies, like Germany's [[Bertelsmann Music Group]], or BMG\u2014the major label parenting, for instance, [[Arista Records]], offering distribution to [[Bad Boy Entertainment]]\u2014were delivering even more gangsta rap, Time Warner alleged itself targeted by political opportunists.

Harris notes that [[Tha Dogg Pound]] saw its October 1995 or debut album, ''[[Dogg Food]]'', \"delayed, as sharesholders of their parent record company, Interscope/Time Warner, had decided that they would protest the lyrical content of the album\". Harris claims that, \"coupled with the shareholder's protest, Suge Knight's incarceration, Snoop Dogg's exit, and Tupac Shakur's death ended the label's hold on the hip-hop scene\". As Harris concedes, \"the album did enjoy high sales\". But in Harris's estimation, \"this was the last high-selling album released on Death Row in the 1990s\". On the contrary, released months later, in February 1996, 2Pac's ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' was a juggernaut. Merely, by February 1998, Tha Dogg Pound's [[Daz Dillinger|Daz]] was the last high-selling artist still with Death Row [Strauss, ''NYT'', 1998].

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, it was incorporated after it had obtained from then, the Town of Cornwall, a franchise to operate a streetcar service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to hold a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2019|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707033751/https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|archive-date=2019-07-07|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

The private sector provides to [[Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad]] (ICE) nearly a quarter of the electricity generation capacity available and 10% of generated. However, there is still debate about how much private participation should be in the market.\n\nBy 2013, approximately 14.5% of the total generation in the country was provided by private companies and 23% of installed capacity in the National Power System, according with ICE.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sancho|first1=Manuel|title=Generaci\u00f3n el\u00e9ctrica privada representa el 15% de la total en el pa\u00eds {{!}} Crhoy.com|url=http://www.crhoy.com/archivo/generacion-electrica-privada-representa-el-15-de-la-total-en-el-pais/economia/|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=CRHoy.com {{!}} Periodico Digital {{!}} Costa Rica Noticias 24/7|publisher=CRHoy.com|language=es-ES}}</ref> The Law 7200 establishes that ICE has two ways to buy private electric generation. In Chapter I it is defined the regimen of autonomous or parallel generation, that regulates the BOO (Build, Own and Operate) contracts. Article 7 of the law states that the \u201cICE will be able to declare eligible a project for the use of a plant of limited capacity, meanwhile the power, with the exception of parallel generation, doesn\u2019t represent more than 15% of the collective power of electric plants that constitutes the National Power System\u201d.\n\nIn Chapter II it is defined the competitive regimen that regulates the BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) contracts. Article 20 allows the ICE to \u201cbuy electric energy from private companies up to an additional 15% of the limit specified in Article 7. This authorization is entitled for acquiring energy from hydro, geothermal, wind and any other non-conventional source, in bundles equal or smaller than 50,000 kW of maximum power (added by Law 7508 on May 9, 1995)\u201d. By 2014, ICE had 25 BOO contracts and 9 BOT contracts.\n\nDespite political pressure to increase the participation of private companies and opening the market for reducing the costs of electricity, ICE is opposing the idea arguing their expansion plan is already solving the demand for 20 years ahead and the costs of the generation matrix are the lowest.

The Project 19.233 was presented by the former candidate to the Presidency of the Republic and incumbent Congress Representative, [[Ott\u00f3n Sol\u00eds]] from the Citizen Action Party. In turn, the ICE would compensate land used for the projects with land outside the parks.

Vehicles consume 70% of the petroleum consumed in the nation, which is 40% of the total carbon emissions. The primary mode of public transportation is diesel-powered buses. More than 50% of Costa Rica's personal passenger cars are over 20 years old with high polluting engines, though the government is beginning to propose new hybrid and [[plug-in electric vehicle]] initiatives. Other proposed solutions include trains, gondolas, and trolleys in the metropolitan [[Costa Rican Central Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Costa Rica\u2019s renewable energy streak is still going, but what does that really mean? -|url = http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/04/22/costa-ricas-renewable-energy-streak-is-still-going-but-what-does-that-really-mean|website = The Tico Times {{!}} Costa Rica News {{!}} Travel {{!}} Real Estate|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref>\n\n===Reliability===\nThough hydroelectricity from dams is a high-density and high-power energy source, it is also highly dependent on weather conditions. Hydropower is reliant on rainfall and is therefore not the most reliable form of energy during seasons of drought. After an extreme season of drought in 2014, Costa Rica was forced to resort to diesel generators since sufficient rainfall was unavailable to power any of the hydroelectric dams.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSolar is an energy source that is highly dependent on weather conditions and has therefore been used on a much smaller scale than hydroelectric, wind and geothermal energy.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Environmental and social impact===\nOne main barrier to extensive geothermal power is the abundance of national parks and protected areas that prevent excavation near many of Costa Rican's volcanoes. For example, though Rincon de la Vieja has the potential to fuel a high density of geothermal energy, Costa Rican law currently prohibits the extraction of resources inside national parks in order to preserve the land.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hydroelectric dams have also been criticized for their effects on the surrounding ecosystems. Controversy around hydroelectric dam usage stems from both environmental impact on a surrounding region and from human displacement of land. Hydroelectric dams have been equated to interference in fish migration patterns, ecosystem disrupt, interference in water quality, and [[land degradation]] from flooding the land.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Facts, Hydropower Information- National Geographic|url = http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/hydropower-profile/|website = National Geographic|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Pirr\u00eds dam especially caused much controversy regarding the displacement of people who lived in the area, especially in relation to the [[indigenous peoples of Costa Rica]].

However, there is still debate about how much private participation should be in the market.\n\nBy 2013, approximately 14.5% of the total generation in the country was provided by private companies and 23% of installed capacity in the National Power System, according with ICE.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sancho|first1=Manuel|title=Generaci\u00f3n el\u00e9ctrica privada representa el 15% de la total en el pa\u00eds {{!}} Crhoy.com|url=http://www.crhoy.com/archivo/generacion-electrica-privada-representa-el-15-de-la-total-en-el-pais/economia/|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=CRHoy.com {{!}} Periodico Digital {{!}} Costa Rica Noticias 24/7|publisher=CRHoy.com|language=es-ES}}</ref> The Law 7200 establishes that ICE has two ways to buy private electric generation. In Chapter I it is defined the regimen of autonomous or parallel generation, that regulates the BOO (Build, Own and Operate) contracts. Article 7 of the law states that the \u201cICE will be able to declare eligible a project for the use of a plant of limited capacity, meanwhile the power, with the exception of parallel generation, doesn\u2019t represent more than 15% of the collective power of electric plants that constitutes the National Power System\u201d.\n\nIn Chapter II it is defined the competitive regimen that regulates the BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) contracts. Article 20 allows the ICE to \u201cbuy electric energy from private companies up to an additional 15% of the limit specified in Article 7. This authorization is entitled for acquiring energy from hydro, geothermal, wind and any other non-conventional source, in bundles equal or smaller than 50,000 kW of maximum power (added by Law 7508 on May 9, 1995)\u201d.

He was one of the famous \"[[The Four Musketeers (tennis)|Four Musketeers]]\" from his country who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

He only failed to win the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], as he was defeated in the final by his countryman [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] in straight sets, thus missing a career Grand Slam. His 1924 Wimbledon victory made him the first player from outside the English-speaking world to win the tournament. His first appearance was in the [[France Davis Cup team|French Davis Cup team]] of 1921. He also made the final of the [[World Covered Court Championships]] in 1922, losing to Henri Cochet, but won the doubles and mixed doubles. The other major he did well in was the [[World Hard Court Championships]] (played on clay) \u2013 he won the doubles with Henri Cochet there in 1922.\n\nBorotra was ranked as high as World No. 2 by [[A.
