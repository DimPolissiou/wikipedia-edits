protesters at 5:20 in the morning. The police detained three of the protesters, including the leader of the Odessa branch of [[Democratic Alliance (Ukraine)|Democratic Alliance]], Alexei Chorny.

Confederalism represents a main form of inter-governmentalism, this being defined as any form of interaction between states which takes place on the basis of sovereign independence or government.\n\nThe nature of the relationship among the member states constituting a confederation varies considerably. Likewise, the relationship between the member states and the general government, and the distribution of powers among them is variable. Some looser confederations are similar to [[intergovernmental organization|international organisations]]. Other confederations with stricter rules may resemble [[federal system]]s.\n\nSince the member states of a confederation retain their sovereignty, they have an implicit right of [[secession]]. Political philosopher Emmerich Vattel observed: \u2018Several sovereign and independent states may unite themselves together by a perpetual confederacy without each in particular ceasing to be a perfect state. \u2026 The deliberations in common will offer no violence to the sovereignty of each member\u2019.<ref>Vattel, Emmerich (1758) ''The Law of Nations'', cited in Wood, Gordon (1969) ''The Creation of the American Republic 1776 - 1787'', University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, p.355.</ref>\n\nUnder a confederate arrangement, in contrast with a [[federalism|federal]] one, the central authority is relatively weak.<ref>McCormick, John (2002) ''Understanding the European Union: a Concise Introduction'', Palgrave, Basingstoke, p. 6.</ref> Decisions made by the general government in a unicameral legislature, a council of the member states, require subsequent implementation by the member states to take effect. They are therefore not laws acting directly upon the individual, but instead have more the character of inter-state agreements.<ref>This was the key feature that distinguished the first American union, under the Articles of Confederation of 1781, from the second, under the US Constitution of 1789. Alexander Hamilton, in ''Federalist 15'', called the absence of directly-effective law in the Articles a 'defect' and the \u2018great and radical vice\u2019  in the initial system. Madison, James, Hamilton, Alexander and Jay, John (1987) ''The Federalist Papers'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 147.</ref> Also, decision-making in the general government usually proceeds by consensus (unanimity) and not by majority. Historically, these features, limiting the effectiveness of the union, mean that political pressure tends to build over time for the transition to a [[federalism|federal system of government]], as happened in the US, Swiss and German cases of regional integration.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Belgium===\nMany scholars have claimed that the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], a country with a complicated federal structure has adopted some characteristics of a confederation under the pressure of separatist movements, especially in [[Flanders]]. For example, C. E. Lagasse declared that Belgium was \"near the political system of a Confederation\" regarding the constitutional reform agreements between Belgian '''Regions''' and between '''Communities''',<ref>French ''Le conf\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme n'est pas loin'' Charles-Etienne Lagasse, ''Les Nouvelles institutions politiques de la Belgique et de l'Europe'', Erasme, [[Namur (city)|Namur]] 2003, p. 405 {{ISBN|2-87127-783-4}}</ref> while the director of the ''Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques'' (CRISP) [[Vincent de Coorebyter]]<ref>[http://www.crisp.be/UK/UK_index.html Belgian research center whose activities are devoted to the study of decision-making in Belgium and in Europe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203222600/http://www.crisp.be/UK/UK_index.html |date=3 February 2007 }}</ref> called Belgium \"undoubtedly a federation...[with] some aspects of a confederation\" in ''[[Le Soir]]''.<ref>French: \"La Belgique est  (...) incontestablement, une f\u00e9d\u00e9ration : il n\u2019y a aucun doute  (...)

As such, federal aspects still dominate. Also, for fiscal policy and public finances, the federal state dominates the other levels of government.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe increasingly confederal aspects of the Belgian Federal State appear to be a political reflection of the profound cultural, sociological and economic differences between the '''Flemish''' (Belgians who speak Dutch or Dutch dialects) and '''Walloons''' (Belgians who speak French or French dialects).<ref>Le petit Larousse 2013 p1247</ref> As an example, in the last several decades, over 95% of Belgians have voted for political parties that represent voters from only one community, the separatist [[New Flemish Alliance|N-VA]] being the party with the biggest voter support among the Flemish population. Parties that strongly advocate Belgian unity and appeal to voters of both communities play usually only a marginal role in nationwide general elections. The system in Belgium is known as [[Consociationalism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Stefan|title=Disputed Territories: The Transnational Dynamics of Ethnic Conflict Settlement|date=2004 |publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=30\u201331|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QYTKZ0z6QygC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Wippman|first1=David|editor1-last=Wippman|editor1-first=David|title=International Law and Ethnic Conflict|date=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=220|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=uy1CCqO6qUIC|chapter=Practical and Legal Constraints on Internal Power Sharing}}</ref>\n\nThis makes Belgium fundamentally different from federal countries like [[Switzerland]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]] and [[Australia]]. In those countries, national parties regularly receive over 90% of voter support. The only geographical areas comparable with Belgium within Europe are [[Catalonia]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (both part of [[Spain]]), [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] (both part of the [[United Kingdom]]) and parts of [[Italy]], where a massive voter turnout for regional (and often separatist) political parties has become the rule in the last decades, while nationwide parties advocating national unity draw around half, or sometimes less, of the votes.\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:Proclamation Canadian Confederation.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of [[Canadian Confederation]]]]\nIn [[Canada]], the word ''confederation'' has an additional, unrelated meaning.<ref name=\":0\">[[Eugene Forsey|Eugene A.

Therefore, on 1 July 1867, Canada became a self-governing [[dominion]] of the British Empire with a [[Federalism|federal structure]] under the leadership of Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]. The provinces involved were the [[Province of Canada]] (comprising Canada West, now [[Ontario]], formerly [[Upper Canada]]; and Canada East, now [[Quebec]], formerly [[Lower Canada]]), [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]]. Later participants were [[Manitoba]], [[British Columbia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] (the latter two created as provinces from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1905), and finally Newfoundland (now [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) in 1949. Canada is an unusually decentralized [[Federation|federal state]] and not a confederate association of sovereign states<ref name=\":0\" /> (the usual meaning of ''confederation'' in modern terms). A Canadian law, the ''[[Clarity Act]]'', and a court ruling, ''[[Reference Re Secession of Quebec]]'', set forth the conditions for negotiations to allow [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian provinces]] (though not [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories|territories]]) to leave the Canadian federal state; however, as this would require a constitutional amendment, there is no current \"constitutional\" method for withdrawal.\n\n===European Union===\nDue to its unique nature, and the political sensitivities surrounding it, there is no common or legal classification for the [[European Union]] (EU). However, it does bear some resemblance to both a confederation<ref>Kiljunen, Kimmo (2004). The European Constitution in the Making. Centre for European Policy Studies. pp. 21\u201326. {{ISBN|978-92-9079-493-6}}.</ref> (or a \"new\" type of confederation) and a federation.<ref>Burgess, Michael (2000). Federalism and European union: The building of Europe, 1950\u20132000. Routledge. p. 49. {{ISBN|0-415-22647-3}}. \"Our theoretical analysis suggests that the EC/EU is neither a federation nor a confederation in the classical sense. But it does claim that the European political and economic elites have shaped and moulded the EC/EU into a new form of an international organization, namely, a species of \"new\" confederation.\"</ref> The term [[supranational union]] has also been applied. The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a [[European Single Market|single economic market]], a [[European Union Customs Union|common customs territory]], (mainly) [[Schengen zone|open internal borders]], and a [[Euro|common currency]] among most member-states. However, unlike a federation, the EU does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs, defence, and taxation. Furthermore, most [[European Union law|EU laws]] (which have been developed by consensus between [[Council of the European Union|relevant national government Ministers]] and then scrutinised and approved or rejected by the [[European Parliament]]) must be [[transposition (law)|transposed]] into national law by national parliaments. Most collective decisions by member states are taken by [[qualified majority voting|weighted majorities and blocking minorities]] rather than unanimity. Any treaties or amendments thereto requires ratification by every member state before it can come into force.\n\nHowever, some academic observers more usually discuss the EU in the terms of it being a federation.<ref name=\"Josselin2006\">{{Cite journal |last=Josselin |first=Jean Michel |last2=Marciano |first2=Alain |year=2006 |title=The Political Economy of European Federalism |series=Series: Public Economics and Social Choice |publisher=Centre for Research in Economics and Management, University of Rennes 1, University of Caen |page=12 |id=WP 2006-07; UMR CNRS 6211 |url=http://crem.univ-rennes1.fr/wp/2006/ie-200607.pdf |quote=A complete shift from a confederation to a federation would have required to straightforwardly replace the principalship of the member states ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' the Union by that of the European citizens.

One of the most well-known is the [[Haudenosaunee]] (or Iroquois), but there were many others during different eras and locations across [[North America]]; these include the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], [[Western Confederacy]], [[Powhatan]], [[Seven Nations of Canada]], [[Pontiac's War#Origins|Pontiac's Confederacy]], [[Illinois Confederation]], [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]], [[Great Sioux Nation]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy]], [[Iron Confederacy]]<!--Article deleted:, [[United Confederation of Taino People]]--> and [[Council of Three Fires]].\n\nThe Haudenosaunee Confederacy, historically known as the Iroquois League or the League of Five\u2014later, Six\u2014Nations, is the country of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (in what is now the United States) and [[First Nations]] (in what is now Canada) that consists of six nations: the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], the [[Oneida people|Oneida]], the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], the [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. The Six Nations have a representative government known as the Grand Council which is the oldest governmental institution still maintaining its original form in North America.<ref>Jennings, p.94</ref> Each clan from the five nations sends chiefs to act as representatives and make decisions for the whole confederation. The League has been operating since its foundation in 1142 CE despite limited international recognition today. In fact, Haudenosaunee issues passports for its citizens, though travellers often face problems crossing State borders.\n\n===Serbia and Montenegro===\n[[Serbia and Montenegro]] (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) was a confederation {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} that was formed by the two remaining republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFR Yugoslavia): [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] and neighboring [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]]. The country was reconstituted as a very loose [[political union]] which was established on 4 February 2003.\n\nAs a confederation {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, Serbia and Montenegro were united only in very few realms, such as defense, foreign affairs and a very weak common president of the confederation. The two constituent republics functioned separately throughout the period of its short existence, and continued to operate under separate economic policies, as well as using separate currencies (the [[euro]] was and still is the only legal tender in Montenegro, while the [[Yugoslav dinar|dinar]] was still the legal tender in Serbia). On 21 May 2006, the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence referendum]] was held. Final official results indicated on 31 May that 55.5% of voters voted in favor of independence. The confederation of Yugoslavia effectively came to an end after Montenegro's formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006, and Serbia's formal declaration of independence on 5 June.\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[Switzerland]], officially known as the ''Swiss Confederation'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ |title=Startseite |publisher=admin.ch |date=13 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=en |title=Federal Chancellery - The Swiss Confederation \u2013 a brief guide |publisher=Bk.admin.ch |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514013106/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=en |archivedate=14 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://swissconfederationinstitute.org/|title=The Swiss Confederation Institute|website=The Swiss Confederation Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123160641/http://www.swissconfederationinstitute.org/|archive-date=2011-01-23|url-status=dead|access-date=2013-07-12}}</ref> is an example of a modern country that traditionally refers to itself as a confederation. This is due to the fact that the official (and traditional) name of Switzerland in German (the majority language of the Swiss) is ''{{lang|de|Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft}}'' (literally \"Swiss Comradeship by Oath\"), an expression which was translated into the Latin ''{{lang|la|Confoederatio Helvetica}}'' (Helvetic Confederation). It had been a confederacy since its inception in 1291 as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], originally created as an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps, and retains nowadays the name of Confederacy for reasons of historical tradition. The confederacy facilitated management of common interests (e.g. freedom from external domination, especially by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]], development of republican institutions in a Europe composed of monarchies, free trade, etc.) and ensured peace between the different cultural entities in the central alpine area.\n\nAfter the [[Sonderbund War]] of 1847, when some of the Catholic cantons of Switzerland tried to set up a separate union (''{{lang|de|Sonderbund}}'' in German) against the Protestant majority, the resulting political system established by the victorious Protestant cantons acquired all the characteristics of a [[federation]].<ref>Chevallaz, Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 1789 \u00e0 nos jours, p132ff, Publ.

Confederalism represents a main form of inter-governmentalism, this being defined as any form of interaction between states which takes place on the basis of sovereign independence or government.\n\nThe nature of the relationship among the member states constituting a confederation varies considerably. Likewise, the relationship between the member states and the general government, and the distribution of powers among them is variable. Some looser confederations are similar to [[intergovernmental organization|international organisations]]. Other confederations with stricter rules may resemble [[federal system]]s.\n\nSince the member states of a confederation retain their sovereignty, they have an implicit right of [[secession]]. Political philosopher Emmerich Vattel observed: \u2018Several sovereign and independent states may unite themselves together by a perpetual confederacy without each in particular ceasing to be a perfect state. \u2026 The deliberations in common will offer no violence to the sovereignty of each member\u2019.<ref>Vattel, Emmerich (1758) ''The Law of Nations'', cited in Wood, Gordon (1969) ''The Creation of the American Republic 1776 - 1787'', University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, p.355.</ref>\n\nUnder a confederate arrangement, in contrast with a [[federalism|federal]] one, the central authority is relatively weak.<ref>McCormick, John (2002) ''Understanding the European Union: a Concise Introduction'', Palgrave, Basingstoke, p. 6.</ref> Decisions made by the general government in a unicameral legislature, a council of the member states, require subsequent implementation by the member states to take effect. They are therefore not laws acting directly upon the individual, but instead have more the character of inter-state agreements.<ref>This was the key feature that distinguished the first American union, under the Articles of Confederation of 1781, from the second, under the US Constitution of 1789. Alexander Hamilton, in ''Federalist 15'', called the absence of directly-effective law in the Articles a 'defect' and the \u2018great and radical vice\u2019  in the initial system. Madison, James, Hamilton, Alexander and Jay, John (1987) ''The Federalist Papers'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 147.</ref> Also, decision-making in the general government usually proceeds by consensus (unanimity) and not by majority. Historically, these features, limiting the effectiveness of the union, mean that political pressure tends to build over time for the transition to a [[federalism|federal system of government]], as happened in the US, Swiss and German cases of regional integration.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Belgium===\nMany scholars have claimed that the Kingdom of [[Belgium]], a country with a complicated federal structure has adopted some characteristics of a confederation under the pressure of separatist movements, especially in [[Flanders]]. For example, C. E. Lagasse declared that Belgium was \"near the political system of a Confederation\" regarding the constitutional reform agreements between Belgian '''Regions''' and between '''Communities''',<ref>French ''Le conf\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme n'est pas loin'' Charles-Etienne Lagasse, ''Les Nouvelles institutions politiques de la Belgique et de l'Europe'', Erasme, [[Namur (city)|Namur]] 2003, p. 405 {{ISBN|2-87127-783-4}}</ref> while the director of the ''Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques'' (CRISP) [[Vincent de Coorebyter]]<ref>[http://www.crisp.be/UK/UK_index.html Belgian research center whose activities are devoted to the study of decision-making in Belgium and in Europe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203222600/http://www.crisp.be/UK/UK_index.html |date=3 February 2007 }}</ref> called Belgium \"undoubtedly a federation...[with] some aspects of a confederation\" in ''[[Le Soir]]''.<ref>French: \"La Belgique est  (...) incontestablement, une f\u00e9d\u00e9ration : il n\u2019y a aucun doute  (...)

As such, federal aspects still dominate. Also, for fiscal policy and public finances, the federal state dominates the other levels of government.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe increasingly confederal aspects of the Belgian Federal State appear to be a political reflection of the profound cultural, sociological and economic differences between '''The Flemish''' (Belgians who speak Dutch or Dutch dialects) and '''Walloons''' (Belgians who speak French or French dialects).<ref>Le petit Larousse 2013 p1247</ref> As an example, in the last several decades, over 95% of Belgians have voted for political parties that represent voters from only one community, the separatist [[New Flemish Alliance|N-VA]] being the party with the biggest voter support among the Flemish population. Parties that strongly advocate Belgian unity and appeal to voters of both communities play usually only a marginal role in nationwide general elections. The system in Belgium is known as [[Consociationalism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Stefan|title=Disputed Territories: The Transnational Dynamics of Ethnic Conflict Settlement|date=2004 |publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=30\u201331|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QYTKZ0z6QygC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Wippman|first1=David|editor1-last=Wippman|editor1-first=David|title=International Law and Ethnic Conflict|date=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=220|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=uy1CCqO6qUIC|chapter=Practical and Legal Constraints on Internal Power Sharing}}</ref>\n\nThis makes Belgium fundamentally different from federal countries like [[Switzerland]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]] and [[Australia]]. In those countries, national parties regularly receive over 90% of voter support. The only geographical areas comparable with Belgium within Europe are [[Catalonia]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (both part of [[Spain]]), [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] (both part of the [[United Kingdom]]) and parts of [[Italy]], where a massive voter turnout for regional (and often separatist) political parties has become the rule in the last decades, while nationwide parties advocating national unity draw around half, or sometimes less, of the votes.\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:Proclamation Canadian Confederation.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of [[Canadian Confederation]]]]\nIn [[Canada]], the word ''confederation'' has an additional, unrelated meaning.<ref name=\":0\">[[Eugene Forsey|Eugene A.

Therefore, on 1 July 1867, Canada became a self-governing [[dominion]] of the British Empire with a [[Federalism|federal structure]] under the leadership of Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]. The provinces involved were the [[Province of Canada]] (comprising Canada West, now [[Ontario]], formerly [[Upper Canada]]; and Canada East, now [[Quebec]], formerly [[Lower Canada]]), [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]]. Later participants were [[Manitoba]], [[British Columbia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] (the latter two created as provinces from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1905), and finally Newfoundland (now [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) in 1949. Canada is an unusually decentralized [[Federation|federal state]] and not a confederate association of sovereign states<ref name=\":0\" /> (the usual meaning of ''confederation'' in modern terms). A Canadian law, the ''[[Clarity Act]]'', and a court ruling, ''[[Reference Re Secession of Quebec]]'', set forth the conditions for negotiations to allow [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian provinces]] (though not [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories|territories]]) to leave the Canadian federal state; however, as this would require a constitutional amendment, there is no current \"constitutional\" method for withdrawal.\n\n===European Union===\nDue to its unique nature, and the political sensitivities surrounding it, there is no common or legal classification for the [[European Union]] (EU). However, it does bear some resemblance to both a confederation<ref>Kiljunen, Kimmo (2004). The European Constitution in the Making.

But it does claim that the European political and economic elites have shaped and moulded the EC/EU into a new form of an international organization, namely, a species of \"new\" confederation.\"</ref> The term [[supranational union]] has also been applied. The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a [[European Single Market|single economic market]], a [[European Union Customs Union|common customs territory]], (mainly) [[Schengen zone|open internal borders]], and a [[Euro|common currency]] among most member-states. However, unlike a federation, the EU does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs, defence, and taxation. Furthermore, most [[European Union law|EU laws]] (which have been developed by consensus between [[Council of the European Union|relevant national government Ministers]] and then scrutinised and approved or rejected by the [[European Parliament]]) must be [[transposition (law)|transposed]] into national law by national parliaments. Most collective decisions by member states are taken by [[qualified majority voting|weighted majorities and blocking minorities]] rather than unanimity. Any treaties or amendments thereto requires ratification by every member state before it can come into force.\n\nHowever, some academic observers more usually discuss the EU in the terms of it being a federation.<ref name=\"Josselin2006\">{{Cite journal |last=Josselin |first=Jean Michel |last2=Marciano |first2=Alain |year=2006 |title=The Political Economy of European Federalism |series=Series: Public Economics and Social Choice |publisher=Centre for Research in Economics and Management, University of Rennes 1, University of Caen |page=12 |id=WP 2006-07; UMR CNRS 6211 |url=http://crem.univ-rennes1.fr/wp/2006/ie-200607.pdf |quote=A complete shift from a confederation to a federation would have required to straightforwardly replace the principalship of the member states ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' the Union by that of the European citizens.

One of the most well-known is the [[Haudenosaunee]] (or Iroquois), but there were many others during different eras and locations across [[North America]]; these include the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], [[Western Confederacy]], [[Powhatan]], [[Seven Nations of Canada]], [[Pontiac's War#Origins|Pontiac's Confederacy]], [[Illinois Confederation]], [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]], [[Great Sioux Nation]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy]], [[Iron Confederacy]]<!--Article deleted:, [[United Confederation of Taino People]]--> and [[Council of Three Fires]].\n\nThe Haudenosaunee Confederacy, historically known as the Iroquois League or the League of Five\u2014later, Six\u2014Nations, is the country of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (in what is now the United States) and [[First Nations]] (in what is now Canada) that consists of six nations: the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], the [[Oneida people|Oneida]], the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], the [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. The Six Nations have a representative government known as the Grand Council which is the oldest governmental institution still maintaining its original form in North America.<ref>Jennings, p.94</ref> Each clan from the five nations sends chiefs to act as representatives and make decisions for the whole confederation. The League has been operating since its foundation in 1142 CE despite limited international recognition today. In fact, Haudenosaunee issues passports for its citizens, though travellers often face problems crossing State borders.\n\n===Serbia and Montenegro===\n[[Serbia and Montenegro]] (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) was a confederation {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} that was formed by the two remaining republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFR Yugoslavia): [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] and neighboring [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]]. The country was reconstituted as a very loose [[political union]] which was established on 4 February 2003.\n\nAs a confederation {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, Serbia and Montenegro were united only in very few realms, such as defense, foreign affairs and a very weak common president of the confederation. The two constituent republics functioned separately throughout the period of its short existence, and continued to operate under separate economic policies, as well as using separate currencies (the [[euro]] was and still is the only legal tender in Montenegro, while the [[Yugoslav dinar|dinar]] was still the legal tender in Serbia). On 21 May 2006, the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence referendum]] was held. Final official results indicated on 31 May that 55.5% of voters voted in favor of independence. The confederation of Yugoslavia effectively came to an end after Montenegro's formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006, and Serbia's formal declaration of independence on 5 June.\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[Switzerland]], officially known as the ''Swiss Confederation'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ |title=Startseite |publisher=admin.ch |date=13 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=en |title=Federal Chancellery - The Swiss Confederation \u2013 a brief guide |publisher=Bk.admin.ch |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514013106/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=en |archivedate=14 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://swissconfederationinstitute.org/|title=The Swiss Confederation Institute|website=The Swiss Confederation Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123160641/http://www.swissconfederationinstitute.org/|archive-date=2011-01-23|url-status=dead|access-date=2013-07-12}}</ref> is an example of a modern country that traditionally refers to itself as a confederation. This is due to the fact that the official (and traditional) name of Switzerland in German (the majority language of the Swiss) is ''{{lang|de|Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft}}'' (literally \"Swiss Comradeship by Oath\"), an expression which was translated into the Latin ''{{lang|la|Confoederatio Helvetica}}'' (Helvetic Confederation). It had been a confederacy since its inception in 1291 as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], originally created as an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps, and retains nowadays the name of Confederacy for reasons of historical tradition. The confederacy facilitated management of common interests (e.g. freedom from external domination, especially by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]], development of republican institutions in a Europe composed of monarchies, free trade, etc.) and ensured peace between the different cultural entities in the central alpine area.\n\nAfter the [[Sonderbund War]] of 1847, when some of the Catholic cantons of Switzerland tried to set up a separate union (''{{lang|de|Sonderbund}}'' in German) against the Protestant majority, the resulting political system established by the victorious Protestant cantons acquired all the characteristics of a [[federation]].<ref>Chevallaz, Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 1789 \u00e0 nos jours, p132ff, Publ.

He has a son, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]], with ex-girlfriend [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Shannon Keene|Shannon Keene]], but he abandoned them both the day Robby was born after Johnny's mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Laura|Laura]] died the same day. Johnny, self-admittedly, has never recovered from the breakup with his high school girlfriend, [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]].\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor [[Miguel Diaz (character)|Miguel Diaz]] from a gang of bullies using [[karate]]. Miguel, an [[asthmatic]] raised by his [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]] single mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen]], asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate [[dojo]] in a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with [[Daniel LaRusso]]. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership, is married to [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda]] and has two children: [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha]] and [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Anthony LaRusso|Anthony]]. Finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda, but after his friend and mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] passed away, his struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille]], his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]] and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by [[John Kreese]]. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries very hard to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] who is Sam's rival. \n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n\n===Main===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Xolo Maridue\u00f1a]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Miguel Diaz|Miguel Diaz]]\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda LaRusso]]\n* [[Tanner Buchanan]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]]\n* [[Mary Mouser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha LaRusso]]\n* [[Jacob Bertrand]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Eli Moskowitz/Hawk|Eli Moskowitz/Hawk]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* Gianni Decenzo as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Demetri|Demetri]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] (guest season 1, main season 2)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Nichole Brown as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Aisha_Robinson|Aisha Robinson]]\n* Vanessa Rubio as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Carmen_Diaz|Carmen Diaz]]\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Tory|Tory]] (season 2)\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Raymond/Stingray|Raymond AKA \"Stingray]]\" (season 2)\n* [[Aedin Mincks]] as Mitch (season 2)\n* Khalil Everage as Chris (season 2)\n* Rose Bianco as Rosa Diaz\n* Hannah Kepple as Moon\n* Griffin Santopietro as Anthony LaRusso\n* [[Bret Ernst]] as Louie LaRusso Jr. (season 1)\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Shannon Keene\n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[Ed Asner]] as  [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Sid Weinberg|Sid Weinberg]] (season 1)\n* [[Dan Ahdoot]] as Anoush Norouzi\n* Owen Morgan as Bert\n* Nathaniel Oh as Nathaniel (season 2)\n* Joe Seo as Kyler (season 1)\n* Annalisa Cochrane as Yasmine (season 1)\n* Bo Mitchell as Brucks (season 1)\n* Jonathan Mercedes as A.

Released from police custody, Johnny is visited by his wealthy stepfather Sid Weinberg, who gives Johnny a check before officially disowning him. Getting drunk, Johnny drives to the All Valley Sports Arena and relives his last encounter with his former sensei John Kreese, before his car is wrecked in a hit-and-run. Despite Johnny\u2019s protests, his car is towed to one of Daniel's dealerships for repairs. The next day, he goes to the dealership in an attempt to take the car back, only to run into Daniel. Johnny reluctantly accepts a free car repair from Daniel, who considers Johnny an old friend. While at the dealership, Johnny realizes that Daniel's daughter Samantha was one of the passengers in the hit-and-run. After Daniel says they're all better off without Cobra Kai, Johnny returns home and tells Miguel that he will be his sensei, and opens his own Cobra Kai dojo with the money from Sid.\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Strike First\n |DirectedBy      = Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg\n |WrittenBy       = Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Miguel begins his karate training with Johnny, who bullys him for his [[asthma]] and low self-esteem.

Reconciling with Samantha, Daniel learns she is romantically interested in a boy named Kyler and offers to invite him to a family dinner. At school, Miguel befriends social outcasts Dimitri and Eli. During lunch, they talk about the rich girls Samantha hangs out with and discover that Kyler is one of the bullies who attacked Miguel. Johnny is informed that his son, Robby Keene, has been caught with drugs at school. During dinner, Daniel notices Kyler's bruises and learns he received his injuries from Johnny.

Daniel embarrasses Samantha during the dance by finding her and Kyler alone in a suggestive scene. Later, Miguel overhears Kyler and his friends sexually objectifying Samantha. Remembering Johnny's teachings, Miguel attacks Kyler, but is overpowered and severely beaten by the bullies.

When Johnny tells him not to throw his life away, Robby rejects him and points out that Johnny left him as a child and that Johnny's own life is wasted. After seeing a father happily sharing a milkshake with his young son, Johnny pleads for Carmen to let him continue Miguel's training, vowing not to fail him again.

When Kyler embarrasses Samantha, Miguel stands up for her and attacks him and his friends, defeating them all in an impressive display and gaining Samantha's respect. Robby decides to reconcile with his father, but sees Johnny acting in a fatherly way with Miguel and feels he has been replaced. Amanda notices the changes in Daniel's behavior since the reopening of Cobra Kai, leading Daniel to visit the grave of Mr. Miyagi to reflect and ask for wisdom. As Daniel prepares to drive away, he suddenly recalls the discussion with Miyagi after he gifted Daniel his yellow [[1941 Ford#1948|1948 Ford Super De Luxe convertible]] on his seventeenth birthday, that the lessons on maintaining balance didn't just apply to karate, but to one's entire life.<br />''Note'': This episode is dedicated in memory of [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]].\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Quiver\n |DirectedBy      = Josh Heald\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay |s=Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg |ex1=Joe Piarulli & Luan Thomas |ex1label=Story and teleplay by}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Daniel tries unsuccessfully to persuade Samantha to take up karate again.

Thanks to Miguel, Johnny is forced to remember his childhood as an outcast with an uncaring stepfather before he discovered Cobra Kai. Johnny admits that he has been tough and cruel to his remaining students, but refuses to apologize, telling them that life is not fair and they must overcome the challenges that life will throw at them. Eli returns to the dojo with a distinctive mohawk haircut, for which Johnny nicknames him \"Hawk\".

At a meeting of the athletic committee, Johnny tries to persuade them to reverse the ban, but is opposed by Daniel, a committee member. Johnny tells the committee that his teachings are different from those of Kreese and Silver, revealing that Kreese himself is dead. He says that he has learned from his past mistakes and that his dojo is now a place where people who get bullied are taught self confidence and how to stand up for themselves.

Daniel's family learns that Cobra Kai will compete, and only Samantha thinks Cobra Kai has changed; Daniel's cousin Louie decides to take action against Johnny. Johnny warns Miguel about Samantha and the LaRusso family, telling him a biased narration of how Daniel involved himself with Johnny\u2019s ex-girlfriend Ali Mills in 1984. While skateboarding to Daniel's house, Robby meets Samantha. Carmen invites Johnny to dinner, where he learns more about Miguel's family and is inspired to clean up his life, severing ties with Sid after paying off the money he borrowed and attempting to make amends with Robby.

He has a son, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]], with ex-girlfriend [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Shannon Keene|Shannon Keene]], but he abandoned them both the day Robby was born after Johnny's mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Laura|Laura]] died the same day. Johnny, self-admittedly, has never recovered from the breakup with his high school girlfriend, [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]].\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor [[Miguel Diaz (character)|Miguel Diaz]] from a gang of bullies using [[karate]]. Miguel, an [[asthmatic]] raised by his [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]] single mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen]], asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate [[dojo]] in a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with [[Daniel LaRusso]]. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership, is married to [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda]] and has two children: [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha]] and [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Anthony LaRusso|Anthony]]. Finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda, but after his friend and mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] passed away, his struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille]], his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]] and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by [[John Kreese]]. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries very hard to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] who is Sam's rival. \n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n\n===Main===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Xolo Maridue\u00f1a]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Miguel Diaz|Miguel Diaz]]\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda LaRusso]]\n* [[Tanner Buchanan]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]]\n* [[Mary Mouser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha LaRusso]]\n* [[Jacob Bertrand]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Eli Moskowitz/Hawk|Eli Moskowitz/Hawk]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* Gianni Decenzo as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Demetri|Demetri]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] (guest season 1, main season 2)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Nichole Brown as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Aisha_Robinson|Aisha Robinson]]\n* Vanessa Rubio as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Carmen_Diaz|Carmen Diaz]]\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Tory|Tory]] (season 2)\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Raymond/Stingray|Raymond AKA \"Stingray]]\" (season 2)\n* [[Aedin Mincks]] as Mitch (season 2)\n* Khalil Everage as Chris (season 2)\n* Rose Bianco as Rosa Diaz\n* Hannah Kepple as Moon\n* Griffin Santopietro as Anthony LaRusso\n* [[Bret Ernst]] as Louie LaRusso Jr. (season 1)\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Shannon Keene\n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[Ed Asner]] as  [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Sid Weinberg|Sid Weinberg]] (season 1)\n* [[Dan Ahdoot]] as Anoush Norouzi\n* Owen Morgan as Bert\n* Nathaniel Oh as Nathaniel (season 2)\n* Joe Seo as Kyler (season 1)\n* Annalisa Cochrane as Yasmine (season 1)\n* Bo Mitchell as Brucks (season 1)\n* Jonathan Mercedes as A.

Released from police custody, Johnny is visited by his wealthy stepfather Sid Weinberg, who gives Johnny a check before officially disowning him. Getting drunk, Johnny drives to the All Valley Sports Arena and relives his last encounter with his former sensei John Kreese, before his car is wrecked in a hit-and-run. Despite Johnny\u2019s protests, his car is towed to one of Daniel's dealerships for repairs. The next day, he goes to the dealership in an attempt to take the car back, only to run into Daniel. Johnny reluctantly accepts a free car repair from Daniel, who considers Johnny an old friend. While at the dealership, Johnny realizes that Daniel's daughter Samantha was one of the passengers in the hit-and-run. After Daniel says they're all better off without Cobra Kai, Johnny returns home and tells Miguel that he will be his sensei, and opens his own Cobra Kai dojo with the money from Sid.\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Strike First\n |DirectedBy      = Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg\n |WrittenBy       = Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Miguel begins his karate training with Johnny, who bullys him for his [[asthma]] and low self-esteem.

Meanwhile, Daniel and his wife Amanda argue after Daniel scolds Samantha for inviting her friends over for a pool party without her parents' permission. Reconciling with Samantha, Daniel learns she is romantically interested in a boy named Kyler and offers to invite him to a family dinner. At school, Miguel befriends social outcasts Dimitri and Eli. During lunch, they talk about the rich girls Samantha hangs out with and discover that Kyler is one of the bullies who attacked Miguel. Johnny is informed that his son, Robby Keene, has been caught with drugs at school. During dinner, Daniel notices Kyler's bruises and learns he received his injuries from Johnny.

Daniel embarrasses Samantha during the dance by finding her and Kyler alone in a suggestive scene. Later, Miguel overhears Kyler and his friends sexually objectifying Samantha. Remembering Johnny's teachings, Miguel attacks Kyler, but is overpowered and severely beaten by the bullies.

When Johnny tells him not to throw his life away, Robby rejects him and points out that Johnny left him as a child and that Johnny's own life is wasted. After seeing a father happily sharing a milkshake with his young son, Johnny pleads for Carmen to let him continue Miguel's training, vowing not to fail him again.

When Kyler embarrasses Samantha, Miguel stands up for her and attacks him and his friends, defeating them all in an impressive display and gaining Samantha's respect. Robby decides to reconcile with his father, but sees Johnny acting in a fatherly way with Miguel and feels he has been replaced. Amanda notices the changes in Daniel's behavior since the reopening of Cobra Kai, leading Daniel to visit the grave of Mr. Miyagi to reflect and ask for wisdom. As Daniel prepares to drive away, he suddenly recalls the discussion with Miyagi after he gifted Daniel his yellow [[1941 Ford#1948|1948 Ford Super De Luxe convertible]] on his seventeenth birthday, that the lessons on maintaining balance didn't just apply to karate, but to one's entire life.<br />''Note'': This episode is dedicated in memory of [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]].\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Quiver\n |DirectedBy      = Josh Heald\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay |s=Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg |ex1=Joe Piarulli & Luan Thomas |ex1label=Story and teleplay by}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Daniel tries unsuccessfully to persuade Samantha to take up karate again.

Johnny admits that he has been tough and cruel to his remaining students, but refuses to apologize, telling them that life is not fair and they must overcome the challenges that life will throw at them. Eli returns to the dojo with a distinctive mohawk haircut, for which Johnny nicknames him \"Hawk\". Robby gets a job at LaRusso Auto to get back at his father, and Miguel and Samantha slowly become friends at school.

At a meeting of the athletic committee, Johnny tries to persuade them to reverse the ban, but is opposed by Daniel, a committee member. Johnny tells the committee that his teachings are different from those of Kreese and Silver, revealing that Kreese himself is dead. He says that he has learned from his past mistakes and that his dojo is now a place where people who get bullied are taught self confidence and how to stand up for themselves.

Miguel finds a picture of Robby in Johnny's refrigerator, and realizes that Robby is Johnny's son. Miguel tells Hawk, and when they confront Johnny, he admits the truth, but refuses to elaborate more on the matter. Johnny later takes Miguel to eat hamburgers and fries, and confides in him that on the day Robby was born, he wasn't there for him because his mother (at the time the only person Johnny cared about) had passed away.

Kreese is making Cobra Kai be more ruthless, telling Tory to finish one dojomate. Miguel calls Kreese out on it, and Kreese says that mercy may be beneficial during a tournament, but in real life they must finish the fight in order to win. While talking to Tory, Tory reveals that her mother had to work as a waitress to support Tory and her brother, and her mom would take leftovers to feed them. Her mom's boss found out, and fired Tory's mom, which caused Tory to decide that since the world shows no mercy, she shouldn't either.

At the end of the day, Miguel goes to the LaRusso\u2019s house and gives Robby the Medal of Honor, asking him to give it to Daniel, and also to tell Sam that he's sorry before leaving.

An all-out karate war between Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do erupts. The fight ends in disaster, with Miguel on lifesupport and Sam in the hospital from her injuries. Robby flees after his fighting leads to Miguel's fall. Miguel's accident results in Johnny losing Carmen and control of Cobra Kai after his remaining students turn on him and join Kreese, who tells Johnny that the landlord allowed him take over and have full ownership of the dojo when Johnny was in San Bernardino. The aftermath of the fight also provokes Amanda to demand Daniel to stop Miyagi-Do and karate.  A guilt-ridden Johnny goes to the beach, where he throws his new cell phone into the sand.

The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\n\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood.

The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985.

Another game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (1987 video game)|Top Gun]]'', was released in 1987 for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, ''Top Gun: The Second Mission'', was released for the NES three years later.\n\nAnother game, ''[[Top Gun: Fire at Will]]'', was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the [[PlayStation|Sony PlayStation]] platform. ''[[Top Gun: Hornet's Nest]]'' was released in 1998. ''[[Top Gun: Combat Zones]]'' was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001 and was subsequently released for the [[GameCube]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Combat Zones'' features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled ''Top Gun'' was released for the [[Nintendo DS]]. A 2010 game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (2010 video game)|Top Gun]]'', retells the film's story.

The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\n\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood.

During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light.

The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985.

It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1,000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]]. This was the first Mac to not have the iconic rainbow-colored apple since its creation 20 years prior.<ref name=Biricik>{{cite web|last1=Biricik|first1=Asli|title=The role of logo design in creating brand emotion: A semiotic comparison of the Apple and IBM logos|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.427.5285&rep=rep1&type=pdf|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The new look was the future or new era of Apple Inc.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant.

It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]].

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies.

A miniature [[shrine]] with magic powers is taken from its resting place on [[Okinawa]], and it is up to Miyagi and Daniel to recover it. Together with Okinawan girl Taki Tamurai (voiced by [[Janice Kawaye]]), the karatekas search the globe and, naturally, encounter several opportunities to fight their way out of trouble.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/246/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=246}}</ref>\n===Episode formula===\nThe episodes typically follow a similar formula: Mr. Miyagi obtains a lead on the shrine's location in some exotic corner of the world. Daniel and Taki follow up on it, and in the process encounter some villains who have either obtained or are seeking to obtain the shrine for their own evil purposes. After engaging and defeating the villains, Daniel comes within a hair's breadth of retrieving the shrine, only to have it escape from his grasp by random chance (for example, drifting away after being tied to a bunch of balloons, or being swept into the ocean), thus ensuring that the search continues into the next episode.\n\n==Syndication==\nThe show was available for purchase on [[iTunes]], and could be streamed for free in the US on [[Netflix]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Hulu]], and [[The Minisode Network]] and [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]].

It starred [[Joey Dedio]], [[Robert Ito]], and [[Janice Kawaye]]. It is based on the ''[[The Karate Kid (franchise)|Karate Kid]]'' series of films, and was produced by [[DIC Entertainment|DIC Animation City]], [[Saban Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Pictures Television]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=333}}</ref>\n\nThe show was originally planned for daily syndication for fall 1988 with 65 episodes, before eventually settling on a 13-episode order for NBC Saturday mornings in 1989.<ref name=\"Broadcasting Magazine; August 10, 1987 issue; Pages 2 and 3\">{{cite web|url=http://s23.postimg.org/uphxymdbe/download.jpg|publisher=americanradiohistory.com|accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe show retains apprentice Daniel LaRusso (voiced by [[Joey Dedio]]) and his mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] (voiced by [[Robert Ito]]) but abandons the karate tournament motif for an adventure/quest setting. A miniature [[shrine]] with magic powers is taken from its resting place on [[Okinawa]], and it is up to Miyagi and Daniel to recover it. Together with Okinawan girl Taki Tamurai (voiced by [[Janice Kawaye]]), the karatekas search the globe and, naturally, encounter several opportunities to fight their way out of trouble.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/246/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=246}}</ref>\n===Episode formula===\nThe episodes typically follow a similar formula: Mr. Miyagi obtains a lead on the shrine's location in some exotic corner of the world. Daniel and Taki follow up on it, and in the process encounter some villains who have either obtained or are seeking to obtain the shrine for their own evil purposes. After engaging and defeating the villains, Daniel comes within a hair's breadth of retrieving the shrine, only to have it escape from his grasp by random chance (for example, drifting away after being tied to a bunch of balloons, or being swept into the ocean), thus ensuring that the search continues into the next episode.\n\n==Syndication==\nThe show was available for purchase on [[iTunes]], and could be streamed for free in the US on [[Netflix]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Hulu]], and [[The Minisode Network]] and [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]]. As of May 2018, the show was no longer available on iTunes, Netflix, or Hulu.\n\nIn Canada, the series can be streamed online via CTV's free, ad-supported video on demand hub \"CTV Throwback\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\" style=background:#FFFFFF;\"\\\n|-\n! style=background:#252cb3|<span style=\"color: white;\">No.</span>\n! style=background:#252cb3|<span style=\"color: white;\">Title</span>\n! style=background:#252cb3|<span style=\"color: white;\">Original air date</span>\n{{Episode list\n| Title=My Brother's Keeper\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1989|9|9}}\n| EpisodeNumber=01\n| ShortSummary=In South America, a diffident teenager from a Shuar tribe finds the shrine and believes it can give him the confidence and strength to pass his tests of manhood.

A ''fabric'' is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.).

In the household they are used in [[carpet]]ing, upholstered [[furniture|furnishings]], [[window shade]]s, [[towel]]s, coverings for tables, beds, and other flat surfaces, and in [[art]]. In the workplace they are used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses include [[flag]]s, [[backpack]]s, [[tent]]s, [[Net (device)|nets]], [[handkerchief]]s, cleaning [[wikt:rag|rags]], [[transportation]] devices such as [[balloon]]s, [[kite flying|kites]], [[sail]]s, and [[parachute]]s; textiles are also used to provide strengthening in [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] and industrial [[geotextile]]s. Textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as [[sewing]], [[quilting]]  and [[embroidery]].\n\nTextiles for industrial purposes, and chosen for characteristics other than their appearance, are commonly referred to as ''[[technical textiles]].'' Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g. implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for [[crop protection]]), protective clothing (e.g. against heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing, against molten metals for welders, stab protection, and [[bullet]] proof vests). In all these applications stringent performance requirements must be met. Woven of threads coated with [[zinc oxide]] [[nanowire]]s, laboratory fabric has been shown capable of \"self-powering nanosystems\" using vibrations created by everyday actions like wind or body movements.<ref>{{cite news|author=Keim, Brandon |title=Piezoelectric Nanowires Turn Fabric Into Power Source |url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/piezoelectric-n.html |date=February 13, 2008 |work=Wired News |publisher=Cond\u00e9Net |accessdate=2008-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215001128/http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/piezoelectric-n.html |archivedate=February 15, 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Yong Qin, Xudong Wang & Zhong Lin Wang|title=Letter/abstract: Microfibre\u2013nanowire hybrid structure for energy scavenging|journal=Nature|volume=451|pages=809\u2013813|doi=10.1038/nature06601|date=October 10, 2007|pmid=18273015|issue=7180|df=}} cited in {{cite web|title=Editor's summary: Nanomaterial: power dresser|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/edsumm/e080214-06.html|work=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185507/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/edsumm/e080214-06.html|archivedate=February 15, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Sources and types ==\nTextiles are made from many materials, with four main sources: animal ([[wool]], [[silk]]), plant ([[cotton]], [[flax]], [[jute]], [[bamboo textile|bamboo]]), mineral ([[asbestos]], [[glass (fiber)|glass fibre]]), and synthetic ([[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]], [[rayon]]). The first three are natural. In the 20th century, they were supplemented by artificial fibres made from [[petroleum]]. Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest [[microfibre]] made of strands thinner than one [[Units_of_textile_measurement#Denier|denier]] to the sturdiest [[canvas]]. [[Textile manufacturing terminology]] has a wealth of descriptive terms, from light [[gauze]]-like [[Gossamer (fabric)|gossamer]] to heavy [[grosgrain]] cloth and beyond.\n\n=== Animal ===\nAnimal textiles are commonly made from [[hair]], [[fur]], [[skin]] or [[silk]] (in the silkworms case).\n\n[[Wool]] refers to the hair of the domestic [[sheep]] or [[goat]], which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a [[wax]] mixture known as [[lanolin]] (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Woollen]] refers to a bulkier yarn produced from carded, non-parallel fibre, while [[worsted]] refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibers which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. [[Cashmere wool|Cashmere]], the hair of the Indian [[cashmere goat]], and [[mohair]], the hair of the North African [[angora goat]], are types of wool known for their softness.\n\nOther animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, [[Vicu\u00f1a|vicu\u00f1a wool]], llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[poncho]]s, [[blanket]]s, and other warm coverings. [[Angora wool|Angora]] refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the [[angora rabbit]]. [[Qiviut]] is the fine inner wool of the [[muskox]].\n\n[[Wadmal]] is a coarse cloth made of wool, produced in Scandinavia, mostly 1000~1500 CE.\n\n[[Sea silk]] is an extremely fine, rare, and valuable fabric that is made from the silky filaments or byssus secreted by a gland in the foot of pen shells.\n\nSilk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of the Chinese [[silkworm]] which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness.  There are two main types of the silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the [[Bombyx mori|Bombyx Mori]], and 'wild silk' such as [[Wild silk|Tussah silk]] (wild silk). Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trevisan |first=Adrian |title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture |url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture |publisher=Sense of Nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507085636/http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Plant ===\n[[File:Barong Up Close.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a [[Barong Tagalog]] made with [[pi\u00f1a]] fiber in the [[Philippines]].]]\n[[Poaceae|Grass]], [[Juncaceae|rush]], [[hemp]], and [[sisal]] are all used in making [[rope]]. In the first two, the entire plant is used for this purpose, while in the last two, only fibres from the plant are utilized. [[Coir]] ([[coconut]] fibre) is used in making [[twine]], and also in floormats, [[Mat|doormats]], [[brush]]es, [[mattress]]es, floor tiles, and [[Bag|sacking]].\n\n[[Straw]] and [[bamboo textiles|bamboo]] are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]].\n\nFibres from [[pulpwood]] trees, cotton, [[rice paper|rice]], hemp, and [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] are used in making [[paper]].\n\n[[Cotton]], [[Linen|flax]], jute, hemp, [[Modal (textile)|modal]] and even bamboo fibre are all used in clothing. [[Pi\u00f1a]] ([[pineapple]] fibre) and [[ramie]] are also fibres used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibres such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk fibre has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibres like hemp or flax.\n\nThe inner bark of the [[Lagetta lagetto|lacebark tree]] is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope.\n\n[[cellulose acetate|Acetate]] is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as [[silk]]s, [[velvet]]s, and [[taffeta]]s.\n\n[[Seaweed]] is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fibre known as [[Alginic acid|alginate]] is produced and is used as a holding fibre; when the cloth is finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area.\n\n[[Rayon]] is a manufactured fabric derived from plant pulp. Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.\n\nFibres from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also known as 'bast' fibres.\n\n=== Mineral ===\nAsbestos and [[basalt fibre]] are used for vinyl tiles, sheeting and adhesives, \"transite\" panels and siding, acoustical ceilings, stage curtains, and fire blankets.\n\n[[Glass fibre]] is used in the production of ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fibre for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibres. Glass fibres are woven and coated with [[Teflon]] to produce [[beta cloth]], a virtually fireproof fabric which replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States [[space suit]]s since 1968.{{Verify source|date=January 2018}}\n\nMetal fibre, metal foil, and metal wire have a variety of uses, including the production of [[cloth-of-gold]] and [[jewellery]]. [[Hardware cloth]] (US term only) is a coarse woven [[mesh]] of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard [[window screen]]ing, but heavier and with a more open weave.\n\nMinerals and natural and synthetic fabrics may be combined, as in [[emery cloth]], a layer of [[Emery (rock)|emery]] abrasive glued to a cloth backing.  Also, \"sand cloth\" is a U.S. term for fine wire mesh with abrasive glued to it, employed like emery cloth or coarse [[sandpaper]].\n\n=== Synthetic ===\n[[File:Cloth 800.jpg|thumb|A variety of contemporary fabrics.

Thicker nylon fibres are used in [[rope]] and outdoor clothing.\n\n[[Spandex]] (trade name ''Lycra'') is a [[polyurethane]] product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement.  It is used to make [[activewear]], [[Brassiere|bras]], and [[swimsuit]]s.\n\n[[Olefin fibre]] is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing.  Olefins are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly.  A sintered felt of olefin fibres is sold under the trade name [[Tyvek]].\n\n[[Ingeo]] is a [[polylactide]] fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing.  It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to wick away perspiration.\n\n[[Lurex (yarn)|Lurex]] is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.\n\n[[Milk]] proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or [[casein]] fibre cloth was developed during [[World War I]] in Germany, and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s.<ref>Euroflax Industries Ltd.

This is done on a frame or machine known as a [[loom]], of which there are a number of types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanized.\n\n[[Knitting]], [[Nalebinding|looping]], and [[crochet]]ing involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed either on a [[knitting needle]], needle, or on a [[crochet hook]], together in a line. The processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while Looping and crocheting never have more than one active loop on the needle. Knitting can be performed by machine, but crochet can only be performed by hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looping and Knitting|last=Rowe|first=Ann Pollard|publisher=The Textile Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n[[Spread Tow]] is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes, and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for composite materials; [[spread tow fabric]]s can be made in [[carbon]], [[aramide]], etc.\n\n[[Braid]]ing or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making [[tatting]] and [[macrame]].\n\n[[Lace]] is made by interlocking threads together independently, using a backing and any of the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.\n\n[[Carpet]]s, rugs, velvet, [[velour]], and [[velveteen]] are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a [[nap (textile)|nap]] or [[pile (textile)|pile]].\n\nFelting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together until they become tangled.  A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.\n\n[[Nonwoven]] textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric. Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.\n\n[[Barkcloth|Bark cloth]] is made by pounding bark until it is soft and flat.\n\n== Treatments ==\n[[File:Double ikat weaving from Sulu, Philippines, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|right|A double [[ikat]] weaving made by the [[Tausug people]] from [[Sulu]], made of banana leaf stalk fiber ([[Abac\u00e1]]).]]\nTextiles are often [[dyeing|dyed]], with fabrics available in almost every colour.

However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. A ''textile'' is any material made of interlacing fibres, including [[carpet]]ing and [[geotextile]]s. A ''fabric'' is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.). ''Cloth'' may be used synonymously with ''fabric'' but is often a  piece of fabric that has been processed.\n[[File:Otavalo Artisan Market - Andes Mountains - South America - photograph 001.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alpaca]] textiles at the [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]] Artisan Market in the Andes Mountains, Ecuador]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'textile' is from [[Latin]], from the adjective ''textilis'', meaning 'woven',  from ''textus'', the past participle of the verb ''texere'',  'to weave'.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/textile|title=Textile|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe word 'fabric' also derives from Latin, most recently from the Middle [[French language|French]] ''fabrique'', or 'building, thing made', and earlier as the Latin ''fabrica'' 'workshop; an art, trade; a skilful production, structure, fabric', which is from the Latin ''faber'', or 'artisan who works in hard materials', from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''dhabh-'', meaning 'to fit together'.<ref>{{OEtymD|fabric|accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref>\n\nThe word 'cloth' derives from the [[Old English]] ''cla\u00f0'', meaning a ''cloth, woven or felted material to wrap around one'', from Proto-Germanic ''kalithaz'' (compare O.Frisian 'klath', Middle [[Dutch language|Dutch]] 'cleet', Dutch 'kleed', Middle High German 'kleit', and German 'kleid', all meaning \"garment\").<ref>{{OEtymD|cloth|accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of clothing and textiles}}\n[[File:Banton Burial Cloth.JPG|thumb|The Banton Cloth, the oldest existing example of warp [[ikat]] in Southeast Asia, displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].

At some point, people learned to weave plant fibers into textiles.\nThe discovery of dyed flax fibres in a cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] dated to 34,000 [[BCE]] suggests textile-like materials were made even in prehistoric times.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.325_1329a|pmid=19745126|title=Clothes Make the (Hu) Man|year=2009|last1=Balter|first1=M.|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5946|pages=1329}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1175404|pmid= 19745144|title=30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers|year=2009|last1=Kvavadze|first1=E.|last2=Bar-Yosef|first2=O.|last3=Belfer-Cohen|first3=A.|last4=Boaretto|first4=E.|last5=Jakeli|first5=N.|last6=Matskevich|first6=Z.|last7=Meshveliani|first7=T.|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5946|pages=1359|url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521|bibcode= 2009Sci...325.1359K}} [http://worldtextile.aimoo.com/ Supporting Online Material] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127065045/http://worldtextile.aimoo.com/ |date=2009-11-27 }}</ref>\n[[File:Textile machinery at Cambrian Factory, Llanwrtyd (1293828).jpg|thumb|Textile machinery at the Cambrian Factory, [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Wales]] in the 1940s]]\n\nThe production of textiles is a craft whose speed and scale of production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing techniques.\n\n== Uses ==\nTextiles have an assortment of uses, the most common of which are for [[clothing]] and for containers such as bags and [[basket]]s. In the household they are used in [[carpet]]ing, upholstered [[furniture|furnishings]], [[window shade]]s, [[towel]]s, coverings for tables, beds, and other flat surfaces, and in [[art]]. In the workplace they are used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses include [[flag]]s, [[backpack]]s, [[tent]]s, [[Net (device)|nets]], [[handkerchief]]s, cleaning [[wikt:rag|rags]], [[transportation]] devices such as [[balloon]]s, [[kite flying|kites]], [[sail]]s, and [[parachute]]s; textiles are also used to provide strengthening in [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] and industrial [[geotextile]]s. Textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as [[sewing]], [[quilting]]  and [[embroidery]].\n\nTextiles for industrial purposes, and chosen for characteristics other than their appearance, are commonly referred to as ''[[technical textiles]].'' Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g. implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for [[crop protection]]), protective clothing (e.g. against heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing, against molten metals for welders, stab protection, and [[bullet]] proof vests). In all these applications stringent performance requirements must be met. Woven of threads coated with [[zinc oxide]] [[nanowire]]s, laboratory fabric has been shown capable of \"self-powering nanosystems\" using vibrations created by everyday actions like wind or body movements.<ref>{{cite news|author=Keim, Brandon |title=Piezoelectric Nanowires Turn Fabric Into Power Source |url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/piezoelectric-n.html |date=February 13, 2008 |work=Wired News |publisher=Cond\u00e9Net |accessdate=2008-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215001128/http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/piezoelectric-n.html |archivedate=February 15, 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Yong Qin, Xudong Wang & Zhong Lin Wang|title=Letter/abstract: Microfibre\u2013nanowire hybrid structure for energy scavenging|journal=Nature|volume=451|pages=809\u2013813|doi=10.1038/nature06601|date=October 10, 2007|pmid=18273015|issue=7180|df=}} cited in {{cite web|title=Editor's summary: Nanomaterial: power dresser|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/edsumm/e080214-06.html|work=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185507/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/edsumm/e080214-06.html|archivedate=February 15, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Sources and types ==\nTextiles are made from many materials, with four main sources: animal ([[wool]], [[silk]]), plant ([[cotton]], [[flax]], [[jute]], [[bamboo textile|bamboo]]), mineral ([[asbestos]], [[glass (fiber)|glass fibre]]), and synthetic ([[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]], [[rayon]]). The first three are natural. In the 20th century, they were supplemented by artificial fibres made from [[petroleum]]. Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest [[microfibre]] made of strands thinner than one [[Units_of_textile_measurement#Denier|denier]] to the sturdiest [[canvas]]. [[Textile manufacturing terminology]] has a wealth of descriptive terms, from light [[gauze]]-like [[Gossamer (fabric)|gossamer]] to heavy [[grosgrain]] cloth and beyond.\n\n=== Animal ===\nAnimal textiles are commonly made from [[hair]], [[fur]], [[skin]] or [[silk]] (in the silkworms case).\n\n[[Wool]] refers to the hair of the domestic [[sheep]] or [[goat]], which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a [[wax]] mixture known as [[lanolin]] (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Woollen]] refers to a bulkier yarn produced from carded, non-parallel fibre, while [[worsted]] refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibers which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. [[Cashmere wool|Cashmere]], the hair of the Indian [[cashmere goat]], and [[mohair]], the hair of the North African [[angora goat]], are types of wool known for their softness.\n\nOther animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, [[Vicu\u00f1a|vicu\u00f1a wool]], llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[poncho]]s, [[blanket]]s, and other warm coverings. [[Angora wool|Angora]] refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the [[angora rabbit]]. [[Qiviut]] is the fine inner wool of the [[muskox]].\n\n[[Wadmal]] is a coarse cloth made of wool, produced in Scandinavia, mostly 1000~1500 CE.\n\n[[Sea silk]] is an extremely fine, rare, and valuable fabric that is made from the silky filaments or byssus secreted by a gland in the foot of pen shells.\n\nSilk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of the Chinese [[silkworm]] which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness.  There are two main types of the silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the [[Bombyx mori|Bombyx Mori]], and 'wild silk' such as [[Wild silk|Tussah silk]] (wild silk). Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trevisan |first=Adrian |title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture |url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture |publisher=Sense of Nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507085636/http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Plant ===\n[[File:Barong Up Close.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a [[Barong Tagalog]] made with [[pi\u00f1a]] fiber in the [[Philippines]].]]\n[[Poaceae|Grass]], [[Juncaceae|rush]], [[hemp]], and [[sisal]] are all used in making [[rope]]. In the first two, the entire plant is used for this purpose, while in the last two, only fibres from the plant are utilized. [[Coir]] ([[coconut]] fibre) is used in making [[twine]], and also in floormats, [[Mat|doormats]], [[brush]]es, [[mattress]]es, floor tiles, and [[Bag|sacking]].\n\n[[Straw]] and [[bamboo textiles|bamboo]] are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]].\n\nFibres from [[pulpwood]] trees, cotton, [[rice paper|rice]], hemp, and [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] are used in making [[paper]].\n\n[[Cotton]], [[Linen|flax]], jute, hemp, [[Modal (textile)|modal]] and even bamboo fibre are all used in clothing. [[Pi\u00f1a]] ([[pineapple]] fibre) and [[ramie]] are also fibres used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibres such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk fibre has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibres like hemp or flax.\n\nThe inner bark of the [[Lagetta lagetto|lacebark tree]] is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope.\n\n[[cellulose acetate|Acetate]] is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as [[silk]]s, [[velvet]]s, and [[taffeta]]s.\n\n[[Seaweed]] is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fibre known as [[Alginic acid|alginate]] is produced and is used as a holding fibre; when the cloth is finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area.\n\n[[Rayon]] is a manufactured fabric derived from plant pulp. Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.\n\nFibres from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also known as 'bast' fibres.\n\n=== Mineral ===\nAsbestos and [[basalt fibre]] are used for vinyl tiles, sheeting and adhesives, \"transite\" panels and siding, acoustical ceilings, stage curtains, and fire blankets.\n\n[[Glass fibre]] is used in the production of ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fibre for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibres. Glass fibres are woven and coated with [[Teflon]] to produce [[beta cloth]], a virtually fireproof fabric which replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States [[space suit]]s since 1968.{{Verify source|date=January 2018}}\n\nMetal fibre, metal foil, and metal wire have a variety of uses, including the production of [[cloth-of-gold]] and [[jewellery]]. [[Hardware cloth]] (US term only) is a coarse woven [[mesh]] of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard [[window screen]]ing, but heavier and with a more open weave.\n\nMinerals and natural and synthetic fabrics may be combined, as in [[emery cloth]], a layer of [[Emery (rock)|emery]] abrasive glued to a cloth backing.  Also, \"sand cloth\" is a U.S. term for fine wire mesh with abrasive glued to it, employed like emery cloth or coarse [[sandpaper]].\n\n=== Synthetic ===\n[[File:Cloth 800.jpg|thumb|A variety of contemporary fabrics.

Thicker nylon fibres are used in [[rope]] and outdoor clothing.\n\n[[Spandex]] (trade name ''Lycra'') is a [[polyurethane]] product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement.  It is used to make [[activewear]], [[Brassiere|bras]], and [[swimsuit]]s.\n\n[[Olefin fibre]] is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing.  Olefins are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly.  A sintered felt of olefin fibres is sold under the trade name [[Tyvek]].\n\n[[Ingeo]] is a [[polylactide]] fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing.  It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to wick away perspiration.\n\n[[Lurex (yarn)|Lurex]] is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.\n\n[[Milk]] proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or [[casein]] fibre cloth was developed during [[World War I]] in Germany, and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s.<ref>Euroflax Industries Ltd.

This is done on a frame or machine known as a [[loom]], of which there are a number of types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanized.\n\n[[Knitting]], [[Nalebinding|looping]], and [[crochet]]ing involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed either on a [[knitting needle]], needle, or on a [[crochet hook]], together in a line. The processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while Looping and crocheting never have more than one active loop on the needle. Knitting can be performed by machine, but crochet can only be performed by hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looping and Knitting|last=Rowe|first=Ann Pollard|publisher=The Textile Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n[[Spread Tow]] is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes, and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for composite materials; [[spread tow fabric]]s can be made in [[carbon]], [[aramide]], etc.\n\n[[Braid]]ing or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making [[tatting]] and [[macrame]].\n\n[[Lace]] is made by interlocking threads together independently, using a backing and any of the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.\n\n[[Carpet]]s, rugs, velvet, [[velour]], and [[velveteen]] are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a [[nap (textile)|nap]] or [[pile (textile)|pile]].\n\nFelting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together until they become tangled.  A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.\n\n[[Nonwoven]] textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric. Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.\n\n[[Barkcloth|Bark cloth]] is made by pounding bark until it is soft and flat.\n\n== Treatments ==\n[[File:Double ikat weaving from Sulu, Philippines, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|right|A double [[ikat]] weaving made by the [[Tausug people]] from [[Sulu]], made of banana leaf stalk fiber ([[Abac\u00e1]]).]]\nTextiles are often [[dyeing|dyed]], with fabrics available in almost every colour. The dyeing process often requires several dozen gallons of water for each pound of clothing.<ref>Green Inc.

[[Woodblock printing]], still used in India and elsewhere today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 CE in [[China]].  Textiles are also sometimes [[bleach]]ed, making the textile pale or white.\n\n[[File:GuatemalaWeavings79.jpg|thumb|Brilliantly dyed traditional woven textiles of [[Guatemala]], and woman weaving on a backstrap [[loom]]]]\nTextiles are sometimes finished by chemical processes to change their characteristics. In the 19th century and early 20th century [[starch]]ing was commonly used to make clothing more resistant to stains and wrinkles.\n\n[[Eisengarn]], meaning \"iron yarn\" in English, is a light-reflecting, strong material invented in [[Germany]] in the 19th century. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and paraffin wax solution.  The threads are then stretched and polished by steel rollers and brushes. The end result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant yarn which is extremely hardwearing.<ref name=history>[http://www.wuppertal.ihk24.de/servicemarken/branchen_neu/industrie/industrie_im_bs/902782/Textilstandort_Wuppertal.html ''Industriegeschichte aus dem Bergischen land''] (in German).
