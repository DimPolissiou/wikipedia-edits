However, when an AOL chat turns racy, she discovers masturbation and becomes guilt-ridden.

Wellcome M0010501.jpg|thumb|right]]'''Sydney Ringer''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (March 1835 \u2013 14 October 1910) was a British clinician, physiologist and pharmacologist, best known for inventing [[Ringer's solution]]. He was born in 1835 in [[Norwich, England|Norwich]], England and died following a stroke in 1910 in [[Lastingham]], [[Yorkshire|Yorkshire, England]]. His gravestone and some other records report 1835 for his birth, some census records and other documents suggest 1836, but his baptismal record at St Mary's Baptist Chapel (referred to in Ringer's own will) confirms this was 1835.\n\n==Life==\nBorn into a non-conformist family (often, but incorrectly described as '[[Quaker]]') in [[Norwich]], Ringer's father died in 1843, while he was still very young. His elder brother, John Melancthon, amassed a vast fortune in Shanghai, and his younger brother, Frederick, went to Japan, where he founded the company [[Holme, Ringer & Co]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and became so successful he was given the name \"King of Nagasaki\".\n\nRinger's entire professional career was associated with the [[University College Hospital]], London. He entered University College in 1854 and graduated M.B. in 1860, being a resident medical officer in the University Medical Hospital from 1861 to 1862. He gained his M.D. in 1863 and that same year was appointed as assistant physician to the hospital, becoming a full physician in 1866.{{sfn|Rolleston|1912}} From 1865 to 1869, he also held the position of assistant physician at the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street]].\n\nRinger was an outstanding bedside teacher who continued the high standard of clinical instruction that had been established at the University College Hospital. He was not, however, in his element in set lectures. Ringer served successively as professor of materia medica, [[pharmacology]] and therapeutics, and the principles and practice of medicine at the University College faculty of medicine. \nIn 1887, he was named [[Holme professor of clinical medicine]], a chair he held until his retirement in 1900. In 1870 he became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and in 1885 a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].{{sfn|Rolleston|1912}}\n\n''Ringer's Handbook of Therapeutics'' was a classic of its day and passed through thirteen editions between 1869 and 1897. This book was originally commissioned as a revision of [[Jonathan Pereira]]'s (1804\u20131853) massive ''Elements of Materia Medica'' (first edition from 1839), but Ringer was little concerned with the minutiae of traditional medical botany and materia medical. He offered instead a thoroughly practical treatise in which the actions and indications of drugs were concisely summarised.\n\nRinger was one of the early true clinical investigators. Patient care, clinical teaching, and writing occupied most of Ringer's career, but for many years he also maintained a small laboratory in the department of physiology; at that time there was no pharmacology laboratory at University College. He was universally known for his punctuality and the fanatical way he would spend every spare moment in his laboratory. It is even recorded that he climbed the palings of the hospital wall one evening when he found the door locked, to get to his laboratory. Following his morning round he would always make an appearance in the physiological laboratory and make suggestions to the laboratory assistant, examine the traces and then depart for his rooms at Cavendish Place, where he would do his consultant work.\n\nWith the aid of a series of collaborators, including E. G. A. Morshead, William Murrell (1853\u20131912), Harrington Sainsbury, and Dudley Buxton, Ringer published between 1875 and 1895 more than thirty papers devoted to the actions of inorganic salts on living tissues.\n\nIn the 1860s [[Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig]] had developed some perfusion techniques for the study of isolated organs. From the beginning the heart had served as the principal organ for these \"extravital\" investigations, and most of Ringer's physiological work relied on Ludwig's experimental model. In a classic series of experiments performed between 1882 and 1885, Ringer began with an isolated frog heart suspended in a 0.75% solution of sodium chloride. He then introduced additional substances (for example, blood and albumin) to the solution and observed the effects on the beating heart. He demonstrated that the abnormally prolonged ventricular dilation induced by pure sodium chloride solution is reversed by both blood and albumin. Ringer showed that small amounts of calcium in the perfusing solution are necessary for the maintenance of a normal heartbeat, a discovery he made after realising that instead of distilled water, his technician was actually using tap water containing (in London) calcium at nearly the same concentration as the blood. Ringer thus gradually perfected Ludwig's perfusion technique by proving that if small amounts of potassium are added to the normal solution of sodium chloride, isolated organs can be kept functional for long periods of time.\n\nThis formed the basis of [[Ringer's solution]], which became an immediate necessity for the physiological laboratory. Clinically important derivatives include [[Ringer's lactate]].\n\nIn 2007, a brief biography of Ringer<ref>[http://journals.physoc.org/site/misc/History/Digital_resources/A_Solution_for_the_Heart.pdf ''A Solution for the Heart''] (free pdf)</ref> was published by the Physiological Society, of which Ringer was an early member.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Dewolf | first1 = WC | title = Sydney Ringer (1835\u20131910) | journal = Investigative Urology | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 500\u20131 | year = 1977 | pmid = 323186}}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Sternbach | first1 = George | title = Sydney ringer: Water supplied by the new river water company | journal = Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 71\u20134 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3283218 | doi = 10.1016/0736-4679(88)90254-5}}\n*{{cite journal |title=Sydney Ringer, calcium, and cardiac function.|journal=Circulation|publisher=American Heart Association|first= W B|last= Fye|volume=69|issue=4|pages=849\u201353|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.69.4.849 |pmid=6365353|year=1984}}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = J.

Over the years there have been several petitions to reestablish the historical name ''Rixdorf''; cf. Kai Ritzmann, [https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/neukoelln/aus-nord-neukoelln-soll-wieder-rixdorf-werden \"Aus (Nord-)Neuk\u00f6lln soll wieder Rixdorf werden\"], 1 July 2019, ''[[B.Z. (newspaper)|B.Z.]]''.</ref> including the historic village of Alt-Rixdorf and numerous ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' apartment blocks. With 166,714 inhabitants (2018) the ''Ortsteil'' is the most densely populated of Berlin. It was originally characterized by mostly working-class inhabitants and later a relatively high percentage of immigrants, especially of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Russian people|Russian]] descent, but since the turn of the millennium an influx of students, creatives, and western immigrants has led to [[gentrification]].\n\n== Geography ==\nNeuk\u00f6lln lies on the geological border between the shallow ''Berliner [[Urstromtal]]'' glacial valley and the ''Tempelhofer Berge'',<ref>See also the ''[[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg]]'', which is Berlin's most prominent glacial hill in the ''Tempelhofer Berge'' range.</ref> which are situated in the northernmost region of the [[Teltow (region)|Teltow]] [[Moraine#Ground moraines|ground moraine]] plateau, rising to the south of [[Hermannplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hermannplatz]], in what is mostly the typical low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography of the [[North European Plain]].<ref>''See also'' [[Geography of Berlin]].</ref>\n\n[[File:Landwehrkanal 2005-06-24.jpg|thumb|left|Landwehrkanal (2005)]]\n\n=== Location ===\n[[File:HasenheideWinter.jpg|thumb|left|Hasenheide in winter (2013)]]\nThe district is situated south-east of the Berlin city center, in the north of the Neuk\u00f6lln borough, adjacent to the district of [[Kreuzberg]] (in the [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]] borough) at the [[Landwehrkanal]], and the streets ''Hasenheide'' and ''Kottbusser Damm''. It also borders with the districts [[Alt-Treptow]], [[Pl\u00e4nterwald]] and [[Baumschulenweg]] (all part of [[Treptow-K\u00f6penick]]) in the east, and [[Tempelhof]] (in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]]) in the west, separated by the parks ''Volkspark Hasenheide'' and ''[[Tempelhofer Feld]]'', the vast field of the former [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]], now a popular recreation area. In the south, the [[Bundesautobahn 100|Stadtring]] motorway and the [[Neuk\u00f6lln Ship Canal|Neuk\u00f6lln Ship]] and [[Britz Canal|Britz canals]] form the border with the [[Britz]] and Baumschulenweg districts.\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n==== Neighborhoods ====\n[[File:Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln Karte.png|thumb|left|Neighborhoods of Neuk\u00f6lln]]\nNeuk\u00f6lln is divided into nine official neighborhoods (''[[Kiez]]e'' or ''Stadtquartiere'', officially called ''Ortslagen''),<ref>Cf.

The other official neighborhoods are (from north to south):\n* '''Reuterkiez''',<ref>Also known as ''Reuterquartier''; together with the adjacent parts of [[Kreuzberg]] sometimes jokingly referred to as ''Kreuzk\u00f6lln'' (cf. Johannes Schneider, [https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/namen-fuer-berliner-kieze-sagt-endlich-kreuzkoelln/13422316.html \"Sagt endlich Kreuzk\u00f6lln!\"], 12 April 2016, ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]''), a [[portmanteau]] of \"''Kreuz''berg\" and \"Neu''k\u00f6lln''\", the former's ''SO 36'' and ''Kreuzberg 61'' quarters bordering to the north and west respectively.

At the western and eastern outskirts there are recreational spaces\u2014a large area of privately leased garden plots in the east, and the park '''Volkspark Hasenheide''' with surrounding buildings in the west\u2014, while industrial areas have formed mostly to the south and east of the [[Berlin Ringbahn]].\n\n==== Urban planning ====\nIn [[urban planning]], the divisions of Berlin's boroughs and districts are more precise. Here Neuk\u00f6lln, district 01 in borough 08, is divided into five regions, each of them further compartmentalized into a total of 18 so-called ''Lebensweltlich orientierte R\u00e4ume (LOR)'' (\"lifeworld-oriented regions\"):<ref>Amt f\u00fcr Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg, [https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Produkte/verzeichnisse/Adressverzeichnis_LOR_08.pdf \"Adressverzeichnisf\u00fcr die lebensweltlich orientierten R\u00e4ume\"], Berlin 2018; official neighborhoods '''emphasized'''.</ref>\n* ''Schillerpromenade'' (01) in the west, comprising Hasenheide (15), Wissmannstra\u00dfe (16), '''Schillerpromenade''' (17), and Silbersteinstra\u00dfe (18);\n* ''Neuk\u00f6llner Mitte'' (02) in the center, comprising '''Flughafenstra\u00dfe''' (11), '''Rollberg''' (12), '''K\u00f6rnerpark''' (13), and Glasower Stra\u00dfe (14);\n* ''Reuterstra\u00dfe'' (03) in the north, comprising '''Reuterkiez''' (01), Bouch\u00e9stra\u00dfe (02), and Donaustra\u00dfe (03);\n* ''Rixdorf'' (04) in the center to the north-east, comprising '''B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf''' and '''Richardplatz-S\u00fcd''' as ''Rixdorf'' (04), Hertzbergplatz (05), Treptower Stra\u00dfe Nord (06), and the industrial park Ederstra\u00dfe (07); and\n* ''K\u00f6llnische Heide'' (05) in the east, comprising '''Wei\u00dfe Siedlung''' (08), Schulenburgpark (09) including the '''High-Deck-Siedlung''', and the industrial park K\u00f6llnische Heide (10).\n\n== History ==\nIn the 12th century the region around modern-day Berlin came under German rule as part of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], founded by [[Albert the Bear]] in 1157. The region was originally situated near the borders to the [[Duchy of Kopanica]], ruled by [[Jaxa of K\u00f6penick]], and the Duchy of [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|Pomerania]], which had all fought for dominance during the colonization of the [[Teltow (region)|Teltow]] and the formation of [[Brandenburg]] (''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). Archeological traces of earlier [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlements were never found.\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe place later known as ''Rixdorf'' was founded around 1200 as a stronghold by the [[Knights Templar]] from neighbouring [[Tempelhof#History|Tempelhove]], [[Marienfelde#History|Merghenvelde]] and [[Mariendorf#History|Mergendorp]]. The Templar functioned as a neutral institution, and when the conflicts had ended, the stronghold was [[Abandoned village|abandoned]] and eventually converted into a Templar access yard. After [[Pope Clement V]] had dissolved the order in 1312, the estate was held by [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Waldemar the Great]] for six years, and then transferred to the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Order of Saint John]] (''Johanniterorden'') in 1318, still represented today by Neuk\u00f6lln's coat of arms bearing the [[Maltese cross]].\n\n[[File:Richardplatz1.JPG|thumb|left|Richardplatz]]\n\n=== Rixdorf ===\n[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_borough_Neukoelln.svg|thumb|right|Neuk\u00f6lln's coat of arms]]\nWhen first mentioned in a charter of June 26, 1360, the ''[[angerdorf]]'' south-east of Berlin around the present-day Richardplatz was called ''Richarsdorp'' (\"Richard's Village\"). The original Rixdorf charter has been lost since [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|World War II]], but its contents have been preserved, and the year 1360 is regarded as the official year of Neuk\u00f6lln's foundation.<ref>Cf. the 650-years anniversary edition [https://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/57-verein/mitteilungen/669-mitteilungen-2010-heft-3.html \"Rixdorf \u2013 650 \u2013 Neuk\u00f6lln\"] of ''Mitteilungen des Vereins f\u00fcr die Geschichte Berlins'' (Vol. 3, 2010).</ref> The village was mentioned again in 1375 as ''Richardstorpp'' in the ''Landbuch der Mark Brandenburg''. At the beginning of the 15th century, Richarsdorp erected its first chapel.<ref>Before 1400 the village had to pay tributes to the priest at Tempelhof, which rules out a church in Rixdorf during these early times.</ref> In 1435 the Johannite Order sold their possessions to the cities of [[Alt-Berlin]] and [[C\u00f6lln]], including Richarsdorp, which was mentioned again in 1525 as ''Ricksdorf''. In 1543 Ricksdorf became the sole possession of C\u00f6lln. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) Ricksdorf was mostly depopulated, with buildings and the church destroyed by fire. After the city of C\u00f6lln merged with Berlin in 1709, the village, then already called ''Rixdorf'', became the possession of Berlin.\n\n==== Deutsch-Rixdorf and B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf ====\nIn 1737 King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] allowed about 350 [[Moravian Church|Moravian Protestants]] expelled from [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] to settle near the village,<ref>Bohemia became primarily catholic again after the [[Battle of White Mountain]], which led to persecutions of the Protestant minority, many of whom subsequently left the country.</ref> where they built their own church and houses off the village centre along the road to Berlin, today called ''Richardstra\u00dfe''. The original village of ''Rixdorf'' was subsequently called ''Deutsch-Rixdorf''. The new Bohemian village ''B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf'' was granted its own constitution in 1797.\n\nThe overall population in 1809 was 695.<ref>Schneider R. 1993. ''Neuk\u00f6lln \u2013 Ein Bezirk von Berlin''. Berlin.</ref> In the course of industrialization in the 19th century, a network of new streets was laid out as part of the [[Hobrecht-Plan]] in an area that came to be known architecturally as the [[Wilhelmine Ring (Berlin)|Wilhelmine Ring]]. On 28 April 1849, more than a quarter of the buildings in both Rixdorf villages were destroyed in a firestorm, and reconstruction lasted until 1853. In 1863 a Turkish cemetery was laid out north of Rixdorf, the successor of a smaller burial ground in Kreuzberg established in 1798 for the Turkish members of the [[Prussian Army]]. It contains the mortal remains of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], the exiled Grand Vizier [[Mehmed Talat]] and [[Bahattin \u015eakir]].\n\nIn 1867 Deutsch-Rixdorf had a population of 5,000, and B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf of 1,500. When both villages were united as ''Rixdorf'' on January 1, 1874,<ref>By royal decree of July 11, 1873.</ref> the new town had 8,000 inhabitants, growing to 15,000 the next year. On April 1, 1899, Rixdorf, then the largest town of [[Prussia]], received the status of an [[independent city]].\n\n=== Neuk\u00f6lln ===\nRixdorf had become notorious for its taverns and amusement sites, and in 1912 the local authorities tried to get rid of this reputation by assuming the name ''Neuk\u00f6lln'', derived from the ''Neuc\u00f6llner Siedlungen'' (\"Neuc\u00f6lln Estates\") north of Rixdorf, which themselves referenced ''Neu-C\u00f6lln'', a historical district south of the [[Alt-Berlin|medieval part of Berlin]] and [[C\u00f6lln#History|C\u00f6lln]] proper.<ref>The historical Neu-C\u00f6lln (sometimes ''Neu-C\u00f6ln'' or ''neu C\u00f6lln'') was at first also called ''Neu-C\u00f6lln am Wasser'' (\"New C\u00f6lln by the water\"). It was built in 1662 as the southern extension of the city of C\u00f6lln, and remained a small district of Berlin until the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, when it was dissolved in the new [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district of the [[Mitte|homonymous borough]]. Today the area is part of the ''Luisenstadt'' neighborhood (named after the [[Luisenstadt|historical Luisenstadt]]), and it is almost never called by its historical name, but places like the [[K\u00f6llnischer Park]], originally a military bastion in Neu-C\u00f6lln, still point to the origin of the toponym ''Neuk\u00f6lln''.</ref> The renaming was eventually granted by [[William I, German Emperor|Emperor William I]] on January 27, 1912. It was during this time that the architect Reinhold Kiehl was called on by the local council to upgrade the city's infrastructure. This has led to some of the area's most iconic buildings being erected, such as the ''Rathaus Neuk\u00f6lln'' (city hall) or the ''Stadtbad Neuk\u00f6lln'' (public bath).<ref>Krawczynski, Wolfgang. ''Architekt Reinhold Kiehl, Stadtbaurat in Rixdorf bei Berlin: Biographie, Werkverzeichnis, Beitr\u00e4ge : Jubil\u00e4umsbeitrag zur 750-Jahr-Feier Berlin''. 1987</ref>\n\nNeuk\u00f6lln's independence ended in 1920 when it was incorporated into Berlin as part of the [[Greater Berlin Act]] and, together with the districts [[Britz]], [[Rudow]] and [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], formed the new borough of [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], Berlin's 14th (and since the 2001 reform 8th) administrative district. Rixdorf continued to exist, and is today represented by two neighborhoods in the center of Neuk\u00f6lln, B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf and Richardplatz-S\u00fcd. Many of the old landmarks are still intact, and several areas and streets like the Bohemian Kirchgasse have retained their idyllic and rural character.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P046278, Berlin, Blutmai, Stra\u00dfenbarrikade.jpg|thumb|left|''Bloody May'' barricades at the Briesestra\u00dfe]]\n\n=== Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln ===\nIn the [[Weimar Republic]] Neuk\u00f6lln remained a working-class district and [[Communism|communist]] stronghold. This led to increasing tensions between left-wing radicals like the [[German Communist Party|KPD]] and the Berlin police, culminating in the ''[[Blutmai|Bloody May]]'' riots of 1929 (''Blutmai''). The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] viewed the district as \"Red Neuk\u00f6lln\", and tensions with the rivaling [[Socialism|socialist]] and communist groups ensued as early as November 1926, when [[Joseph Goebbels]] sent over 300 men of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (''SA'') on a [[propaganda]] march through Neuk\u00f6lln, ending in clashes on the Hermannplatz. The conflict intensified until the end of the republic, leading to occasional armed engagements like the Rixdorf shootout of October 1931, when communists attacked the ''Richardsburg'', a ''Sturmlokal'' of the SA. After the National Socialists' rise to power in 1933, the SA extended their campaigns and also targeted rallies and events by moderate parties like the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]].<ref>Bernhard Sauer, [http://www.bernhard-sauer-historiker.de/Bernhard_Sauer-Geschichte_der_SA_in_BerlinBrandenburg.pdf \"Goebbels 'Rabauken': Zur Geschichte der SA in Berlin-Brandenburg\"], in: Landesarchiv Berlin, ''Berlin in Geschichte und Gegenwart.

The [[Sonnenallee, Berlin|Sonnenallee]], connecting Neuk\u00f6lln at [[Hermannplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hermannplatz]] with Baumschulenweg in former [[East Berlin]], was the site of a [[Berlin border crossings|border crossing]] of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref>Featured prominently in the 1999 comedy film ''[[Sonnenallee]]''.</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Neuk\u00f6lln retained its status as a traditional working-class area and one of Berlin's red-light districts. Many ''[[gastarbeiter]]'', especially from Turkey and Greece, settled in Kreuzberg and Neuk\u00f6lln since the 1950s, later followed by [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] and [[Arabs in Berlin|Arabic]] refugees from the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Since the 1970s and 80s, Neuk\u00f6lln, like the neighboring Kreuzberg, has embraced [[Squatting#Germany|alternative forms of living]] and an often [[anti-establishment]] culture that is still vibrant to this day. In the 1990s [[Repatriation|late repatriates]] from formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states like [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] resettled in Germany, many of them in Berlin, and in Neuk\u00f6lln specifically.\n\nFollowing a decade as a typical inner-city hot spot, 21st century Neuk\u00f6lln has experienced an influx of students, [[Creative class|creatives]] and other young professionals of mostly [[Western culture|Western]] origin avoiding higher rents charged in other parts of Berlin. The trend increased after the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|2008 financial]] and [[European debt crisis|2010 European debt crises]], when many young [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] left their home countries for Germany in search of work, leading to rapid cultural shifts in certain neighborhoods within Neuk\u00f6lln, especially the neighborhoods to the north and west from Reuter- to Schillerkiez. Coupled with increasing domestic and foreign real estate investments, this has caused [[gentrification]] and a knock-on effect of rents to rise in many parts of Neuk\u00f6lln.<ref name=gent>Moises Mendoza, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/neukoelln-nasties-foreigners-feel-accused-in-berlin-gentrification-row-a-750297.html \"Foreigners Feel Accused in Berlin Gentrification Row\"], 11 March 2011, ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref><ref>As of 2017, in Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln \"the [gentrification] boom [was] in full swing or, in some places, complete (no more big hikes in rent here)\"; cf.

Here Neuk\u00f6lln, district 01 in borough 08, is divided into five regions, each of them further compartmentalized into a total of 18 so-called ''Lebensweltlich orientierte R\u00e4ume (LOR)'' (\"lifeworld-oriented regions\"):<ref>Amt f\u00fcr Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg, [https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Produkte/verzeichnisse/Adressverzeichnis_LOR_08.pdf \"Adressverzeichnisf\u00fcr die lebensweltlich orientierten R\u00e4ume\"], Berlin 2018; official neighborhoods '''emphasized'''.</ref>\n* ''Schillerpromenade'' (01) in the west, comprising Hasenheide (15), Wissmannstra\u00dfe (16), '''Schillerpromenade''' (17), and Silbersteinstra\u00dfe (18);\n* ''Neuk\u00f6llner Mitte'' (02) in the center, comprising '''Flughafenstra\u00dfe''' (11), '''Rollberg''' (12), '''K\u00f6rnerpark''' (13), and Glasower Stra\u00dfe (14);\n* ''Reuterstra\u00dfe'' (03) in the north, comprising '''Reuterkiez''' (01), Bouch\u00e9stra\u00dfe (02), and Donaustra\u00dfe (03);\n* ''Rixdorf'' (04) in the center to the north-east, comprising '''B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf''' and '''Richardplatz-S\u00fcd''' as ''Rixdorf'' (04), Hertzbergplatz (05), Treptower Stra\u00dfe Nord (06), and the industrial park Ederstra\u00dfe (07); and\n* ''K\u00f6llnische Heide'' (05) in the east, comprising '''Wei\u00dfe Siedlung''' (08), Schulenburgpark (09) including the '''High-Deck-Siedlung''', and the industrial park K\u00f6llnische Heide (10).\n\n== History ==\nIn the 12th century the region around modern-day Berlin came under German rule as part of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], founded by [[Albert the Bear]] in 1157. The region was originally situated near the borders to the [[Duchy of Kopanica]], ruled by [[Jaxa of K\u00f6penick]], and the Duchy of [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|Pomerania]], which had all fought for dominance during the colonization of the [[Teltow (region)|Teltow]] and the formation of [[Brandenburg]] (''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). Archeological traces of earlier [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlements were never found.\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe place later known as ''Rixdorf'' was founded around 1200 as a stronghold by the [[Knights Templar]] from neighbouring [[Tempelhof#History|Tempelhove]], [[Marienfelde#History|Merghenvelde]] and [[Mariendorf#History|Mergendorp]]. The Templar functioned as a neutral institution, and when the conflicts had ended, the stronghold was [[Abandoned village|abandoned]] and eventually converted into a Templar access yard. After [[Pope Clement V]] had dissolved the order in 1312, the estate was held by [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Waldemar the Great]] for six years, and then transferred to the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Order of Saint John]] (''Johanniterorden'') in 1318, still represented today by Neuk\u00f6lln's coat of arms bearing the [[Maltese cross]].\n\n[[File:Richardplatz1.JPG|thumb|left|Richardplatz]]\n\n=== Rixdorf ===\n[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_borough_Neukoelln.svg|thumb|right|Neuk\u00f6lln's coat of arms]]\nWhen first mentioned in a charter of June 26, 1360, the ''[[angerdorf]]'' south-east of Berlin around the present-day Richardplatz was called ''Richarsdorp'' (\"Richard's Village\"). The original Rixdorf charter has been lost since [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|World War II]], but its contents have been preserved, and the year 1360 is regarded as the official year of Neuk\u00f6lln's foundation.<ref>Cf. the 650-years anniversary edition [https://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/57-verein/mitteilungen/669-mitteilungen-2010-heft-3.html \"Rixdorf \u2013 650 \u2013 Neuk\u00f6lln\"] of ''Mitteilungen des Vereins f\u00fcr die Geschichte Berlins'' (Vol. 3, 2010).</ref> The village was mentioned again in 1375 as ''Richardstorpp'' in the ''Landbuch der Mark Brandenburg''. At the beginning of the 15th century, Richarsdorp erected its first chapel.<ref>Before 1400 the village had to pay tributes to the priest at Tempelhof, which rules out a church in Rixdorf during these early times.</ref> In 1435 the Johannite Order sold their possessions to the cities of [[Alt-Berlin]] and [[C\u00f6lln]], including Richarsdorp, which was mentioned again in 1525 as ''Ricksdorf''. In 1543 Ricksdorf became the sole possession of C\u00f6lln. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) Ricksdorf was mostly depopulated, with buildings and the church destroyed by fire. After the city of C\u00f6lln merged with Berlin in 1709, the village, then already called ''Rixdorf'', became the possession of Berlin.\n\n==== Deutsch-Rixdorf and B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf ====\nIn 1737 King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] allowed about 350 [[Moravian Church|Moravian Protestants]] expelled from [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] to settle near the village,<ref>Bohemia became primarily catholic again after the [[Battle of White Mountain]], which led to persecutions of the Protestant minority, many of whom subsequently left the country.</ref> where they built their own church and houses off the village centre along the road to Berlin, today called ''Richardstra\u00dfe''. The original village of ''Rixdorf'' was subsequently called ''Deutsch-Rixdorf''. The new Bohemian village ''B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf'' was granted its own constitution in 1797.\n\nThe overall population in 1809 was 695.<ref>Schneider R. 1993. ''Neuk\u00f6lln \u2013 Ein Bezirk von Berlin''. Berlin.</ref> In the course of industrialization in the 19th century, a network of new streets was laid out as part of the [[Hobrecht-Plan]] in an area that came to be known architecturally as the [[Wilhelmine Ring (Berlin)|Wilhelmine Ring]]. On 28 April 1849, more than a quarter of the buildings in both Rixdorf villages were destroyed in a firestorm, and reconstruction lasted until 1853. In 1863 a Turkish cemetery was laid out north of Rixdorf, the successor of a smaller burial ground in Kreuzberg established in 1798 for the Turkish members of the [[Prussian Army]]. It contains the mortal remains of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], the exiled Grand Vizier [[Mehmed Talat]] and [[Bahattin \u015eakir]].\n\nIn 1867 Deutsch-Rixdorf had a population of 5,000, and B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf of 1,500. When both villages were united as ''Rixdorf'' on January 1, 1874,<ref>By royal decree of July 11, 1873.</ref> the new town had 8,000 inhabitants, growing to 15,000 the next year. On April 1, 1899, Rixdorf, then the largest town of [[Prussia]], received the status of an [[independent city]].\n\n=== Neuk\u00f6lln ===\nRixdorf had become notorious for its taverns and amusement sites, and in 1912 the local authorities tried to get rid of this reputation by assuming the name ''Neuk\u00f6lln'', derived from the ''Neuc\u00f6llner Siedlungen'' (\"Neuc\u00f6lln Estates\") north of Rixdorf, which themselves referenced ''Neu-C\u00f6lln'', a historical district south of the [[Alt-Berlin|medieval part of Berlin]] and [[C\u00f6lln#History|C\u00f6lln]] proper.<ref>The historical Neu-C\u00f6lln (sometimes ''Neu-C\u00f6ln'' or ''neu C\u00f6lln'') was at first also called ''Neu-C\u00f6lln am Wasser'' (\"New C\u00f6lln by the water\"). It was built in 1662 as the southern extension of the city of C\u00f6lln, and remained a small district of Berlin until the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, when it was dissolved in the new [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district of the [[Mitte|homonymous borough]]. Today the area is part of the ''Luisenstadt'' neighborhood (named after the [[Luisenstadt|historical Luisenstadt]]), and it is almost never called by its historical name, but places like the [[K\u00f6llnischer Park]], originally a military bastion in Neu-C\u00f6lln, still point to the origin of the toponym ''Neuk\u00f6lln''.</ref> The renaming was eventually granted by [[William I, German Emperor|Emperor William I]] on January 27, 1912. It was during this time that the architect Reinhold Kiehl was called on by the local council to upgrade the city's infrastructure. This has led to some of the area's most iconic buildings being erected, such as the ''Rathaus Neuk\u00f6lln'' (city hall) or the ''Stadtbad Neuk\u00f6lln'' (public bath).<ref>Krawczynski, Wolfgang. ''Architekt Reinhold Kiehl, Stadtbaurat in Rixdorf bei Berlin: Biographie, Werkverzeichnis, Beitr\u00e4ge : Jubil\u00e4umsbeitrag zur 750-Jahr-Feier Berlin''. 1987</ref>\n\nNeuk\u00f6lln's independence ended in 1920 when it was incorporated into Berlin as part of the [[Greater Berlin Act]] and, together with the districts [[Britz]], [[Rudow]] and [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], formed the new borough of [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], Berlin's 14th (and since the 2001 reform 8th) administrative district. Rixdorf continued to exist, and is today represented by two neighborhoods in the center of Neuk\u00f6lln, B\u00f6hmisch-Rixdorf and Richardplatz-S\u00fcd. Many of the old landmarks are still intact, and several areas and streets like the Bohemian Kirchgasse have retained their idyllic and rural character.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P046278, Berlin, Blutmai, Stra\u00dfenbarrikade.jpg|thumb|left|''Bloody May'' barricades at the Briesestra\u00dfe]]\n\n=== Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln ===\nIn the [[Weimar Republic]] Neuk\u00f6lln remained a working-class district and [[Communism|communist]] stronghold. This led to increasing tensions between left-wing radicals like the [[German Communist Party|KPD]] and the Berlin police, culminating in the ''[[Blutmai|Bloody May]]'' riots of 1929 (''Blutmai''). The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] viewed the district as \"Red Neuk\u00f6lln\", and tensions with the rivaling [[Socialism|socialist]] and communist groups ensued as early as November 1926, when [[Joseph Goebbels]] sent over 300 men of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (''SA'') on a [[propaganda]] march through Neuk\u00f6lln, ending in clashes on the Hermannplatz. The conflict intensified until the end of the republic, leading to occasional armed engagements like the Rixdorf shootout of October 1931, when communists attacked the ''Richardsburg'', a ''Sturmlokal'' of the SA. After the National Socialists' rise to power in 1933, the SA extended their campaigns and also targeted rallies and events by moderate parties like the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]].<ref>Bernhard Sauer, [http://www.bernhard-sauer-historiker.de/Bernhard_Sauer-Geschichte_der_SA_in_BerlinBrandenburg.pdf \"Goebbels 'Rabauken': Zur Geschichte der SA in Berlin-Brandenburg\"], in: Landesarchiv Berlin, ''Berlin in Geschichte und Gegenwart.

The [[Sonnenallee, Berlin|Sonnenallee]], connecting Neuk\u00f6lln at [[Hermannplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hermannplatz]] with Baumschulenweg in former [[East Berlin]], was the site of a [[Berlin border crossings|border crossing]] of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref>Featured prominently in the 1999 comedy film ''[[Sonnenallee]]''.</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Neuk\u00f6lln retained its status as a traditional working-class area and one of Berlin's red-light districts. Many ''[[gastarbeiter]]'', especially from Turkey and Greece, settled in Kreuzberg and Neuk\u00f6lln since the 1950s, later followed by [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] and [[Arabs in Berlin|Arabic]] refugees from the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Since the 1970s and 80s, Neuk\u00f6lln, like the neighboring Kreuzberg, has embraced [[Squatting#Germany|alternative forms of living]] and an often [[anti-establishment]] culture that is still vibrant to this day. In the 1990s [[Repatriation|late repatriates]] from formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states like [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] resettled in Germany, many of them in Berlin, and in Neuk\u00f6lln specifically.\n\nFollowing a decade as a typical inner-city hot spot, 21st century Neuk\u00f6lln has experienced an influx of students, [[Creative class|creatives]] and other young professionals of mostly [[Western culture|Western]] origin avoiding higher rents charged in other parts of Berlin. The trend increased after the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|2008 financial]] and [[European debt crisis|2010 European debt crises]], when many young [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] left their home countries for Germany in search of work, leading to rapid cultural shifts in certain neighborhoods within Neuk\u00f6lln, especially the neighborhoods to the north and west from Reuter- to Schillerkiez. Coupled with increasing domestic and foreign real estate investments, this has caused [[gentrification]] and a knock-on effect of rents to rise in many parts of Neuk\u00f6lln.<ref name=gent>Moises Mendoza, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/neukoelln-nasties-foreigners-feel-accused-in-berlin-gentrification-row-a-750297.html \"Foreigners Feel Accused in Berlin Gentrification Row\"], 11 March 2011, ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref><ref>As of 2017, in Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln \"the [gentrification] boom [was] in full swing or, in some places, complete (no more big hikes in rent here)\"; cf.

She received a well-rounded education that included the [[fine art]]s, and her apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art. As a young woman, Anguissola traveled to [[Rome]] where she was introduced to [[Michelangelo]], who immediately recognized her talent, and to [[Milan]], where she painted the [[Duke of Alba]]. The Spanish queen, [[Elizabeth of Valois]], was a keen amateur painter and in 1559 Anguissola was recruited to go to [[Madrid]] as her tutor, with the rank of [[lady-in-waiting]]. She later became an official court painter to the king, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and adapted her style to the more formal requirements of official portraits for the Spanish court. After the queen's death, Philip helped arrange an aristocratic marriage for her. She moved to [[Sicily]], and later [[Pisa]] and [[Genoa]], where she continued to practice as a leading [[portrait painter]].\n\nHer most distinctive and attractive [[paintings]] are her portraits of herself and her family, which she painted before she moved to the Spanish court. In particular, her depictions of children were fresh and closely observed.  At the Spanish court she painted formal state portraits in the prevailing official style, as one of the first, and most successful, of the relatively few female [[court painter]]s.  Later in her life she also painted religious subjects, although many of her [[Christian art|religious paintings]] have been lost. In 1625, she died at age 93 in [[Palermo]].\n\nAnguissola's example, as much as her oeuvre, had a lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists, and her great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists. Her paintings can be seen at galleries in [[Boston]] ([[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]]); [[Milwaukee]] ([[Milwaukee Art Museum]]); [[Bergamo]]; [[Brescia]]; [[Budapest]]; [[Madrid]] ([[Museo del Prado]]); [[Naples]]; [[Siena]]; and at the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]].\n\nHer contemporary [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote that Anguissola \"has shown greater application and better grace than any other woman of our age in her endeavors at [[drawing]]; she has thus succeeded not only in drawing, coloring and painting from nature, and copying excellently from others, but by herself has created rare and very beautiful paintings.\"<ref name=\"Vasari-36\">Vasari. p. 36</ref>  \n\n==Family==\n[[Image:Sofonisba Anguissola, Portr\u00e6tgruppe med kunstnerens fader Amilcare Anguissola og hendes s\u00f8skende Minerva og Astrubale, ca. 1559, 0001NMK, Nivaagaards Malerisamling.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Portrait of the Artist's Family|Family Portrait, Minerva, Amilcare and Asdrubale Anguissola]]'', c.1559]]\n\nThe origin and the name of the noble [[:it:Anguissola|<u>it:Anguissola</u>]] family are linked to an ancient Byzantine tradition, rich in historical details.<ref name=\"servizi.ct2.it\">{{Cite web | url=https://servizi.ct2.it/ssl/wiki/index.php?title=Anguissola | title=Anguissola \u2013 EFL \u2013 Societ\u00e0 Storica Lombarda}}</ref>\n\nAccording to this tradition, the Anguissolas are descended from the Constantinopolitan warlord Galvano Sordo or Galvano de Soardi/Sourdi (\u03a3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b4\u03b7, a family name still in use today in Greece, Constantinople and Smyrne).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gamberini|first=Cecilia|title=\"Sofonisba Anguissola at the Court of Philip II\" in Women artists in Early Modern Italy, ed by Sheila Barker, Brepols 2016|url=https://www.academia.edu/10375100|journal=\"Sofonisba Anguissola at the Court of Philip II\" in Women Artists in Early Modern Italy, ed by Sheila Barkes, Brepols 2016|language=en}}</ref> In 717, Galvano served in the army of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian]], and \"with an ingenious artificial fire, contributed to [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|liberate the city of Constantinople]] from the Saracens who had kept it besieged by land and sea\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_diNLAAAAYAAJ |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_diNLAAAAYAAJ/page/n537 32] |title=Repertorio genealogico delle famiglie confermate nobili e dei titolati nobili esistenti nelle provincie venete...|last=Schroeder|first=Franz|date=1830|publisher=Alvisopoli|language=it}}</ref> This \u201cartificial fire\u201d was the so-called [[Greek fire]], an incendiary weapon developed in the late 7th century, which was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of Constantinople from two [[Siege of Constantinople (674\u2013678)|Arab sieges]], thus securing the Empire's survival.\n[[File:Sofonisba Anguissola - Self-Portrait - c. 1556.jpg|alt=|thumbs, sabrinan carpenter|213x213px|[https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/self-portrait-33656 Miniature self portrait, 1556.

Her training was not to help her into a profession where she would compete for commissions with male artists, but to make her a better wife, companion, and mother.<ref>Sylvia Ferino-Pagden and Maria Kusche, Sofonisba Anguissola: A Renaissance Woman, (Washington D.C.: The National Museum of Women in the Arts, 1995).</ref> Although Anguissola enjoyed significantly more encouragement and support than the average woman of her day, her social class did not allow her to transcend the constraints of her sex. Without the possibility of studying anatomy or drawing from life (it was considered unacceptable for a lady to view nudes), she could not undertake the complex multi-figure compositions required for large-scale religious or [[history painting]]s.\n\nInstead, she experimented with new styles of portraiture, setting subjects informally. Self-portraits and family members were her most frequent subjects, as seen in such paintings as ''Self-Portrait'' (1554, Kunsthistorisches Museum, [[Vienna]]), ''Portrait of Amilcare, Minerva and Asdrubale Anguissola'' (c. 1557\u20131558, Nivaagaards Malerisambling, Niva, Denmark), and her most famous picture, ''The Chess Game'' (1555, Muzeum Narodowe, Pozna\u0144), which depicted her sisters Lucia, Minerva and Europa. Painted when Sofonisba was 23 years old, ''The Chess Game'' is an intimate representation of an everyday family scene, combining elaborate formal clothing with very informal facial expressions, which was unusual for Italian art at this time. ''The Chess Game'' explored a new kind of genre painting which places her sitters in a domestic setting instead of the formal or allegorical settings that were popular at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Old mistresses : women, art, and ideology|last=Rozsika|first=Parker|others=Pollock, Griselda|isbn=0710008791|location=London|oclc=8160325|date = 29 October 1981}}</ref> This painting has been regarded as a [[conversation piece]], which is an informal portrait of a group engaging in lively conversation or some activity .\n\nAnguissola's self-portraits also offer evidence of what she thought her place was as a woman artist. Normally, men were seen as creative actors and women as passive objects, but in her self-portrait of 1556, Anguissola presents herself as the artist, separating herself from the role as the object to be painted.<ref>Mary Garrard, \"Here's Looking at Me: Sofonisba Anguissola and the Problem of the Woman Artist,\" Renaissance Quarterly 47, no. 3:(1994): 556.</ref> Additional pieces show how she rebels against the notion that women are objects, in essence an instrument to be played by men.

Queen Elisabeth of Valois and Sofonisba became good friends, and when the Queen died nine years later, Sofonisba left the court because she was so sad.

In the winter of 1559\u20131560, she arrived in [[Madrid]] to serve as a court painter and lady-in-waiting to the new queen, [[Elisabeth of Valois]], Philip\u2019s third wife, who was herself an amateur portraitist. Anguissola soon gained Elisabeth's admiration and confidence and spent the following years painting many official portraits for the court, including Philip II\u2019s sister, [[Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Joanna]], and his son, [[Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Don Carlos]].\n\nThese types of paintings were far more demanding than the informal portraits upon which Anguissola had based her early reputation, as it took a tremendous amount of time and energy to render the many intricate designs of the fine fabrics and elaborate jewelry associated with royal subjects. Yet despite the challenge, Anguissola's paintings of Elisabeth of Valois \u2013 and later of [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)|Anne of Austria]], Philip II\u2019s fourth wife \u2013 were vibrant and full of life.\n[[Image:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|271x271px|The Prado Philip&nbsp;II, now recognised as by Anguissola|alt=]]\n\nDuring her 14-year residence, she guided the artistic development of Queen Elisabeth, and influenced the art made by her two daughters, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] and [[Catherine Michelle]]. Anguissola painted a portrait of the King's sister, [[Margaret of Parma]], for [[Pope Pius IV]] in 1561 and, after Queen Elisabeth 's death in childbirth in 1568, painted the likeness of Anne of Austria, Philip's fourth wife.

He had wished to marry her to one of the nobles in the Spanish Court. In 1571, when she was approaching the age of 40, Anguissola entered an arranged marriage to a Sicilian nobleman chosen for her by the Spanish court.<ref name=\":1\" /> Philip II paid a dowry of 12,000 scudi for her marriage to [[:it:Fabrizio Moncada|Fabrizio Moncada Pignatelli]], son of the Prince of Patern\u00f2, Viceroy of [[Sicily]]. Fabrizio was said to be supportive of her painting. Anguissola and her husband left Spain with the king's permission, and are believed to have lived in Patern\u00f2 (near Catania) from 1573 to 1579, though some recent scholarship has suggested that the couple remained in Spain.<ref name=\":0\" /> She received a royal pension of 100 ducats that enabled her to continue working and tutoring would-be painters. Her private fortune also supported her family and brother Asdrubale following Amilcare Anguissola's financial decline and death. In Patern\u00f2 she painted and donated \"La Madonna dell'Itria\".\n\nAnguissola's husband died in 1579 under mysterious circumstances.<ref name=\":1\" /> Two years later, while traveling to Cremona by sea, she fell in love with the ship's captain, sea merchant Orazio Lomellino.<ref name=\":0\" /> Against the wishes of her brother, they married in Pisa on 24 December 1584<ref name=\"Tanzi_Oxford\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> and lived in Genoa until 1620. She had no children, but maintained cordial relationships with her nieces and her stepson, Giulio.\n\n==Later years==\nLomellino's fortune, plus a generous pension from Philip II, allowed Anguissola to paint freely and live comfortably. By now quite famous, Anguissola received many colleagues who came to visit and discuss the arts with her. Several of these were younger artists, eager to learn and mimic Anguissola's distinctive style.\n\nIn her later life, Anguissola painted not only portraits but religious themes, as she had done in the days of her youth, although many of the latter have been lost. She was the leading portrait painter in Genoa until she moved to [[Palermo]] in her last years. In 1620 she painted her last self-portrait.\n[[Image:Sofonisba-Anguissola-by-Van-Dyck.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony van Dyck]], portrait of Sofonisba in 1624, when she was 92 and, according to Van Dyck's notes, mentally still very sharp.]]\nOn 12 July 1624, Anguissola was visited by the young Flemish painter [[Anthony van Dyck]], who recorded sketches from his visit to her in his sketchbook.<ref>Jaff\u00e9, Michael. \"Dyck, Anthony van.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Her work was akin to the worldly tradition of Cremona, influenced greatly by the art of Parma and Mantua, in which even religious works were imbued with extreme delicacy and charm. From Gatti she seems to have absorbed elements reminiscent of [[Correggio]], beginning a trend in Cremonese painting of the late 16th century. This new direction is reflected in ''Lucia, Minerva and Europa Anguissola Playing Chess'' (1555; Pozna\u0144, N. Mus.) in which portraiture merges into a quasi-[[genre works|genre]] scene, a characteristic derived from Brescian models.\n\nThe main body of Anguissola's earlier work consists of self-portraits (the many \"autoritratti\" reflect the fact that portraits of her were frequently requested due to her fame) and portraits of her family, which are considered by many to be her finest works.\n\nApproximately fifty works have been attributed to Anguissola.

Her portrait of Queen Elisabeth of Valois with a [[zibellino]] (the pelt of a marten set with a head and feet of jewelled gold) was widely copied by many of the finest artists of the time, such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]], while [[Caravaggio]] allegedly took inspiration from Anguissola's work for his ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnguissola is significant to feminist art historians. Although there has never been a period in Western history in which women were completely absent in the visual arts, Anguissola's great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists; [[Lavinia Fontana]] expressed in a letter written in 1579 that she and another woman, [[Irene di Spilimbergo]], had \u201cset [their] heart[s] on learning how to paint\u201d after seeing one of Anguissola\u2019s portraits.<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Frederika H.|title=Woman's Capacity to Create: The Unusual Case of Sofonisba Anguissola|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=1994|volume=47|issue=1|pages=74\u2013101|jstor=2863112|doi=10.2307/2863112}}</ref> Some of her more well-known successors include [[Lavinia Fontana]], [[Barbara Longhi]], [[Fede Galizia]] and [[Artemisia Gentileschi]].\n\nA Cremonese school bears the name Liceo Statale Sofonisba Anguissola.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biography.yourdictionary.com/sofonisba-anguissola|title=Sofonisba Anguissola Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n==Crater==\nOn 4 August 2017 a crater on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was named after her.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15621?__fsk=1618881824 | title=Planetary Names: Crater, craters: Anguissola on Mercury}}</ref>\n\n== Recent exhibits ==\n\n* 2019-2020: Anguissola, along with [[Lavinia Fontana]], were the focus of a major exhibit entitled \u201cA Tale of Two Women Painters\u201d at the Museo del [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], Madrid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/whats-on/exhibition/a-tale-of-two-women-painters-sofonisba-anguissola/5f6c56c8-e81a-bf38-5f3f-9a2c2f5c60eb|title=Prado, exhibit site|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Sophonisba Angussola |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=47 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Sophonisba Angussola |volume=2 |ref={{harvid|EB|1911}} |page=44}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Whitney|title=Women, Art, and Society|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|pages=|year=1990|isbn=978-0-500-20354-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/womenartsociety3edchad}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Ferino-Pagden|first=Sylvia|last2=Kusche|first2=Maria|title=Sofonisba Anguissola: A Renaissance Woman|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts|year=1995|isbn=978-0-940979-31-4|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Harris|first=Ann Sutherland|last2=Nochlin|first2=Linda|title=Women Artists: 1550\u20131950|publisher=Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Knopf|location=New York|pages=|year=1976|isbn=978-0-394-41169-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/womenartists155000harr}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Perlingieri|first=Ilya Sandra|title=Sofonisba Anguissola: The First Great Woman Artist of the Renaissance|publisher=Rizzoli International|year=1992|isbn=978-0-8478-1544-9|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Pizzagalli|first=Daniela|title=La signora della pittura: vita di Sofonisba Anguissola, gentildonna e artista nel Rinascimento|pages=|language=Italian|trans-title=The Lady of the Painting: The Life of Sofonisba Anguissola, Gentlewoman and Artist of the Renaissance|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milan|year=2003|isbn=978-88-17-99509-2}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Boullosa |first=Carmen |title=La virgen y el viol\u00edn |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Virgin and the Violin |publisher=Madrid: Editorial Siruela; Mexico: Debolsillo, Random House Mondadori}} (a novel on Sofonisba Anguissola's life)\n* Fredrika Jacobs, \"Woman's capacity to create: The unusual case of Sofonisba Anguissola\", ''ibid.'', pp.&nbsp;74\u2013101\n* ''Sofonisba Anguissola: A Renaissance Woman,'' exh. cat., National Museum of Women in Arts, Washington, DC, 1995\n* Charles de Tolnay, \"Sofonisba Anguissola and her relations with Michelango\", ''Journal of the Walters Art Gallery,'' iv, 1941, pp.&nbsp;115\u201319\n* Flavio Caroli, ''Sofonisba Anguissola e le sue sorelle,'' Milan: Mondadori, 1987\n* Mary Garrard, \"Here's looking at me: Sofonisba Anguissola and the problem of the woman artist\", ''Renaissance Quarterly, xlvii,'' 1994, pp.&nbsp;556\u2013622\n* Francesco Giordano, ''Sofonisba Anguissola: una vita per la pittura'', I Paternesi de La Sicilia, Catania 29 giugno 2006\n* Francesco Giordano, ''Sofonisba Anguissola a Patern\u00f2'', Ricerche-C.R.E.S.

She received a well-rounded education that included the [[fine art]]s, and her apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art. As a young woman, Anguissola traveled to [[Rome]] where she was introduced to [[Michelangelo]], who immediately recognized her talent, and to [[Milan]], where she painted the [[Duke of Alba]]. The Spanish queen, [[Elizabeth of Valois]], was a keen amateur painter and in 1559 Anguissola was recruited to go to [[Madrid]] as her tutor, with the rank of [[lady-in-waiting]]. She later became an official court painter to the king, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and adapted her style to the more formal requirements of official portraits for the Spanish court. After the queen's death, Philip helped arrange an aristocratic marriage for her. She moved to [[Sicily]], and later [[Pisa]] and [[Genoa]], where she continued to practice as a leading [[portrait painter]].\n\nHer most distinctive and attractive [[paintings]] are her portraits of herself and her family, which she painted before she moved to the Spanish court. In particular, her depictions of children were fresh and closely observed.  At the Spanish court she painted formal state portraits in the prevailing official style, as one of the first, and most successful, of the relatively few female [[court painter]]s.  Later in her life she also painted religious subjects, although many of her [[Christian art|religious paintings]] have been lost. In 1625, she died at age 93 in [[Palermo]].\n\nAnguissola's example, as much as her oeuvre, had a lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists, and her great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists. Her paintings can be seen at galleries in [[Boston]] ([[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]]); [[Milwaukee]] ([[Milwaukee Art Museum]]); [[Bergamo]]; [[Brescia]]; [[Budapest]]; [[Madrid]] ([[Museo del Prado]]); [[Naples]]; [[Siena]]; and at the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]].\n\nHer contemporary [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote that Anguissola \"has shown greater application and better grace than any other woman of our age in her endeavors at [[drawing]]; she has thus succeeded not only in drawing, coloring and painting from nature, and copying excellently from others, but by herself has created rare and very beautiful paintings.\"<ref name=\"Vasari-36\">Vasari. p. 36</ref>  \n\n==Family==\n[[Image:Sofonisba Anguissola, Portr\u00e6tgruppe med kunstnerens fader Amilcare Anguissola og hendes s\u00f8skende Minerva og Astrubale, ca. 1559, 0001NMK, Nivaagaards Malerisamling.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Portrait of the Artist's Family|Family Portrait, Minerva, Amilcare and Asdrubale Anguissola]]'', c.1559]]\n\nThe origin and the name of the noble [[:it:Anguissola|<u>it:Anguissola</u>]] family are linked to an ancient Byzantine tradition, rich in historical details.<ref name=\"servizi.ct2.it\">{{Cite web | url=https://servizi.ct2.it/ssl/wiki/index.php?title=Anguissola | title=Anguissola \u2013 EFL \u2013 Societ\u00e0 Storica Lombarda}}</ref>\n\nAccording to this tradition, the Anguissolas are descended from the Constantinopolitan warlord Galvano Sordo or Galvano de Soardi/Sourdi (\u03a3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b4\u03b7, a family name still in use today in Greece, Constantinople and Smyrne).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gamberini|first=Cecilia|title=\"Sofonisba Anguissola at the Court of Philip II\" in Women artists in Early Modern Italy, ed by Sheila Barker, Brepols 2016|url=https://www.academia.edu/10375100|journal=\"Sofonisba Anguissola at the Court of Philip II\" in Women Artists in Early Modern Italy, ed by Sheila Barkes, Brepols 2016|language=en}}</ref> In 717, Galvano served in the army of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian]], and \"with an ingenious artificial fire, contributed to [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|liberate the city of Constantinople]] from the Saracens who had kept it besieged by land and sea\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_diNLAAAAYAAJ |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_diNLAAAAYAAJ/page/n537 32] |title=Repertorio genealogico delle famiglie confermate nobili e dei titolati nobili esistenti nelle provincie venete...|last=Schroeder|first=Franz|date=1830|publisher=Alvisopoli|language=it}}</ref> This \u201cartificial fire\u201d was the so-called [[Greek fire]], an incendiary weapon developed in the late 7th century, which was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of Constantinople from two [[Siege of Constantinople (674\u2013678)|Arab sieges]], thus securing the Empire's survival.\n[[File:Sofonisba Anguissola - Self-Portrait - c. 1556.jpg|alt=|thumb|213x213px|[https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/self-portrait-33656 Miniature self portrait, 1556.

Her training was not to help her into a profession where she would compete for commissions with male artists, but to make her a better wife, companion, and mother.<ref>Sylvia Ferino-Pagden and Maria Kusche, Sofonisba Anguissola: A Renaissance Woman, (Washington D.C.: The National Museum of Women in the Arts, 1995).</ref> Although Anguissola enjoyed significantly more encouragement and support than the average woman of her day, her social class did not allow her to transcend the constraints of her sex. Without the possibility of studying anatomy or drawing from life (it was considered unacceptable for a lady to view nudes), she could not undertake the complex multi-figure compositions required for large-scale religious or [[history painting]]s.\n\nInstead, she experimented with new styles of portraiture, setting subjects informally. Self-portraits and family members were her most frequent subjects, as seen in such paintings as ''Self-Portrait'' (1554, Kunsthistorisches Museum, [[Vienna]]), ''Portrait of Amilcare, Minerva and Asdrubale Anguissola'' (c. 1557\u20131558, Nivaagaards Malerisambling, Niva, Denmark), and her most famous picture, ''The Chess Game'' (1555, Muzeum Narodowe, Pozna\u0144), which depicted her sisters Lucia, Minerva and Europa. Painted when Sofonisba was 23 years old, ''The Chess Game'' is an intimate representation of an everyday family scene, combining elaborate formal clothing with very informal facial expressions, which was unusual for Italian art at this time. ''The Chess Game'' explored a new kind of genre painting which places her sitters in a domestic setting instead of the formal or allegorical settings that were popular at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Old mistresses : women, art, and ideology|last=Rozsika|first=Parker|others=Pollock, Griselda|isbn=0710008791|location=London|oclc=8160325|date = 29 October 1981}}</ref> This painting has been regarded as a [[conversation piece]], which is an informal portrait of a group engaging in lively conversation or some activity .\n\nAnguissola's self-portraits also offer evidence of what she thought her place was as a woman artist. Normally, men were seen as creative actors and women as passive objects, but in her self-portrait of 1556, Anguissola presents herself as the artist, separating herself from the role as the object to be painted.<ref>Mary Garrard, \"Here's Looking at Me: Sofonisba Anguissola and the Problem of the Woman Artist,\" Renaissance Quarterly 47, no. 3:(1994): 556.</ref> Additional pieces show how she rebels against the notion that women are objects, in essence an instrument to be played by men.

Anguissola soon gained Elisabeth's admiration and confidence and spent the following years painting many official portraits for the court, including Philip II\u2019s sister, [[Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Joanna]], and his son, [[Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Don Carlos]].\n\nThese types of paintings were far more demanding than the informal portraits upon which Anguissola had based her early reputation, as it took a tremendous amount of time and energy to render the many intricate designs of the fine fabrics and elaborate jewelry associated with royal subjects. Yet despite the challenge, Anguissola's paintings of Elisabeth of Valois \u2013 and later of [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)|Anne of Austria]], Philip II\u2019s fourth wife \u2013 were vibrant and full of life.\n[[Image:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|271x271px|The Prado Philip&nbsp;II, now recognised as by Anguissola|alt=]]\n\nDuring her 14-year residence, she guided the artistic development of Queen Elisabeth, and influenced the art made by her two daughters, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] and [[Catherine Michelle]]. Anguissola painted a portrait of the King's sister, [[Margaret of Parma]], for [[Pope Pius IV]] in 1561 and, after Queen Elisabeth 's death in childbirth in 1568, painted the likeness of Anne of Austria, Philip's fourth wife.

With the gifts and a dowry of 12,000 scudi she earned along with her salary as court painter and lady-in-waiting to the queen, she amassed an admirable return from her craft.\n[[File:Elizabeth.of.Valois.JPG|thumb|Elizabeth of Valois (Attr. Sofonisba Anguissola, 1561\u20131565). El Prado, Madrid, Spain]]\n\nWhile in the service of Elizabeth of Valois, Anguissola worked closely with [[Alonso Sanchez Coello]]. So closely in fact, that the famous painting of the middle-aged King Philip II was long attributed to Coello or [[Juan Pantoja de la Cruz]]. Only recently has Anguissola been recognized as the painting's creator.<ref>''Museo del Prado, Cat\u00e1logo de las pinturas'', 1996, p. 7, Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Cultura, Madrid, {{ISBN|84-87317-53-7}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Sofonisba 1560.jpg|alt=.|thumb|Self-portrait, 1560 circa]]\nAfter the death of [[Elisabeth of Valois]] in 1568, Philip II took a special interest in Anguissola's future. He had wished to marry her to one of the nobles in the Spanish Court. In 1571, when she was approaching the age of 40, Anguissola entered an arranged marriage to a Sicilian nobleman chosen for her by the Spanish court.<ref name=\":1\" /> Philip II paid a dowry of 12,000 scudi for her marriage to [[:it:Fabrizio Moncada|Fabrizio Moncada Pignatelli]], son of the Prince of Patern\u00f2, Viceroy of [[Sicily]]. Fabrizio was said to be supportive of her painting. Anguissola and her husband left Spain with the king's permission, and are believed to have lived in Patern\u00f2 (near Catania) from 1573 to 1579, though some recent scholarship has suggested that the couple remained in Spain.<ref name=\":0\" /> She received a royal pension of 100 ducats that enabled her to continue working and tutoring would-be painters. Her private fortune also supported her family and brother Asdrubale following Amilcare Anguissola's financial decline and death. In Patern\u00f2 she painted and donated \"La Madonna dell'Itria\".\n\nAnguissola's husband died in 1579 under mysterious circumstances.<ref name=\":1\" /> Two years later, while traveling to Cremona by sea, she fell in love with the ship's captain, sea merchant Orazio Lomellino.<ref name=\":0\" /> Against the wishes of her brother, they married in Pisa on 24 December 1584<ref name=\"Tanzi_Oxford\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> and lived in Genoa until 1620. She had no children, but maintained cordial relationships with her nieces and her stepson, Giulio.\n\n==Later years==\nLomellino's fortune, plus a generous pension from Philip II, allowed Anguissola to paint freely and live comfortably. By now quite famous, Anguissola received many colleagues who came to visit and discuss the arts with her. Several of these were younger artists, eager to learn and mimic Anguissola's distinctive style.\n\nIn her later life, Anguissola painted not only portraits but religious themes, as she had done in the days of her youth, although many of the latter have been lost. She was the leading portrait painter in Genoa until she moved to [[Palermo]] in her last years. In 1620 she painted her last self-portrait.\n[[Image:Sofonisba-Anguissola-by-Van-Dyck.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony van Dyck]], portrait of Sofonisba in 1624, when she was 92 and, according to Van Dyck's notes, mentally still very sharp.]]\nOn 12 July 1624, Anguissola was visited by the young Flemish painter [[Anthony van Dyck]], who recorded sketches from his visit to her in his sketchbook.<ref>Jaff\u00e9, Michael. \"Dyck, Anthony van.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Seven years later, on the anniversary of what would have been her 100th birthday, her husband placed an inscription on her tomb that read in part:\n\n{{Quote|1=To Sofonisba, my wife, who is recorded among the illustrious women of the world, outstanding in portraying the images of man.

Private collection.]]\n\n==Style==\n{{Main|List of paintings by Sofonisba Anguissola}}\n[[Image:Self portrait, 1610.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Sofonisba Anguissola, Self-Portrait, 1610|alt=]]\nThe influence of Campi, whose reputation was based on portraiture, is evident in Anguissola's early works, such as the ''Self-Portrait'' ([[Florence]], [[Uffizi]]). Her work was akin to the worldly tradition of Cremona, influenced greatly by the art of Parma and Mantua, in which even religious works were imbued with extreme delicacy and charm. From Gatti she seems to have absorbed elements reminiscent of [[Correggio]], beginning a trend in Cremonese painting of the late 16th century. This new direction is reflected in ''Lucia, Minerva and Europa Anguissola Playing Chess'' (1555; Pozna\u0144, N. Mus.) in which portraiture merges into a quasi-[[genre works|genre]] scene, a characteristic derived from Brescian models.\n\nThe main body of Anguissola's earlier work consists of self-portraits (the many \"autoritratti\" reflect the fact that portraits of her were frequently requested due to her fame) and portraits of her family, which are considered by many to be her finest works.\n\nApproximately fifty works have been attributed to Anguissola.  Her paintings can be seen at galleries in Baltimore ([[Walters Art Museum]]), Bergamo, Berlin ([[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]]), Graz ([[Universalmuseum Joanneum#Alte Galerie|Joanneum Alte Galerie]]), Madrid ([[Museo del Prado]]), Milan ([[Pinacoteca di Brera]]), Milwaukee ([[Milwaukee Art Museum]]), Naples ([[National Museum of Capodimonte]]), Pozna\u0144 ([[National Museum, Pozna\u0144]]), Siena ([[Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena)|Pinacoteca Nazionale]]), Southampton (City Art Gallery), and Vienna ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]).\n\n==Historical significance==\nSofonisba Anguissola's oeuvre had a lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists. Her portrait of Queen Elisabeth of Valois with a [[zibellino]] (the pelt of a marten set with a head and feet of jewelled gold) was widely copied by many of the finest artists of the time, such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]], while [[Caravaggio]] allegedly took inspiration from Anguissola's work for his ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnguissola is significant to feminist art historians. Although there has never been a period in Western history in which women were completely absent in the visual arts, Anguissola's great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists; [[Lavinia Fontana]] expressed in a letter written in 1579 that she and another woman, [[Irene di Spilimbergo]], had \u201cset [their] heart[s] on learning how to paint\u201d after seeing one of Anguissola\u2019s portraits.<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Frederika H.|title=Woman's Capacity to Create: The Unusual Case of Sofonisba Anguissola|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=1994|volume=47|issue=1|pages=74\u2013101|jstor=2863112|doi=10.2307/2863112}}</ref> Some of her more well-known successors include [[Lavinia Fontana]], [[Barbara Longhi]], [[Fede Galizia]] and [[Artemisia Gentileschi]].\n\nA Cremonese school bears the name Liceo Statale Sofonisba Anguissola.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biography.yourdictionary.com/sofonisba-anguissola|title=Sofonisba Anguissola Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n==Crater==\nOn 4 August 2017 a crater on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was named after her.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15621?__fsk=1618881824 | title=Planetary Names: Crater, craters: Anguissola on Mercury}}</ref>\n\n== Recent exhibits ==\n\n* 2019-2020: Anguissola, along with [[Lavinia Fontana]], were the focus of a major exhibit entitled \u201cA Tale of Two Women Painters\u201d at the Museo del [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], Madrid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/whats-on/exhibition/a-tale-of-two-women-painters-sofonisba-anguissola/5f6c56c8-e81a-bf38-5f3f-9a2c2f5c60eb|title=Prado, exhibit site|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Sophonisba Angussola |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=47 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Sophonisba Angussola |volume=2 |ref={{harvid|EB|1911}} |page=44}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Whitney|title=Women, Art, and Society|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|pages=|year=1990|isbn=978-0-500-20354-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/womenartsociety3edchad}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Ferino-Pagden|first=Sylvia|last2=Kusche|first2=Maria|title=Sofonisba Anguissola: A Renaissance Woman|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts|year=1995|isbn=978-0-940979-31-4|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Harris|first=Ann Sutherland|last2=Nochlin|first2=Linda|title=Women Artists: 1550\u20131950|publisher=Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Knopf|location=New York|pages=|year=1976|isbn=978-0-394-41169-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/womenartists155000harr}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Perlingieri|first=Ilya Sandra|title=Sofonisba Anguissola: The First Great Woman Artist of the Renaissance|publisher=Rizzoli International|year=1992|isbn=978-0-8478-1544-9|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Pizzagalli|first=Daniela|title=La signora della pittura: vita di Sofonisba Anguissola, gentildonna e artista nel Rinascimento|pages=|language=Italian|trans-title=The Lady of the Painting: The Life of Sofonisba Anguissola, Gentlewoman and Artist of the Renaissance|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milan|year=2003|isbn=978-88-17-99509-2}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Boullosa |first=Carmen |title=La virgen y el viol\u00edn |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Virgin and the Violin |publisher=Madrid: Editorial Siruela; Mexico: Debolsillo, Random House Mondadori}} (a novel on Sofonisba Anguissola's life)\n* Fredrika Jacobs, \"Woman's capacity to create: The unusual case of Sofonisba Anguissola\", ''ibid.'', pp.&nbsp;74\u2013101\n* ''Sofonisba Anguissola: A Renaissance Woman,'' exh. cat., National Museum of Women in Arts, Washington, DC, 1995\n* Charles de Tolnay, \"Sofonisba Anguissola and her relations with Michelango\", ''Journal of the Walters Art Gallery,'' iv, 1941, pp.&nbsp;115\u201319\n* Flavio Caroli, ''Sofonisba Anguissola e le sue sorelle,'' Milan: Mondadori, 1987\n* Mary Garrard, \"Here's looking at me: Sofonisba Anguissola and the problem of the woman artist\", ''Renaissance Quarterly, xlvii,'' 1994, pp.&nbsp;556\u2013622\n* Francesco Giordano, ''Sofonisba Anguissola: una vita per la pittura'', I Paternesi de La Sicilia, Catania 29 giugno 2006\n* Francesco Giordano, ''Sofonisba Anguissola a Patern\u00f2'', Ricerche-C.R.E.S.
