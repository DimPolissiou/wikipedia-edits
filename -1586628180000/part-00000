The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice. Prine died on April 7, 2020, of complications resulting from [[COVID-19]].\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice. Prine died on April 7, 2020, of complications resulting from [[COVID-19]].\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

As a player, Mancini operated as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|deep-lying forward]], and was best known for his time at [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], where he played more than 550 matches, and helped the team win the [[Serie A]] league title, four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He was capped 36 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], taking part at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he won a further ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'', as well as the Cup Winners' Cup, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and two more Coppa Italia titles.\n\nAs a player, Mancini would often give team talks at [[half-time]].

He won a Coppa Italia there, but left with the team facing bankruptcy. Months later he took over as manager at Lazio, where again he inherited financial constraints and was forced to lose a number of key players. With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia.\n\nIn 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter. During his first tenure at Inter, the club won three consecutive Serie A titles, an Inter club record, and an [[Football records in Italy#Most consecutive wins|Italian record 17 consecutive league game victories]] stretching nearly half a season; Mancini became Inter's most successful manager in 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/03/01/1860120.htm |title=Inter's winning run ends in draw with Udinese |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Football managers who never get the job \u2013 Mancini was Inter Milan's most successful manager in 30 years | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/shortlisted-football-managers-who-never-get-the-job-1821650.html?action=Popup&ino=8 | publisher=Independent Online | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rice | date=16 November 2009}}</ref> Despite his domestic success, many pundits saw the repeated failure to win the coveted [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] as the main reason for his dismissal in 2008.\n\nAfter being out of football for over a year, Mancini was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager in December 2009.<ref name=\"tactics\">{{cite news |title=Younger the better for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/english-football/younger-the-better-for-manchester-city-manager-roberto-mancini-1.1045178 |publisher=heraldscotland.com |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> Under his stewardship, he instilled a winning culture at the club, taking Manchester City from a mid-table club to the top level of English football, combining defensive solidity with attacking flair.

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], Mancini won his second [[List of Italian football champions|''Scudetto'']] and [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup titles]], as well as two more [[Coppa Italia]]s. In the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|1999\u201300 season]], Lazio won the ''Scudetto'' and [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but Mancini failed to score in 20 matches and later announced his playing retirement. He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training. Sometimes I would have to tell him: 'Mancio, you have a game to play on Sunday, you will be exhausted if you have to control everything.' But he was like that.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/sven-goran-eriksson-i-liked-city-theyll-win-the-league-ndash-absolutely-2178992.html Sven Goran Eriksson: 'I liked city. they'll win the league \u2013 absolutely' \u2013 News & Comment \u2013 Football].

Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the [[2004\u201305 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20130 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]]. Inter finished third in [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] and reached the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] only to be knocked out by city rivals [[A.C.

Inter again won the [[2005\u201306 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2006 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]]. Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter instead.

Livorno Calcio|Livorno]] and ending on 28 February 2007 after a 1\u20131 draw at home to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]. The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter won a [[2006\u201307 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter finished with a record-breaking 97 points.\n\nMancini became the third coach in [[History of Inter Milan|Inter history]] to win back-to-back league titles after [[Alfredo Foni]]; [[1952\u201353 Serie A|1952\u201353]] and [[1953\u201354 Serie A|1953\u201354]] and [[Helenio Herrera]]; [[1964\u201365 Serie A|1964\u201365]] and [[1965\u201366 Serie A|1965\u201366]]). Inter also progressed to the [[2006\u201307 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2007 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]] for the third consecutive season, but were beaten in both finals by [[A.S.

In Mancini's first full season in charge at City, they conceded 33 goals in the Premier League, the fewest along with Chelsea and 18 clean sheets, the highest in the [[2010\u201311 Premier League|2010\u201311 Premier League season]].\n\nMancini's training methods have been criticised by some City players<ref>{{cite news |title=Carlos Tevez criticizes Roberto Mancini's training methods |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/13/carlos-tevez-criticises-roberto-mancini |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> and especially by ex-Manchester City fitness coach [[Raymond Verheijen]], who is a personal fitness coach for [[Craig Bellamy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-coach attacks Roberto Mancini's 'crazy' training at Manchester City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/23/roberto-mancini-training-methods-manchester-city |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> During his time at City, Mancini tried to stamp his authority with rebellious players who were not performing well and has stated, \"If a top player is not happy then it's better to go.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini tells Carlos Tevez to shape up or ship out of City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/29/roberto-mancini-carlos-tevez-city-manchester |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref>\n\nMancini is known to use the media to alleviate the pressure from his players.

As a player, Mancini operated as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|deep-lying forward]], and was best known for his time at [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], where he played more than 550 matches, and helped the team win the [[Serie A]] league title, four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He was capped 36 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], taking part at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he won a further ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'', as well as the Cup Winners' Cup, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and two more Coppa Italia titles.\n\nAs a player, Mancini would often give team talks at [[half-time]].

He won a Coppa Italia there, but left with the team facing bankruptcy. Months later he took over as manager at Lazio, where again he inherited financial constraints and was forced to lose a number of key players. With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia.\n\nIn 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter. During his first tenure at Inter, the club won three consecutive Serie A titles, an Inter club record, and an [[Football records in Italy#Most consecutive wins|Italian record 17 consecutive league game victories]] stretching nearly half a season; Mancini became Inter's most successful manager in 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/03/01/1860120.htm |title=Inter's winning run ends in draw with Udinese |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Football managers who never get the job \u2013 Mancini was Inter Milan's most successful manager in 30 years | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/shortlisted-football-managers-who-never-get-the-job-1821650.html?action=Popup&ino=8 | publisher=Independent Online | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rice | date=16 November 2009}}</ref> Despite his domestic success, many pundits saw the repeated failure to win the coveted [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] as the main reason for his dismissal in 2008.\n\nAfter being out of football for over a year, Mancini was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager in December 2009.<ref name=\"tactics\">{{cite news |title=Younger the better for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/english-football/younger-the-better-for-manchester-city-manager-roberto-mancini-1.1045178 |publisher=heraldscotland.com |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> Under his stewardship, he instilled a winning culture at the club, taking Manchester City from a mid-table club to the top level of English football, combining defensive solidity with attacking flair.

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S.

In the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|1999\u201300 season]], Lazio won the ''Scudetto'' and [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but Mancini failed to score in 20 matches and later announced his playing retirement. He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training.

Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the [[2004\u201305 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20130 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]].

Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter instead.

The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter won a [[2006\u201307 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season.
