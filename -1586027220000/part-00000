The game is based on previous [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] that were created by Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' was first released for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[early access]] beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released by [[Microsoft Studios]] for the [[Xbox One]] via its [[Xbox Game Preview]] program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. A [[free-to-play]] mobile version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the [[PlayStation 4]]. ''Battlegrounds'' is one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling]] and [[List of most-played video games|most-played video games]] of all time. {{As of|2019|12}}, the PC and console versions of the game have sold over 60{{nbsp}}million units, in addition to ''PUBG Mobile'' having crossed 600{{nbsp}}million downloads.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was attributed to popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese [[video game clone|clones]] also being produced following its success. The game also received several [[Game of the Year]] nominations, among other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular [[esport]]. The game has also been banned in some countries for allegedly being harmful and addictive to young players.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Battlegrounds'' is a [[player versus player]] [[shooter game]] in which up to one hundred players fight in a [[battle royale game|battle royale]], a type of large-scale [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing deathmatch]] where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.<ref name=\"polygon guide\" />\n\nEach match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately {{convert|8|xx|8|km|mi}}, {{convert|6|xx|6|km|mi}}, and {{convert|4|xx|4|km|mi}} in size.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Forward |first1=Jordan |title=PUBG new map \u2013 all the latest details on the upcoming snow map, Vikendi |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-new-maps |website=PCGames |accessdate=March 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331152850/https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-new-maps |archive-date=March 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.<ref name=\"polygon guide\" /> Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay.

Battlegrounds''''' ('''''PUBG''''') is an online multiplayer [[battle royale game]] developed and published by [[PUBG Corporation]], a [[subsidiary]] of South Korean video game company [[Bluehole (company)|Bluehole]]. The game is based on previous [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] that were created by Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' was first released for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[early access]] beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released by [[Microsoft Studios]] for the [[Xbox One]] via its [[Xbox Game Preview]] program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. A [[free-to-play]] mobile version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the [[PlayStation 4]]. ''Battlegrounds'' is one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling]] and [[List of most-played video games|most-played video games]] of all time. {{As of|2019|12}}, the PC and console versions of the game have sold over 60{{nbsp}}million units, in addition to ''PUBG Mobile'' having crossed 600{{nbsp}}million downloads.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was attributed to popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese [[video game clone|clones]] also being produced following its success. The game also received several [[Game of the Year]] nominations, among other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular [[esport]]. The game has also been banned in some countries for allegedly being harmful and addictive to young players.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Battlegrounds'' is a [[player versus player]] [[shooter game]] in which up to one hundred players fight in a [[battle royale game|battle royale]], a type of large-scale [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing deathmatch]] where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.<ref name=\"polygon guide\" />\n\nEach match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately {{convert|8|xx|8|km|mi}}, {{convert|6|xx|6|km|mi}}, and {{convert|4|xx|4|km|mi}} in size.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Forward |first1=Jordan |title=PUBG new map \u2013 all the latest details on the upcoming snow map, Vikendi |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-new-maps |website=PCGames |accessdate=March 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331152850/https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-new-maps |archive-date=March 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.<ref name=\"polygon guide\" /> Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay.

The Gamescom 2017 event demonstrated the issues surrounding the logistics of running a large ''Battlegrounds'' tournament with a large number of players involved, and they had worked alongside ESL to explore how to do this effectively in the future. Further, Greene stated there was also the need to establish a format for presenting a ''Battlegrounds'' match to make it interesting to spectators, which he thought would take some time to develop given the nature of the emergent gameplay, comparing it to established first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arena esport games.<ref>{{Cite web
