As shows at the Delacorte begin in the early evening, shows usually start in daylight; as the play rolls on, the sun sets and the audience is drawn into the illuminated action on the stage. Since 1962 the Public has had the privilege of its exclusive use.\n\n===Ticket distribution===\n[[File:Awaiting Shakespeare CP jeh.jpg|thumb|Awaiting tickets]]\n\nTickets to Shakespeare in the Park are free and tickets for a given performance are distributed the same day by various methods:\n*Central Park distribution \u2013 Up to two tickets per person are distributed outside the Delacorte Theater. The line for tickets forms when the park opens at 6 a.m. and grows until tickets are distributed at noon. A separate line is available for senior citizens 65 and older with valid I.D. The ADA Accessible line is intended for patrons with disabilities and can be joined by checking in with staff at the box office the morning of a performance who will provide, as availability dictates, tickets in locations suited to various individual needs.\n*Downtown Lottery - A limited number of vouchers for that evening's performance are distributed through an in-person lottery at the Public Theater. Lottery entries are accepted between 11 am and 12 pm and winners are drawn while supplies last.\n*Borough distribution \u2013 A limited number of vouchers for specific performances are distributed at locations throughout New York City's five boroughs on certain days during the run of a production. Each person in line is allowed two vouchers and each voucher is good for one ticket for that evening\u2019s performance. Vouchers must be exchanged for tickets at the Delacorte Theater box office that same day from 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Tickets cannot be exchanged in the event the performance is rained-out which is a possibility. A performance will never be cancelled before the scheduled start time and may continue in the rain if it is deemed safe by the production staff. Late seating is at the discretion of management and may not be granted until 30\u201340 minutes into the show.<ref>http://publictheater.org/Programs--Events/Shakespeare-in-the-Park/Free-Ticket-Distribution-in-the-Park/</ref>\n*TodayTix \u2013 In 2015, the Public introduced its partnership with the app TodayTix.<ref>http://www.todaytix.com/us/nyc/lottery/shakespeare-in-the-park/</ref> App users can log on and apply for the virtual lottery for that day's show. Winners are notified between 12 pm and 2:30 pm.\n\nShakespeare in the Park also offers specific performances throughout the summer for patrons with hearing and/or vision loss including Sign Language interpreted performances, audio-described performances, and open-captioned performances.\n\n===Productions===\n\n{{main article|List of Shakespeare in the Park productions at the Delacorte Theater}}\n\nEach summer since the Delacorte's opening has seen between one and three works produced, with two works being standard since 1973. The plays of Shakespeare account for about four-fifths of the works produced, and, except for 1977 and 1980, each summer's line-up has included at least one work by Shakespeare (or, in the case of 1970, one work adapted from Shakespeare). Non-Shakespeare productions have included plays such as [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' and [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and musicals such as ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', ''[[Into the Woods]]'', ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', ''[[Drood|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', and [[Disney Theatrical Productions|Disney's]] ''[[Hercules (musical)|Hercules]]'', the latter three having made their world debuts at the Delacorte.\n\nThe 2017 production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', directed by the Public's artistic director, [[Oskar Eustis]], stoked controversy by creating significant visual and behavioral similarities between the production's [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and recently inaugurated [[President Trump]].

The festival has also attracted many well-known actors, such as [[Meryl Streep]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Al Pacino]] \u2013 the latter two of whom appeared as Brutus and Marc Antony in a toga-clad historical production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', directed by Stuart Vaughan in 1987, in the first of the NYSF's Shakespeare Marathon. Since its inception, the festival has become popular with both New York natives and visitors to the city, and while the Delacorte Theater has 1,872 seats, prospective theatergoers can expect to sit in line for hours before the early afternoon ticket distribution. Approximately 80,000 people attend Shakespeare in the Park every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc24.org/2005/centralpark/art/shakespeare.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205013448/http://www.nyc24.org/2005/centralpark/art/shakespeare.html |archivedate=December 5, 2005  }}, nyc24.org; accessed February 14, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship of other theatres==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}\nOver the years, the New York Shakespeare Festival supported other theatre companies throughout New York, helping to foster the growth of [[Off-Broadway]], as well as specific theatre programs and projects.  Among these companies that benefited from NYSF during critical periods of their development was the [[Theatre for a New Audience]]. The Theatre for a New Audience developed a number of productions sponsored by the NYSF, including ''A Midsummer Nights Dream'', presented at the Ansbacher Theatre, and through this sponsorship, the company was able to grow and expand its outreach to new audiences.  Another such company was the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]]. The Festival, under Papp's leadership, sponsored several Riverside Shakespeare Company productions at a critical stage in its development, beginning with Riverside's New York premiere production of Brecht's ''[[The Life of Edward II of England|Edward II]]'' in 1982 at [[The Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side (dedicated by Joseph Papp in 1982), followed by [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] parks tours of free Shakespeare throughout the five boroughs of New York City, much as the NYSF had done for years before. Riverside Shakespeare Company summer parks tour of Free Shakespeare sponsored by the NYSF began with ''A Comedy of Errors'' in 1982, followed by ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', featuring [[Anna Deavere Smith]] in her New York stage debut as Mistress Quickly, ''Romeo and Juliet'', and ''The Taming of the Shrew''. During the NYSF period of support, the Riverside Shakespeare Company expanded greatly, offering for the first time [[The Shakespeare Project]] in 1983, and serving a wide range of audiences in the five boroughs.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Joseph Papp]]\n* [[Hudson Warehouse]], another Shakespeare-in-the-park program\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.publictheater.org/ The Public Theater's homepage]\n*{{IBDB name|name=New York Shakespeare Festival}}\n*[http://catalog.nypl.org/record=b15059124~S1 New York Shakespeare Festival records, 1954\u20131992], Held by the Billy Rose Theatre Division, [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]\n*[http://catalog.nypl.org/record=b19277354~S1 New York Shakespeare Festival records, additions, 1968\u20132010], Held by the Billy Rose Theatre Division, [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]\n*[http://www.nypl.org/archives/2674 New York Shakespeare Festival music scores.

Since 1962 the Public has had the privilege of its exclusive use.\n\n===Ticket distribution===\n[[File:Awaiting Shakespeare CP jeh.jpg|thumb|Awaiting tickets]]\n\nTickets to Shakespeare in the Park are free and tickets for a given performance are distributed the same day by various methods:\n*Central Park distribution \u2013 Up to two tickets per person are distributed outside the Delacorte Theater. The line for tickets forms when the park opens at 6 a.m. and grows until tickets are distributed at noon. A separate line is available for senior citizens 65 and older with valid I.D. The ADA Accessible line is intended for patrons with disabilities and can be joined by checking in with staff at the box office the morning of a performance who will provide, as availability dictates, tickets in locations suited to various individual needs.\n*Downtown Lottery - A limited number of vouchers for that evening's performance are distributed through an in-person lottery at the Public Theater. Lottery entries are accepted between 11 am and 12 pm and winners are drawn while supplies last.\n*Borough distribution \u2013 A limited number of vouchers for specific performances are distributed at locations throughout New York City's five boroughs on certain days during the run of a production. Each person in line is allowed two vouchers and each voucher is good for one ticket for that evening\u2019s performance. Vouchers must be exchanged for tickets at the Delacorte Theater box office that same day from 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Tickets cannot be exchanged in the event the performance is rained-out which is a possibility. A performance will never be cancelled before the scheduled start time and may continue in the rain if it is deemed safe by the production staff. Late seating is at the discretion of management and may not be granted until 30\u201340 minutes into the show.<ref>http://publictheater.org/Programs--Events/Shakespeare-in-the-Park/Free-Ticket-Distribution-in-the-Park/</ref>\n*TodayTix \u2013 In 2015, the Public introduced its partnership with the app TodayTix.<ref>http://www.todaytix.com/us/nyc/lottery/shakespeare-in-the-park/</ref> App users can log on and apply for the virtual lottery for that day's show. Winners are notified between 12 pm and 2:30 pm.\n\nShakespeare in the Park also offers specific performances throughout the summer for patrons with hearing and/or vision loss including Sign Language interpreted performances, audio-described performances, and open-captioned performances.\n\n===Productions===\n\n{{main article|List of Shakespeare in the Park productions at the Delacorte Theater}}\n\nEach summer since the Delacorte's opening has seen between one and three works produced, with two works being standard since 1973. The plays of Shakespeare account for about four-fifths of the works produced, and, except for 1977 and 1980, each summer's line-up has included at least one work by Shakespeare (or, in the case of 1970, one work adapted from Shakespeare). Non-Shakespeare productions have included plays such as [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' and [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and musicals such as ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', ''[[Into the Woods]]'', ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', ''[[Drood|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', and [[Disney Theatrical Productions|Disney's]] ''[[Hercules (musical)|Hercules]]'', the latter three having made their world debuts at the Delacorte.\n\nThe 2017 production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', directed by the Public's artistic director, [[Oskar Eustis]], stoked controversy by creating significant visual and behavioral similarities between the production's [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and recently inaugurated [[President Trump]].

The festival has also attracted many well-known actors, such as [[Meryl Streep]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Al Pacino]] \u2013 the latter two of whom appeared as Brutus and Marc Antony in a toga-clad historical production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', directed by Stuart Vaughan in 1987, in the first of the NYSF's Shakespeare Marathon. Since its inception, the festival has become popular with both New York natives and visitors to the city, and while the Delacorte Theater has 1,872 seats, prospective theatergoers can expect to sit in line for hours before the early afternoon ticket distribution. Approximately 80,000 people attend Shakespeare in the Park every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc24.org/2005/centralpark/art/shakespeare.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205013448/http://www.nyc24.org/2005/centralpark/art/shakespeare.html |archivedate=December 5, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}, nyc24.org; accessed February 14, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship of other theatres==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}\nOver the years, the New York Shakespeare Festival supported other theatre companies throughout New York, helping to foster the growth of [[Off-Broadway]], as well as specific theatre programs and projects.  Among these companies that benefited from NYSF during critical periods of their development was the [[Theatre for a New Audience]]. The Theatre for a New Audience developed a number of productions sponsored by the NYSF, including ''A Midsummer Nights Dream'', presented at the Ansbacher Theatre, and through this sponsorship, the company was able to grow and expand its outreach to new audiences.  Another such company was the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]]. The Festival, under Papp's leadership, sponsored several Riverside Shakespeare Company productions at a critical stage in its development, beginning with Riverside's New York premiere production of Brecht's ''[[The Life of Edward II of England|Edward II]]'' in 1982 at [[The Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side (dedicated by Joseph Papp in 1982), followed by [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] parks tours of free Shakespeare throughout the five boroughs of New York City, much as the NYSF had done for years before. Riverside Shakespeare Company summer parks tour of Free Shakespeare sponsored by the NYSF began with ''A Comedy of Errors'' in 1982, followed by ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', featuring [[Anna Deavere Smith]] in her New York stage debut as Mistress Quickly, ''Romeo and Juliet'', and ''The Taming of the Shrew''. During the NYSF period of support, the Riverside Shakespeare Company expanded greatly, offering for the first time [[The Shakespeare Project]] in 1983, and serving a wide range of audiences in the five boroughs.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Joseph Papp]]\n* [[Hudson Warehouse]], another Shakespeare-in-the-park program\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.publictheater.org/ The Public Theater's homepage]\n*{{IBDB name|name=New York Shakespeare Festival}}\n*[http://catalog.nypl.org/record=b15059124~S1 New York Shakespeare Festival records, 1954\u20131992], Held by the Billy Rose Theatre Division, [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]\n*[http://catalog.nypl.org/record=b19277354~S1 New York Shakespeare Festival records, additions, 1968\u20132010], Held by the Billy Rose Theatre Division, [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]\n*[http://www.nypl.org/archives/2674 New York Shakespeare Festival music scores.

More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility.

Throughout history, various peoples have known the importance of eating certain foods to prevent the outbreak of symptoms now associated with malnutrition. Yet such knowledge appears to have been repeatedly lost and then re-discovered. For example, the symptoms of [[scurvy]] were reportedly known to the ancient Egyptians. Anti-scurvy measures were sometimes undertook by 14th century [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who would ensure that citrus fruits were planted on Mediterranean islands, for use on sea journeys. Knowledge of the importance of such measures appears to have been forgotten by Europeans for several centuries, to be rediscovered in the 18th century.In the early 19th century the British navy ensured their ship's crews were given frequent rations of lemon juice, massively reducing deaths from scurvy and giving the British a significant advantage in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Later in the 19th century, the British navy replaced lemons with limes, not aware at the time that limes were much less effective than lemons at preventing scurvy.<ref name=\"Ruxin\">{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317860/1/288630.pdf|title=Hunger, Science, and Politics: FAO, WHO, and Unicef Nutrition Policies, 1945-1978|publisher= [[University College London]]|date=1996|author=Joshua Ruxin|accessdate=January 12, 2019|author-link=Josh Ruxin}}</ref><ref name = \"HungerModHist\">{{cite book|author= James Vernon|title= Hunger: A Modern History|pages= [https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81 81\u2013140, ''passim'']|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-674-02678-0|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Michael Worboys, it was between the wars that malnutrition was essentially discovered, and the science of nutrition established. This built on work such as [[Casimir Funk]]'s 1912 formulisation of the concept of vitamins. There was increased scientific study of malnutrition in the 1920s and 1930s, and this became even more pronounced after world war 2. Charities and United Nations agencies would devote considerable energy to alleviating malnutrition around the world. The exact methods and priorities for doing this tended to fluctuate over the years, with varying levels of focus on different types of malnutrition like [[Kwashiorkor]] or [[Marasmus]]; varying levels of concern on protein deficiency compared to vitamins, minerals and lack of raw calories; and varying priorities given to the problem of malnutrition in general compared to other health and development concerns. The [[green Revolution]] of the 1950s and 1960s saw considerable improvement in capability to prevent malnutrition.<ref name = \"HungerModHist\"/><ref name=\"Ruxin\"/><ref name=\"Grigg\">{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945\u20131980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981|volume= 6| issue = 3|series= NS|pages=279\u2013292|quote= Before 1945 very little academic or political notice was taken of the problem of world hunger, since 1945 there has been a vast literature on the subject.|doi = 10.2307/622288 |jstor=622288}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first official global documents addressing Food security and global malnutrition was the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR).

More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility.

Throughout history, various peoples have known the importance of eating certain foods to prevent the outbreak of symptoms now associated with malnutrition. Yet such knowledge appears to have been repeatedly lost and then re-discovered. For example, the symptoms of [[scurvy]] were reportedly known to the ancient Egyptians. Anti-scurvy measures were sometimes undertook by 14th century [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who would ensure that citrus fruits were planted on Mediterranean islands, for use on sea journeys. Knowledge of the importance of such measures appears to have been forgotten by Europeans for several centuries, to be rediscovered in the 18th century.In the early 19th century the British navy ensured their ship's crews were given frequent rations of lemon juice, massively reducing deaths from scurvy and giving the British a significant advantage in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Later in the 19th century, the British navy replaced lemons with limes, not aware at the time that limes were much less effective than lemons at preventing scurvy.<ref name=\"Ruxin\">{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317860/1/288630.pdf|title=Hunger, Science, and Politics: FAO, WHO, and Unicef Nutrition Policies, 1945-1978|publisher= [[University College London]]|date=1996|author=Joshua Ruxin|accessdate=January 12, 2019|author-link=Josh Ruxin}}</ref><ref name = \"HungerModHist\">{{cite book|author= James Vernon|title= Hunger: A Modern History|pages= [https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81 81\u2013140, ''passim'']|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-674-02678-0|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0/page/81}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Michael Worboys, it was between the wars that malnutrition was essentially discovered, and the science of nutrition established. This built on work such as [[Casimir Funk]]'s 1912 formulisation of the concept of vitamins. There was increased scientific study of malnutrition in the 1920s and 1930s, and this became even more pronounced after world war 2. Charities and United Nations agencies would devote considerable energy to alleviating malnutrition around the world. The exact methods and priorities for doing this tended to fluctuate over the years, with varying levels of focus on different types of malnutrition like [[Kwashiorkor]] or [[Marasmus]]; varying levels of concern on protein deficiency compared to vitamins, minerals and lack of raw calories; and varying priorities given to the problem of malnutrition in general compared to other health and development concerns. The [[green Revolution]] of the 1950s and 1960s saw considerable improvement in capability to prevent malnutrition.<ref name = \"HungerModHist\"/><ref name=\"Ruxin\"/><ref name=\"Grigg\">{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945\u20131980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981|volume= 6| issue = 3|series= NS|pages=279\u2013292|quote= Before 1945 very little academic or political notice was taken of the problem of world hunger, since 1945 there has been a vast literature on the subject.|doi = 10.2307/622288 |jstor=622288}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first official global documents addressing Food security and global malnutrition was the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR).
