Both firms had become key manufacturers of emergency escape parachutes by the end of the 1930s, selling their products to many air forces throughout the globe. The rival firms cooperated during the [[World War II|Second World War]], developing safer and increasingly reliable parachute assemblies for aircrews and airborne forces; their parachutes were extensively used throughout the conflict. In the [[postwar]] period, both companies continued to advance their products into new fields, including their incorporation into [[ejector seat]]s, the recovery of space vehicles, [[Drogue parachute|brake parachute]], and the aerial delivery of very large payloads.\n\nThe Irvin Airchute Company was ultimately acquired by its long-time collaborator GQ Parachutes. During 2001, the merged entity was named ''IRVIN-GQ''. Having changed ownership multiple times over the years, the company is presently a subsidiary of aerospace conglomerate [[TransDigm Group]]. Since 2003, IRVIN-GQ has based its main UK manufacturing site in [[Llangeinor]], [[Wales]].\n\n==History==\nIRVIN-GQ has its origins in the ''Irvin Airchute Company'', which was established during 1919 in [[Buffalo, New York]] by the parachutist [[Leslie Irvin (parachutist)|Leslie Irvin]], who had performed the world's first free-fall parachute jump earlier that same year.<ref name=\"airsys history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.airborne-sys.com/milestones.htm |title=Milestones |accessdate=21 November 2010 |publisher=Airborne Systems |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027034506/http://www.airborne-sys.com/milestones.htm |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=bbc1202>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2546409.stm |title=Parachute firm in job expansion |accessdate=20 November 2010 |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2002}}</ref> During 1925, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) placed an order with the Irvin Airchute Company to supply parachutes for its aircrews.<ref name=\"airsys history\"/> To fulfil this and future European orders, the firm established a factory in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1926.<ref name=\"irvin history\"/>\n\nDuring 1932, James Gregory and Raymond Quilter founded another pioneering parachute manufacturer, ''GQ Parachutes''.
