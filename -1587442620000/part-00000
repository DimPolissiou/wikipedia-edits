Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978\u201379 season.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Badges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.danburymint.co.uk/index.php?act=product&product_id=4250&cat_id=&mediacode=&kiks_code=|title=The Badges of Rangers Football Club|publisher=Danbury Mint|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=The earliest badge featured the celebrated RFC scroll crest believed to have been used since 1872.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation. '1872\u20132012' appeared above the scroll crest with the words '140 years' featuring below.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Gersnet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=261&Itemid=326|title=The Rangers Crest|publisher=Gersnet Online|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=From 1990 to 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto were placed above and below the Crest respectively.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Taiwan.<ref>https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taipei-main-station-gets-facelift-at-125</ref> It is served by [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]], the [[Taiwan Railways Administration]], and the [[Taipei Metro]]. It is also connected through underground passageways to [[Taipei main station (Taoyuan Metro)|the terminal station]] of [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]] and the [[Taipei Bus Station]]. In 2017, it was the busiest station on all three rail systems, with a total of 190 million entries and exits.\n\n==Station overview==\nThe four-level station is located in the [[Zhongzheng District]] in downtown Taipei. The underground station area south of the station is known as \"station front\" because the original railway station's main entrance faced south. Accordingly, the area just north of the station is known as \"station rear.\" The station rear area is actually located in the [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong District]]. The commercial districts around the station are popular with students and commuters, and boast a large collection of bookstores, eclectic businesses targeting students, and [[cram school]]s. Because of its location at what is roughly considered the center of Taipei, the station is a popular meeting point for students and tourists.{{citation needed}}\n\n==Services==\nThe station itself is a large building which houses multiple rail services as well as serving as the headquarters of the [[Taiwan Railways Administration]]. The railway platforms are located on the B2 level, while the B1 level serves as a waiting area. Ticketing services are on the first floor while the second floor contains a food court and several stores, including the shopping center (Breeze Taipei Station).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=92084&CtNode=1337&mp=1|title=More than just a station|publisher=Taiwan Review|date=2010-02-01|accessdate=2010-02-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110635/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=92084&CtNode=1337&mp=1|archivedate=2011-07-16}}</ref> The upper levels are occupied by TRA offices.\n\n*'''[[Taiwan Railways Administration]]''': Passengers can board a train to most cities in Taiwan without transferring.

In 1901, the station was located to the east of its current location. It was rebuilt in 1940 to accommodate growing passenger traffic.\n\nTo alleviate traffic congestion caused by railroad crossings in downtown Taipei, an underground railway [[tunnel]] between Huashan and [[Wanhua District|Wanhua]] was built along with the present station building as part of the [[Taipei Railway Underground Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway.gov.tw/en/yearbook/yearbook-1.aspx|title=Taiwan Railway History|publisher=Taiwan Railways Administration|accessdate=2010-06-16}}</ref> When the underground system was completed on 2 September 1989, railway service was moved to the newly completed building (completed on 5 September 1989) and the old building as well as a temporary station were demolished.\n\nThe current station was further expanded with the opening of the [[Taipei Metro]]. The metro station is connected to the basement of the railway station and opened to passenger traffic in 1997 to the [[Tamsui\u2013Xinyi line]]. Extensive underground malls now exist at the front and back of the station,<ref>{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=Phil|title=Taiwan|publisher=National Geographic Books|year=2007|page=59|isbn=1426201451}}</ref> which emulate those found in [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. The station also became a terminus for [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]] trains when the network began service in 2007.\n\n===Ongoing developments===\nTaipei station and the area surrounding it have been undergoing renovation since 2005. Japanese architect [[Fumihiko Maki]] was chosen to design two skyscrapers that will surround the railroad station.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2005/07/20/2003264300 |title=Japanese architect wins design bid |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=2005-07-20 |accessdate=2010-06-17 |agency=Deutsche Presse-Agentur |page=11}}</ref> Maki will also oversee the renovation of Taipei station.

Taiwan.<ref>https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taipei-main-station-gets-facelift-at-125</ref> It is served by [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]], the [[Taiwan Railways Administration]], and the [[Taipei Metro]]. It is also connected through underground passageways to [[Taipei main station (Taoyuan Metro)|the terminal station]] of [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]] and the [[Taipei Bus Station]]. In 2017, it was the busiest station on all three rail systems, with a total of 190 million entries and exits.\n\n==Station overview==\nThe four-level station is located in the [[Zhongzheng District]] in downtown Taipei. The underground station area south of the station is known as \"station front\" because the original railway station's main entrance faced south. Accordingly, the area just north of the station is known as \"station rear.\" The station rear area is actually located in the [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong District]]. The commercial districts around the station are popular with students and commuters, and boast a large collection of bookstores, eclectic businesses targeting students, and [[cram school]]s. Because of its location at what is roughly considered the center of Taipei, the station is a popular meeting point for students and tourists.\n\n==Services==\nThe station itself is a large building which houses multiple rail services as well as serving as the headquarters of the [[Taiwan Railways Administration]]. The railway platforms are located on the B2 level, while the B1 level serves as a waiting area. Ticketing services are on the first floor while the second floor contains a food court and several stores, including the shopping center (Breeze Taipei Station).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=92084&CtNode=1337&mp=1|title=More than just a station|publisher=Taiwan Review|date=2010-02-01|accessdate=2010-02-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110635/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=92084&CtNode=1337&mp=1|archivedate=2011-07-16}}</ref> The upper levels are occupied by TRA offices.\n\n*'''[[Taiwan Railways Administration]]''': Passengers can board a train to most cities in Taiwan without transferring.

In 1901, the station was located to the east of its current location. It was rebuilt in 1940 to accommodate growing passenger traffic.\n\nTo alleviate traffic congestion caused by railroad crossings in downtown Taipei, an underground railway [[tunnel]] between Huashan and [[Wanhua District|Wanhua]] was built along with the present station building as part of the [[Taipei Railway Underground Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway.gov.tw/en/yearbook/yearbook-1.aspx|title=Taiwan Railway History|publisher=Taiwan Railways Administration|accessdate=2010-06-16}}</ref> When the underground system was completed on 2 September 1989, railway service was moved to the newly completed building (completed on 5 September 1989) and the old building as well as a temporary station were demolished.\n\nThe current station was further expanded with the opening of the [[Taipei Metro]]. The metro station is connected to the basement of the railway station and opened to passenger traffic in 1997 to the [[Tamsui\u2013Xinyi line]].

The series, based on the characters of [[DC Comics]], airs on [[The CW]] and is a spin-off featuring characters introduced in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' along with new characters, set in the [[Arrowverse]], the same fictional universe. It is the fourth series in the Arrowverse, after ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', and [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'']]. The series premiered in January 2016. ''Legends of Tomorrow'' has been renewed for a [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|fifth season]], which premiered in January 2020. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n{{further|List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\nThe first main character introduced in the series is [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]], a member of the Time Masters, an organization tasked with protecting the timeline. Hunter goes rogue after [[Vandal Savage (Arrowverse)|Vandal Savage]] murders his family early in the series. Intending to stop Savage, Hunter recruits a team consisting of characters previously introduced in other CW programs including [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer / Atom]], [[Sara Lance|Sara Lance / White Canary]], [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein]] and [[Jefferson Jackson (Arrowverse)|Jefferson \"Jax\" Jackson]] / Firestorm, [[Kendra Saunders (Arrowverse)|Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl]], [[Carter Hall (Arrowverse)|Carter Hall / Hawkman]], [[Leonard Snart (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart / Captain Cold]], and [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory / Heat Wave]]. Season one's primary storyline involves the team discovering that the Time Masters were backing Savage. The team destroys that organization, though they lose Snart and Rip in the process.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|season two]], with the Time Masters defeated, the team guard the timeline themselves, all while coping with Rip's disappearance. However, this season introduces the [[Legion of Doom]], a time-travelling team led by [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne)]]. He's shown to have recruited versions of [[Damien Darhk (Arrowverse)|Damien Darhk]], [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], and Leonard Snart to find the Biblical [[Spear of Destiny]], with which they can alter their fates. Season two also shows the team joined by [[Justice Society of America]] member\n[[Amaya Jiwe|Amaya Jiwe / Vixen]] and modern-day historian [[Nate Heywood (Arrowverse)|Nate Heywood / Steel]], who later acquires the power to become solid metal.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 3)|season three]], the team discovers that they created [[anachronism]]s throughout time after beating the Legion, though Rip has formed the Time Bureau to help fix them. He also tells them that [[Nora Darhk]] has resurrected her father, Damien, as well as recruited Amaya's villainous granddaughter, [[Kuasa]], and enemy of the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]] [[Gorilla Grodd]] so that they can release the demon Mallus. Though the team loses Firestorm, they're joined by [[Zari Tomaz]], a hacktivist from 2042 who wields an air-controlling amulet, and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West / Kid Flash]], a speedster who trained under the Flash. Time Bureau agent and later director [[Ava Sharpe]] also starts working closely with the team in this season, entering a relationship with Sara Lance. Upon defeating Mallus, Amaya returns home to Zambesi and Wally departs to find his own way.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 4)|season four]], [[occult detective fiction|occult detective]] [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] joins the team to help them hunt down magical fugitives that have been scattered throughout the timeline following the team's battle with Mallus. Along the way, they eventually discover that events surrounding the creatures have been orchestrated by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], who Constantine has faced before. The Legends are joined further by the shapeshifter [[Charlie (Arrowverse)|Charlie]], who becomes stuck in Amaya's physical form after losing her powers, and [[Mona Wu]], who has the ability to turn into a [[Kaupe]].\n{{:List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|List of Arrowverse cast members}}\n\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein / Firestorm]] (seasons 1\u20133): <br />A nuclear physicist focused on transmutation and also half of the superhero Firestorm with Jefferson Jackson.

Because you don't necessarily know if you are going to have a show that's been picked up, they don't want to invest a lot of money in the infrastructure, so you end up shooting more on location. The only set that was built was the Waverider. That being said, because we knew there was a pickup for the show, it wasn't a conventional pilot. All the resources of construction went into the Waverider. That's continuing into the series. I don't think they tend to build much. I think they tend to adapt locations because there's so much time travel and so many eras to create.<ref name=\"Winter\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Broadcast==\n''Legends of Tomorrow'' premiered in the United States on January 21, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cw-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-premiere-date-1201647117/ |title=CW Slots 'DC's Legends of Tomorrow' for Thursdays; 'Vampire Diaries' to Friday |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |last=Kissel |first=Rick |date=November 23, 2015 |accessdate=November 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124135435/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cw-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-premiere-date-1201647117/ |archivedate=November 24, 2015 }}</ref> and the first season consisted of sixteen episodes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow/listings/|title=Shows A-Z \u2013 dc's legends of tomorrow on the cw|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref> The series premiere in Australia was originally announced as January 20, 2016,<ref name=FoxtelUpfronts>{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |first=David |last=Knox |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/foxtel-upfronts-2016-local-thrillers-lifestyle-us-drama.html |title=Foxtel Upfronts 2016: Local thrillers, Lifestyle & US Drama. |date=November 5, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107212555/http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/foxtel-upfronts-2016-local-thrillers-lifestyle-us-drama.html |archivedate=November 7, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |first=David |last=Knox |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/airdate-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow.html |title=Airdate: DC's Legends of Tomorrow |date=November 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116141125/http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/airdate-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow.html |archivedate=November 16, 2015 }}</ref> however it was pushed back until January 22.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/New-In-January-200-shows-including-DC-s-Legends-Of-Tomorrow/ba-p/106619 |title=New In January: 200+ shows including DC's Legends Of Tomorrow, Andrew Winter's Tiny House & more |publisher=The Green Room |first=Chuck |last=Purcell |date=December 24, 2015 |accessdate=January 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103045859/http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/New-In-January-200-shows-including-DC-s-Legends-Of-Tomorrow/ba-p/106619 |archivedate=January 3, 2016 }}</ref> It started airing in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sky-takes-legends-tomorrow-uk-843856 |title=DC's 'Legends of Tomorrow' Docks With Sky in U.K. |last=Ritman |first=Alex |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 25, 2015 |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126134506/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sky-takes-legends-tomorrow-uk-843856 |archivedate=November 26, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\"\n|-\n!

The series, based on the characters of [[DC Comics]], airs on [[The CW]] and is a spin-off featuring characters introduced in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' along with new characters, set in the [[Arrowverse]], the same fictional universe. It is the fourth series in the Arrowverse, after ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', and [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'']]. The series premiered in January 2016. ''Legends of Tomorrow'' has been renewed for a [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|fifth season]], which premiered in January 2020. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n{{further|List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\nThe first main character introduced in the series is [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]], a member of the Time Masters, an organization tasked with protecting the timeline. Hunter goes rogue after [[Vandal Savage (Arrowverse)|Vandal Savage]] murders his family early in the series. Intending to stop Savage, Hunter recruits a team consisting of characters previously introduced in other CW programs including [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer / Atom]], [[Sara Lance|Sara Lance / White Canary]], [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein]] and [[Jefferson Jackson (Arrowverse)|Jefferson \"Jax\" Jackson]] / Firestorm, [[Kendra Saunders (Arrowverse)|Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl]], [[Carter Hall (Arrowverse)|Carter Hall / Hawkman]], [[Leonard Snart (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart / Captain Cold]], and [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory / Heat Wave]]. Season one's primary storyline involves the team discovering that the Time Masters were backing Savage. The team destroys that organization, though they lose Snart and Rip in the process.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|season two]], with the Time Masters defeated, the team guard the timeline themselves, all while coping with Rip's disappearance. However, this season introduces the [[Legion of Doom]], a time-travelling team led by [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne)]]. He's shown to have recruited versions of [[Damien Darhk (Arrowverse)|Damien Darhk]], [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], and Leonard Snart to find the Biblical [[Spear of Destiny]], with which they can alter their fates. Season two also shows the team joined by [[Justice Society of America]] member\n[[Amaya Jiwe|Amaya Jiwe / Vixen]] and modern-day historian [[Nate Heywood (Arrowverse)|Nate Heywood / Steel]], who later acquires the power to become solid metal.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 3)|season three]], the team discovers that they created [[anachronism]]s throughout time after beating the Legion, though Rip has formed the Time Bureau to help fix them. He also tells them that [[Nora Darhk]] has resurrected her father, Damien, as well as recruited Amaya's villainous granddaughter, [[Kuasa]], and enemy of the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]] [[Gorilla Grodd]] so that they can release the demon Mallus. Though the team loses Firestorm, they're joined by [[Zari Tomaz]], a hacktivist from 2042 who wields an air-controlling amulet, and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West / Kid Flash]], a speedster who trained under the Flash. Time Bureau agent and later director [[Ava Sharpe]] also starts working closely with the team in this season, entering a relationship with Sara Lance. Upon defeating Mallus, Amaya returns home to Zambesi and Wally departs to find his own way.\n\nIn [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 4)|season four]], [[occult detective fiction|occult detective]] [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] joins the team to help them hunt down magical fugitives that have been scattered throughout the timeline following the team's battle with Mallus. Along the way, they eventually discover that events surrounding the creatures have been orchestrated by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], who Constantine has faced before. The Legends are joined further by the shapeshifter [[Charlie (Arrowverse)|Charlie]], who becomes stuck in Amaya's physical form after losing her powers, and [[Mona Wu]], who has the ability to turn into a [[Kaupe]].\n{{:List of Legends of Tomorrow episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|List of Arrowverse cast members}}\n\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein / Firestorm]] (seasons 1\u20133): <br />A nuclear physicist focused on transmutation and also half of the superhero Firestorm with Jefferson Jackson.

Because you don't necessarily know if you are going to have a show that's been picked up, they don't want to invest a lot of money in the infrastructure, so you end up shooting more on location. The only set that was built was the Waverider. That being said, because we knew there was a pickup for the show, it wasn't a conventional pilot. All the resources of construction went into the Waverider. That's continuing into the series. I don't think they tend to build much. I think they tend to adapt locations because there's so much time travel and so many eras to create.<ref name=\"Winter\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Broadcast==\n''Legends of Tomorrow'' premiered in the United States on January 21, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cw-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-premiere-date-1201647117/ |title=CW Slots 'DC's Legends of Tomorrow' for Thursdays; 'Vampire Diaries' to Friday |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |last=Kissel |first=Rick |date=November 23, 2015 |accessdate=November 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124135435/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cw-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-premiere-date-1201647117/ |archivedate=November 24, 2015 }}</ref> and the first season consisted of sixteen episodes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow/listings/|title=Shows A-Z \u2013 dc's legends of tomorrow on the cw|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref> The series premiere in Australia was originally announced as January 20, 2016,<ref name=FoxtelUpfronts>{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |first=David |last=Knox |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/foxtel-upfronts-2016-local-thrillers-lifestyle-us-drama.html |title=Foxtel Upfronts 2016: Local thrillers, Lifestyle & US Drama. |date=November 5, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107212555/http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/foxtel-upfronts-2016-local-thrillers-lifestyle-us-drama.html |archivedate=November 7, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |first=David |last=Knox |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/airdate-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow.html |title=Airdate: DC's Legends of Tomorrow |date=November 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 12, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116141125/http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/airdate-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow.html |archivedate=November 16, 2015 }}</ref> however it was pushed back until January 22.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/New-In-January-200-shows-including-DC-s-Legends-Of-Tomorrow/ba-p/106619 |title=New In January: 200+ shows including DC's Legends Of Tomorrow, Andrew Winter's Tiny House & more |publisher=The Green Room |first=Chuck |last=Purcell |date=December 24, 2015 |accessdate=January 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103045859/http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/New-In-January-200-shows-including-DC-s-Legends-Of-Tomorrow/ba-p/106619 |archivedate=January 3, 2016 }}</ref> It started airing in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sky-takes-legends-tomorrow-uk-843856 |title=DC's 'Legends of Tomorrow' Docks With Sky in U.K. |last=Ritman |first=Alex |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 25, 2015 |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126134506/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sky-takes-legends-tomorrow-uk-843856 |archivedate=November 26, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\"\n|-\n!

Produced and distributed by [[Toho|Toho Studios]], it is the fourth film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Akira Takarada]], [[Yuriko Hoshi]], [[Hiroshi Koizumi]], [[Kenji Sahara]], and [[the Peanuts]], with [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]. In the film, humans beseech the aide of the insect-god [[Mothra]] to stop Godzilla from destroying Japan.\n\nDue to the success of ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (1962), Toho chose to pair Godzilla against Mothra for the following film, with Mothra chosen due to the success of ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961).{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=103}} Honda directly intended for the film to be meant for children in addition to adults, as a way to compete with television's growing popularity in Japan. Notably, it is the final film in the franchise's [[Godzilla (franchise)#Sh\u014dwa period (1954\u20131975)|Sh\u014dwa]] period to depict Godzilla solely as an antagonist.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=206}}\n\n''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was released theatrically in Japan on April 29, 1964. An edited version titled ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'' was released by [[American International Pictures]] in the United States on August 26, 1964. The film was followed by ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', released in the same year on December 20.\n\n==Plot==\nNews reporter Ichiro Sakai and photographer Junko Nakanishi take pictures of wreckage caused by a typhoon. They uncover a strange, bluish-gray object in the debris, not knowing its significance. Later that day, a giant egg is discovered on the shore. The local villagers salvage it and Kumayama, entrepreneur of Happy Enterprises buys the egg from the local villagers. Instead of letting scientists study the egg, Kumayama intends to exploit it. While Sakai, Junko, and Professor Miura are discussing the egg at a hotel, they spot Kumayama checking in. Kumayama meets with Jiro Torahata, the head of Happy Enterprises. They are unexpectedly confronted by tiny twin girls known as the Shobijin and try to capture them. The Shobijin escape and meet with Sakai, Nakanishi and Miura. They explain that the egg belongs to [[Mothra]]. If the egg hatches, the larva will cause great damage looking for food. \n\nThe trio agree to help and attempt to reason with Kumayama and Torahata but fail to do so and the Shobijin leave. Miura informs Sakai and Junko that the strange object they discovered is radioactive and return to the beach to find the source. [[Godzilla]] surfaces from buried mud and attacks [[Nagoya]]. Sakai, Junko, and Miura travel to Infant Island to request the Shobijin to send Mothra to defeat Godzilla. The natives and the Shobijin initially refuse due to the atrocities inflicted on the island and its habitants by nuclear testing, but are eventually convinced. However, the Shobijin warn them that Mothra is too old and nearing death.\n\nKumayama confronts Torahata and demands to get back the money that Torahata had recently swindled from him. Kumayama is shot by Torahata, then he too is killed when Godzilla destroys his hotel. Godzilla advances on the giant egg but is interrupted by Mothra. Mothra initially gains the upper-hand but is defeated by Godzilla's atomic breath, and dies of exhaustion.  The [[JSDF]] launch multiple attacks on Godzilla until two giant larvae hatch from Mothra's egg. They follow Godzilla to Iwa Island, trap it with their silk spray and force Godzilla into the sea. Sakai, Junko, and Miura thank the Mothra larvae and Shobijin as they return to Infant Island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Akira Takarada]] as Ichiro Sakai\n*[[Yuriko Hoshi]] as Junko Nakanishi\n*[[Hiroshi Koizumi]] as Professor Shunsuke Miura\n*[[Y\u016b Fujiki]] as Jiro Nakamura\n*[[The Peanuts]] as the Shobijin\n*[[Kenji Sahara]] as Jiro Torahata\n*[[Jun Tazaki]] as Maruta\n*[[Yoshifumi Tajima]] as Kumayama\n*Kenzo Tabu as the Mayor\n*Akira Tani as the Village Leader\n*[[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nHistorian Steve Ryfle called the film's themes as a \"classic good-versus-evil stand-off\". He noted the film raises philosophical questions about unity and humanity's will to put aside their differences for the greater good. Ryfle refers to Godzilla as a \"specter of nuclear annihilation\", metaphorically casting its shadow over Japan. Ryle also compares Godzilla as a \"symbol of moral judgement\" after indirectly killing the film's villains.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} Actor [[Hiroshi Koizumi]] felt that Honda was able to emphasize his themes through Mothra better than Godzilla, stating, \"Mothra's role was a messenger of peace.\" [[Kenji Sahara]] emphasized that his character \"was a symbol of greed.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=208}} Honda purposely chose to portray the film's version of Infant Island as a partial wasteland, stating, \"I wanted to visualize the terror and the power of the atomic bomb.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\n==Production==\n'''Production credits'''{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=67}}<ref name=\"TCC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/29341-mothra-vs-godzilla|title=Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964) - The Criterion Collection|work=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=April 18, 2020|url-status=live|archivedate=April 18, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200419035318/https://www.criterion.com/films/29341-mothra-vs-godzilla}}</ref>{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=354}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] \u2013 director\n* [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] \u2013 special effects director\n* Koji Kajita \u2013 assistant director\n* Boku Norimoto \u2013 production coordinator\n* Sadamasa Arikawa \u2013 special effects photography\n* Mototaka Tomioka \u2013 special effects photography\n* Akira Watanabe \u2013 special effects art director\n* [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] \u2013 special effects assistant director\n* Takeo Kita \u2013 art director\n* Hiroshi Mukoyama \u2013 optical effects\n* Yokio Manoda \u2013 optical effects\n* Sokei Tomioka \u2013 optical effects\n{{Div col end}}\nBefore production began, Honda discussed with his cast that with the competition television has been posing for the movies, \"[Toho] is targeting kids, not just adults, so we have to make something that all ages will find interesting.\" Producer Tanaka had told Kenji Sahara that he \"wanted a villain with impact\". To prepare for his role, Sahara spent time around \"pushy\" real-estate agents by posing as a buyer.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=208}} Tanaka hired [[The Peanuts]] for publicity, due to their popularity at the time.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=13:28}}\n\n===Writing===\nThe film was originally intended to pick up after ''Mothra'' (1961), with the Rolisicans re-cast as the villains.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} There were several key differences from Sekizawa's earlier drafts: the villain Torahata did not exist; Sakai was accompanied by two scientists, a colleague and a friend's mentor; Godzilla's body washes ashore rather than Mothra's egg; the leads offer themselves as hostages to the Infant Island natives in exchange for Mothra's help; Rolisica was to be attacked by Godzilla; the Frontier Missiles were to be used by the Rolisican military; Himeji Castle was to be destroyed; Godzilla was to move East until reaching close to Tokyo; The artificial lightning tactic is conceived when Godzilla is repelled by electrical towers in Tokyo; Mothra attacks Godzilla when he becomes immune to electricity; Mothra engages Godzilla in a final battle when it stalks the lead characters on a beach. Honda changed much of Sekizawa's original script to accommodate his vision.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=111}}\n\n===Music===\nThe score was composed by Akira Ifukube.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=209}} Ifukube adapted elements from Yuji Koseki's \"Song of Mothra\" theme into his score. At the point in their careers, Honda and Ifukube held planning sessions to discuss which scenes would feature music. Honda and Ifukube had a disagreement over a scene which featured Godzilla rising behind a ridge-line. Honda asked for attack music for the scene but Ifukube refused, feeling that it was unnecessary due to Godzilla being \"impressive enough\". However, Godzilla's theme was added instead, a decision which upset Ifukube.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=210}} The track \"The Sacred Springs\" was the only track Ifukube wrote for [[The Peanuts]]{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=46:02}} and was intended to be lament for Infant Island's destruction.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=47:05}}\n\n===Special effects===\nThe film's special effects were directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], while [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] served as the assistant special effects director.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=67}} For Godzilla, the new suit was built by Teizo Toshimitsu, with [[Haruo Nakajima]] giving input whenever visiting the workshop. This led to a lighter suit that awarded Nakajima more fluid movement. Reinforced heels were added to the suit's feet which gave Nakajima freedom to roll and flip without losing his footing. The suit was constructed two months prior to filming.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} The 1962 Godzilla suit was recycled for water scenes and the shot with Godzilla tumbling off the cliff.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:18:57}} For Mothra, a new prop was built, similar to the 1961 prop, with Y-shaped braced attached to the back that allowed the wings to flap. High-powered fans were used to create wind for Mothra's wings.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} The wing-span for the new Mothra prop was 15 feet.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=51:55}} Mechanism were added that allowed the prop to move the head and legs via remote control.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=52:06}}\n\nMechanical props and puppets were built for both monsters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=107}} The two larvas were a combination of hand puppetry and motor-driven mechanical props. The larva web was a petroleum based product which was liquified polystyrene. When the web was shot off-screen, it was poured onto a cup stationed at the center of a heavy industrial fan. The cup was sealed with small gaps around the edges.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:23:56}} To shoot the webs out of the larva's mouth, a canister of compressed air was run into a sealed tube of liquid polystyrene. At a high pressure level, the liquid polystyrene was forced through a tube that ran through the back of the larva and into the nozzle installed on the mouth. As long as the nozzle was small, the solution vaporized when first emitted and solidified into the trademark web.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:24:42}} Gasoline had to be used to remove the webbing and to prevent the suit from combusting, it had to be thoroughly dried.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:25:23}}\n\nThe larva movements were designed by Soujiro Iijima by using a conveyor belt with rotating gears that allowed the bodies to move up and down.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:19:12}} For the scenes with the Fairies, oversized furniture were built eight times their size to make the Fairies appear to look 30 centimeters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=107}} Honda had originally intended to depict the wasteland part of Infant Island with more realism and graphic imagery but this idea was dropped due to budgetary issues with the art department. Honda would later regret this decision, feeling he should have been more \"stubborn.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\nTsuburaya had Toho purchase an Oxberry 1900 optical printer which helped remove damages for composite photography shots. The optical printer was also used to create Godzilla's atomic breath. For the Nagoya Castle scene, Nakajima was unable to completely destroy the model. Nakajima attempted to salvage the shot by having Godzilla appear enraged by the Castle's strong fortification, however, the model was rebuilt to crumble more easily, with the scene having to be re-shot. For the scene with Mothra dragging Godzilla by the tail, the Godzilla suit was used for medium shots and a prop used for long shots.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} An additional sequence was filmed for the overseas version, which featured the United States military attacking Godzilla with frontier missiles. This sequences was omitted from the Japanese version.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=209}}\n\nThe Mothra prop used for the New Kirk City scenes in ''Mothra'' (1961) was recycled for the Infant Island scenes. This prop was smaller compared to the new prop built for the film's adult Mothra. The 1961 model had a motor built into it that flapped the wings at a rapid pace.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=51:02}} For the scenes with Godzilla near the cliff face, part of the set's support structure was hidden by using matte painting.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=53:35}} The miniature tanks used in the film were purchased from Ihara models rather than typically custom built. The tank models were built to a 1/15th scale and were constructed from aluminum. The antennas were used for remote control.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=54:14}}\n\nFor the scene where Godzilla destroys the incubator, the scene proved difficult for Nakajima and the wire staff, which required coordination. Close ups of the tail were done with a prop that was operated by two people due to the heavy weight of the tail.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=58:47}} The scenes with Godzilla thrashing wildly at Mothra were shot at high speed, then projected at a quicker speed. The end results have been compared to the movement of stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:03:11}} The scene with Godzilla thrashing from the nets was shot with different cameras at once and as a result, the same scene plays over from different angles.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:12:16}}\n\nA second egg was produced for the hatching scene. A styrofoam egg was molded and a calcium carbonate substance was mixed with glue and added on top. The styrofoam egg was removed from its interior with a heated wire, which felt a hollow form.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:16:29}} For the opening typhoon scene, Iijima built a shallow water tank to create the illusion of violent waves. Wider water scenes were filmed at Toho's massive stage pool.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:19:37}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was released in Japan by [[Toho]] on April 29, 1964, some time prior to the [[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]] and sold 3.5 million tickets.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=211}} According to [[Henry G. Saperstein]], the film grossed $217,000 for three weeks from eight theaters in Tokyo.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=110}} The film was re-released theatrically in Japan in 1980 and sold 3 million tickets.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\n===American version===\nIn May 1964, Henry G. Saperstein acquired the American theatrical and television rights to the film, under the proposed working title ''Godzilla vs. the Giant Moth'', and sold the rights to [[American International Pictures]]. AIP released the film as ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'' on August 26, 1964, where it premiered in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=103}} AIP chose the title ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'' purposely to generate curiosity and anticipation for Godzilla's foe. AIP hired [[Reynold Brown]] to create a poster that featured Godzilla, but censored the other monster.

Produced and distributed by [[Toho|Toho Studios]], it is the fourth film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Akira Takarada]], [[Yuriko Hoshi]], [[Hiroshi Koizumi]], [[Kenji Sahara]], and [[the Peanuts]], with [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]. In the film, humans beseech the aide of the insect-god [[Mothra]] to stop Godzilla from destroying Japan.\n\nDue to the success of ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (1962), Toho chose to pair Godzilla against Mothra for the following film, with Mothra chosen due to the success of ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961).{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=103}} Honda directly intended for the film to be meant for children in addition to adults, as a way to compete with television's growing popularity in Japan. Notably, it is the final film in the franchise's [[Godzilla (franchise)#Sh\u014dwa period (1954\u20131975)|Sh\u014dwa]] period to depict Godzilla solely as an antagonist.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=206}}\n\n''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was released theatrically in Japan on April 20, 1964. An edited version titled ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'' was released by [[American International Pictures]] in the United States on August 26, 1964. The film was followed by ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', released in the same year on December 20.\n\n==Plot==\nNews reporter Ichiro Sakai and photographer Junko Nakanishi take pictures of wreckage caused by a typhoon. They uncover a strange, bluish-gray object in the debris, not knowing its significance. Later that day, a giant egg is discovered on the shore. The local villagers salvage it and Kumayama, entrepreneur of Happy Enterprises buys the egg from the local villagers. Instead of letting scientists study the egg, Kumayama intends to exploit it. While Sakai, Junko, and Professor Miura are discussing the egg at a hotel, they spot Kumayama checking in. Kumayama meets with Jiro Torahata, the head of Happy Enterprises. They are unexpectedly confronted by tiny twin girls known as the Shobijin and try to capture them. The Shobijin escape and meet with Sakai, Nakanishi and Miura. They explain that the egg belongs to [[Mothra]]. If the egg hatches, the larva will cause great damage looking for food. \n\nThe trio agree to help and attempt to reason with Kumayama and Torahata but fail to do so and the Shobijin leave. Miura informs Sakai and Junko that the strange object they discovered is radioactive and return to the beach to find the source. [[Godzilla]] surfaces from buried mud and attacks [[Nagoya]]. Sakai, Junko, and Miura travel to Infant Island to request the Shobijin to send Mothra to defeat Godzilla. The natives and the Shobijin initially refuse due to the atrocities inflicted on the island and its habitants by nuclear testing, but are eventually convinced. However, the Shobijin warn them that Mothra is too old and nearing death.\n\nKumayama confronts Torahata and demands to get back the money that Torahata had recently swindled from him. Kumayama is shot by Torahata, then he too is killed when Godzilla destroys his hotel. Godzilla advances on the giant egg but is interrupted by Mothra. Mothra initially gains the upper-hand but is defeated by Godzilla's atomic breath, and dies of exhaustion.  The [[JSDF]] launch multiple attacks on Godzilla until two giant larvae hatch from Mothra's egg. They follow Godzilla to Iwa Island, trap it with their silk spray and force Godzilla into the sea. Sakai, Junko, and Miura thank the Mothra larvae and Shobijin as they return to Infant Island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Akira Takarada]] as Ichiro Sakai\n*[[Yuriko Hoshi]] as Junko Nakanishi\n*[[Hiroshi Koizumi]] as Professor Shunsuke Miura\n*[[Y\u016b Fujiki]] as Jiro Nakamura\n*[[The Peanuts]] as the Shobijin\n*[[Kenji Sahara]] as Jiro Torahata\n*[[Jun Tazaki]] as Maruta\n*[[Yoshifumi Tajima]] as Kumayama\n*Kenzo Tabu as the Mayor\n*Akira Tani as the Village Leader\n*[[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nHistorian Steve Ryfle called the film's themes as a \"classic good-versus-evil stand-off\". He noted the film raises philosophical questions about unity and humanity's will to put aside their differences for the greater good. Ryfle refers to Godzilla as a \"specter of nuclear annihilation\", metaphorically casting its shadow over Japan. Ryle also compares Godzilla as a \"symbol of moral judgement\" after indirectly killing the film's villains.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} Actor [[Hiroshi Koizumi]] felt that Honda was able to emphasize his themes through Mothra better than Godzilla, stating, \"Mothra's role was a messenger of peace.\" [[Kenji Sahara]] emphasized that his character \"was a symbol of greed.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=208}} Honda purposely chose to portray the film's version of Infant Island as a partial wasteland, stating, \"I wanted to visualize the terror and the power of the atomic bomb.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\n==Production==\n'''Production credits'''{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=67}}<ref name=\"TCC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/29341-mothra-vs-godzilla|title=Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964) - The Criterion Collection|work=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=April 18, 2020|url-status=live|archivedate=April 18, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200419035318/https://www.criterion.com/films/29341-mothra-vs-godzilla}}</ref>{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=354}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] \u2013 director\n* [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] \u2013 special effects director\n* Koji Kajita \u2013 assistant director\n* Boku Norimoto \u2013 production coordinator\n* Sadamasa Arikawa \u2013 special effects photography\n* Mototaka Tomioka \u2013 special effects photography\n* Akira Watanabe \u2013 special effects art director\n* [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] \u2013 special effects assistant director\n* Takeo Kita \u2013 art director\n* Hiroshi Mukoyama \u2013 optical effects\n* Yokio Manoda \u2013 optical effects\n* Sokei Tomioka \u2013 optical effects\n{{Div col end}}\nBefore production began, Honda discussed with his cast that with the competition television has been posing for the movies, \"[Toho] is targeting kids, not just adults, so we have to make something that all ages will find interesting.\" Producer Tanaka had told Kenji Sahara that he \"wanted a villain with impact\". To prepare for his role, Sahara spent time around \"pushy\" real-estate agents by posing as a buyer.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=208}} Tanaka hired [[The Peanuts]] for publicity, due to their popularity at the time.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=13:28}}\n\n===Writing===\nThe film was originally intended to pick up after ''Mothra'' (1961), with the Rolisicans re-cast as the villains.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=105}} There were several key differences from Sekizawa's earlier drafts: the villain Torahata did not exist; Sakai was accompanied by two scientists, a colleague and a friend's mentor; Godzilla's body washes ashore rather than Mothra's egg; the leads offer themselves as hostages to the Infant Island natives in exchange for Mothra's help; Rolisica was to be attacked by Godzilla; the Frontier Missiles were to be used by the Rolisican military; Himeji Castle was to be destroyed; Godzilla was to move East until reaching close to Tokyo; The artificial lightning tactic is conceived when Godzilla is repelled by electrical towers in Tokyo; Mothra attacks Godzilla when he becomes immune to electricity; Mothra engages Godzilla in a final battle when it stalks the lead characters on a beach. Honda changed much of Sekizawa's original script to accommodate his vision.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=111}}\n\n===Music===\nThe score was composed by Akira Ifukube.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=209}} Ifukube adapted elements from Yuji Koseki's \"Song of Mothra\" theme into his score. At the point in their careers, Honda and Ifukube held planning sessions to discuss which scenes would feature music. Honda and Ifukube had a disagreement over a scene which featured Godzilla rising behind a ridge-line. Honda asked for attack music for the scene but Ifukube refused, feeling that it was unnecessary due to Godzilla being \"impressive enough\". However, Godzilla's theme was added instead, a decision which upset Ifukube.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=210}} The track \"The Sacred Springs\" was the only track Ifukube wrote for [[The Peanuts]]{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=46:02}} and was intended to be lament for Infant Island's destruction.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=47:05}}\n\n===Special effects===\nThe film's special effects were directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], while [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] served as the assistant special effects director.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=67}} For Godzilla, the new suit was built by Teizo Toshimitsu, with [[Haruo Nakajima]] giving input whenever visiting the workshop. This led to a lighter suit that awarded Nakajima more fluid movement. Reinforced heels were added to the suit's feet which gave Nakajima freedom to roll and flip without losing his footing. The suit was constructed two months prior to filming.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} The 1962 Godzilla suit was recycled for water scenes and the shot with Godzilla tumbling off the cliff.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:18:57}} For Mothra, a new prop was built, similar to the 1961 prop, with Y-shaped braced attached to the back that allowed the wings to flap. High-powered fans were used to create wind for Mothra's wings.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} The wing-span for the new Mothra prop was 15 feet.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=51:55}} Mechanism were added that allowed the prop to move the head and legs via remote control.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=52:06}}\n\nMechanical props and puppets were built for both monsters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=107}} The two larvas were a combination of hand puppetry and motor-driven mechanical props. The larva web was a petroleum based product which was liquified polystyrene. When the web was shot off-screen, it was poured onto a cup stationed at the center of a heavy industrial fan. The cup was sealed with small gaps around the edges.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:23:56}} To shoot the webs out of the larva's mouth, a canister of compressed air was run into a sealed tube of liquid polystyrene. At a high pressure level, the liquid polystyrene was forced through a tube that ran through the back of the larva and into the nozzle installed on the mouth. As long as the nozzle was small, the solution vaporized when first emitted and solidified into the trademark web.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:24:42}} Gasoline had to be used to remove the webbing and to prevent the suit from combusting, it had to be thoroughly dried.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:25:23}}\n\nThe larva movements were designed by Soujiro Iijima by using a conveyor belt with rotating gears that allowed the bodies to move up and down.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:19:12}} For the scenes with the Fairies, oversized furniture were built eight times their size to make the Fairies appear to look 30 centimeters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=107}} Honda had originally intended to depict the wasteland part of Infant Island with more realism and graphic imagery but this idea was dropped due to budgetary issues with the art department. Honda would later regret this decision, feeling he should have been more \"stubborn.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\nTsuburaya had Toho purchase an Oxberry 1900 optical printer which helped remove damages for composite photography shots. The optical printer was also used to create Godzilla's atomic breath. For the Nagoya Castle scene, Nakajima was unable to completely destroy the model. Nakajima attempted to salvage the shot by having Godzilla appear enraged by the Castle's strong fortification, however, the model was rebuilt to crumble more easily, with the scene having to be re-shot. For the scene with Mothra dragging Godzilla by the tail, the Godzilla suit was used for medium shots and a prop used for long shots.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=108}} An additional sequence was filmed for the overseas version, which featured the United States military attacking Godzilla with frontier missiles. This sequences was omitted from the Japanese version.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=209}}\n\nThe Mothra prop used for the New Kirk City scenes in ''Mothra'' (1961) was recycled for the Infant Island scenes. This prop was smaller compared to the new prop built for the film's adult Mothra. The 1961 model had a motor built into it that flapped the wings at a rapid pace.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=51:02}} For the scenes with Godzilla near the cliff face, part of the set's support structure was hidden by using matte painting.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=53:35}} The miniature tanks used in the film were purchased from Ihara models rather than typically custom built. The tank models were built to a 1/15th scale and were constructed from aluminum. The antennas were used for remote control.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=54:14}}\n\nFor the scene where Godzilla destroys the incubator, the scene proved difficult for Nakajima and the wire staff, which required coordination. Close ups of the tail were done with a prop that was operated by two people due to the heavy weight of the tail.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=58:47}} The scenes with Godzilla thrashing wildly at Mothra were shot at high speed, then projected at a quicker speed. The end results have been compared to the movement of stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:03:11}} The scene with Godzilla thrashing from the nets was shot with different cameras at once and as a result, the same scene plays over from different angles.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:12:16}}\n\nA second egg was produced for the hatching scene. A styrofoam egg was molded and a calcium carbonate substance was mixed with glue and added on top. The styrofoam egg was removed from its interior with a heated wire, which felt a hollow form.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:16:29}} For the opening typhoon scene, Iijima built a shallow water tank to create the illusion of violent waves. Wider water scenes were filmed at Toho's massive stage pool.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=01:19:37}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was released in Japan by [[Toho]] on April 20, 1964, some time prior to the [[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]] and sold 3.5 million tickets.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=211}} According to [[Henry G. Saperstein]], the film grossed $217,000 for three weeks from eight theaters in Tokyo.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=110}} The film was re-released theatrically in Japan in 1980 and sold 3 million tickets.{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=211}}\n\n===American version===\nIn May 1964, Henry G. Saperstein acquired the American theatrical and television rights to the film, under the proposed working title ''Godzilla vs. the Giant Moth'', and sold the rights to [[American International Pictures]]. AIP released the film as ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'' on August 26, 1964, where it premiered in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=103}} AIP chose the title ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'' purposely to generate curiosity and anticipation for Godzilla's foe. AIP hired [[Reynold Brown]] to create a poster that featured Godzilla, but censored the other monster. Brown was paid $350 for his services.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=40:25}}\n\nThe American version of the film contains footage shot by Toho specifically for the American release.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=210}} The American version of the film received only a few minor adjustments: shortening the twin fairies' song on Infant Island and a scene where Sakai, Junko Miura and Makamura wave goodbye to the Mothras swimming home.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=110}} Removed scenes include Kumayama handing out leaflets to attract visitors to the giant egg incubator and where Torahata shoots Kumayama in a hotel room.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=110}} New scenes were also added including a sequence where U.S. military officials help Japan against Godzilla.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=110}} The American release of the film was double-billed with ''[[Voyage to the End of the Universe]]''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=210}} AIP hired [[Titra Studios]] to dub the film into English.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=23:57}}\n\n===Critical response===\nA 1964 review for Kinema Junpo praised the effects but criticized the military attacking Godzilla, stating, \"It's strange that the people don't learn from the past. From the Self-Defense Forces on down, every single person just plain looks stupid.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=211}} In a contemporary review from the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', the review noted that \"In spite of some clumsy model shots, Godzilla's fight with the giant moth and its caterpillar progeny is one of Toho's better efforts\".<ref name=\"mfb\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Godzilla Tai Mothra (Godzilla vs. The Thing), Japan, 1964|volume=32|issue=372|page=167|year=1965|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref> The review praised the monsters design in the film and opined that the \"ineffectual attempts to bring him to a halt are cleverly and spectacularly staged. Unfortunately, nothing else quite matches the special effects\", noting a plot that was \"ridiculous\" and acting that was \"lamentable, and the two miniature twins' habit of repeating every line of dialogue simultaneously is intensely irksome.\"<ref name=\"mfb\" />\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented that the film was a \"Japanese sci-fi long on special effects but lacks appeal for general trade\", and that \"inspite of the slick production, the story and acting don't offer enough to attract large general audiences.\"{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=181|ps=: \"Review is of American version viewed on September 17, 1964\"}} The review commented that \"virtually all-Japanese cast, with unfamiliar faces and broad emoting typical of such Japanese pics, also detracts from general appeal.\"{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=181|ps=: \"Review is of American version viewed on September 17, 1964\"}} The review commented on the film crew, stating that Honda's direction and the script \"keep story moving at lively pace, building up to tense climatic scenes\"{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=181|ps=: \"Review is of American version viewed on September 17, 1964\"}} and that \"Eiji Tsuburaya, labored mightily to cook up monsters and their battles, the tiny twins and the military assaults against Godzilla.\"{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=181|ps=: \"Review is of American version viewed on September 17, 1964\"}}\n\nFrom a retrospective review in 1998, Steve Ryfle, author of ''Japan's Favorite Mon-star: The Unauthorized Biography of \"The Big G\"'' praised the film as it stood \"indisputably as the greatest of all the Godzilla sequels, with a fast-paced story and likable characters, the most impressive Godzilla design ever, two of the Big G's most spectacular battles, and an abundance of special-effects \"money shots\" that evoke the thrills of the 1954 original.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=103}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=104}} In his 2017 book cowritten with Ed Godziszewski and covering Ishiro Honda's filmography, the two gave their impression that \"[t]he final twenty-plus minutes hint at the genre's impending tilt toward young boys. It's a near nonstop barrage of military hardware and monster action\", and adding that \"Honda seemed to know that kids were now rooting for Godzilla, and so the film never gets too scary.\"{{sfn|Ryfle & Godziszewski|2017|p=208}}\n\nRyfle praised the English dubbing for the American version, feeling that it's one of the reasons why the film is considered amongst the best Godzilla films. Ryfle felt that the English script was \"snappy\" and \"well written\" and that the voice performances sounded sincere and pulled with effort, stating, \"You'd be hard pressed to find another movie where the dubbing is done as well as it is here.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2007|loc=23:15}}\n\n==Home media==\n===Japan===\nIn 1983, the Japanese version was released on VHS in Japan by Toho.
