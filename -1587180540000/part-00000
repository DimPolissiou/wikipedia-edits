With its original name \"Afghan University Peshawar\", it was initially established in 2000 in [[Peshawar]]. It was shifted to Khost by special orders of the former Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]]. The university was named after Shaikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], the first President of the [[United Arab Emirates]], who sponsored the construction of its campus in Khost.\n\nShaikh Zayed University was officially registered in 2003. The work on the university was officially started during [[Hakim Taniwal]]'s governorship of Khost Province. The next governor Patan made a trip to the UAE (United Arab Emirates), and requested funds for the completion of the university. In order to honor UAE's help, the university was renamed Shaikh Zayed University. Governor Patan had a track record for opening schools, and supporting education for all genders, so it was only natural for him to push for the construction of Shaikh Zayed University.

With its original name \"Afghan University Peshawar\", it was initially established in 2000 in [[Peshawar]]. It was shifted to Khost by special orders of the former Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]]. The university was named after Shaikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], the first President of the [[United Arab Emirates]], who sponsored the construction of its campus in Khost. \n\nShaikh Zayed University was officially registered in 2003. The work on the university was officially started during [[Hakim Taniwal]]'s governorship of Khost Province. The next governor Patan made a trip to the UAE (United Arab Emirates), and requested funds for the completion of the university. In order to honor UAE's help, the university was renamed Shaikh Zayed University. Governor Patan had a track record for opening schools, and supporting education for all genders, so it was only natural for him to push for the construction of Shaikh Zayed University. The university's new campus was officially inaugurated in March 2008.\n\nShaikh Zayed University has nine faculties and more than 3000 students. It has a private radio station for journalism faculty.

The track is home to numerous prestigious races including both the [[Santa Anita Derby]] and the [[Santa Anita Handicap]] as well as hosting the [[Breeders' Cup]] in 1986, 1993, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. Since 2011, [[The Stronach Group]] are the current owners.\n\n==History==\nSanta Anita Park was originally part of \"[[Rancho Santa Anita]]\", which was owned originally by former San Gabriel Mission Mayor-Domo, Claudio Lopez, and named after a family member, \"Anita Cota\". The ranch was later acquired by rancher [[Hugo Reid]], a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]]. Later, it was owned by multimillionaire horse breeder and racer [[Lucky Baldwin]]. Baldwin initially built a racetrack adjacent to the present site in what is today Arcadia, outside of the city of [[Los Angeles]], in 1904. It closed in 1909 and burned down in 1912.\n\nIn 1933, California legalized [[parimutuel]] wagering and several investor groups worked to open racetracks. In the [[San Francisco]] area, a group headed by [[Charles H. Strub|Dr. Charles H \"Doc\" Strub]] was having trouble locating a site.  In the Los Angeles area, a group headed by movie producer [[Hal Roach]] was in need of further funds.  These two groups combined and the newly formed Los Angeles Turf Club opened the present day track on Christmas Day in 1934, making it the first formally-established racetrack in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santaanitaparkracing.com/|title=Santa Anita Park Thoroughbred Race Track|work=santaanitaparkracing.com}}</ref> Architect [[Gordon Kaufmann]] designed its various buildings in a combination of [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] and a type of [[art deco]] known as [[Streamline Modern]], painted primarily in Santa Anita's signature colors of [[Shades of green|Persian Green]] and [[Lemon chiffon|Chiffon Yellow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/santa-anita-park|title=Santa Anita Park|work=laconservancy.org}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1935, the first [[Santa Anita Handicap]] was run. The race's $100,000 purse, largest of any race ever in the United States until that time, produced its nickname the Big 'Cap. \n[[Image:SantaAnitaEntrance wb.jpg|thumb|left|Art deco entrance to Santa Anita's grandstands.]]\n\nIn its heyday, the track's races attracted such stars [[Betty Grable]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Esther Williams]], and other stars. [[Bing Crosby]], [[Joe E. Brown]], [[Al Jolson]], and [[Harry Warner]] were all stockholders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dyer|first=Braven|title=The Story of Santa Anita|url=http://www.sportthemagazine.com/1947/01/the-story-of-santa-anita/|work=SPORT Magazine|accessdate=10 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311064339/http://www.sportthemagazine.com/1947/01/the-story-of-santa-anita/|archivedate=11 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Santa Anita Track (3446121612).jpg|thumb|The unique downhill turf course includes a section where horses have to momentarily cross the dirt track]]\nIn 1940, [[Seabiscuit]] won the Santa Anita Handicap in his last start.\n\nIn 1942, racing at Santa Anita was suspended due to the [[Second World War]]. Santa Anita was used as an \"assembly center\" for [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans excluded]] from the West Coast.<ref name=hmdb>{{cite web|title=Santa Anita During World War II|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=68088|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> (See [[Santa Anita Park#Santa Anita Assembly Center|below]].) For several months in 1942, over 18,000 people lived in horse stables and military-style barracks constructed on the site, including actor [[George Takei]], then a young boy. After the track reopened in 1945,<ref name=hmdb /> it went through the postwar years with prosperity. A downhill turf course, which added a distinctly European flair to racing at Santa Anita, was added in 1953.\n\nDue to its proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Anita has traditionally been associated with the film and television industries. The racetrack sequences in the [[Marx Brothers]] 1937 classic ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' were filmed there, and ''[[The Story of Seabiscuit]]'' with [[Shirley Temple]] was filmed on location in 1949.<ref name=\"Seabiscuit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/western-region/santa-anita-racetrack.html|title=Plan your next trip with the National Trust - National Trust for Historic Preservation|website=Preservationnation.org|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref> It was also featured in ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937).<ref>Alleman, Richard (2013).

In 1968<!-- this said 19689 so not sure whether '68 or '69; i guessed. -elf -->, [[Del Mar Racetrack]] relinquished its dates for a fall meeting. A group of horsemen including [[Clement L. Hirsch|Clement Hirsch]] intervened and established the not-for-profit [[Oak Tree Racing Association]]. Oak Tree had no facilities of its own and rented Santa Anita Park for its first autumn meeting in 1969. The Oak Tree Association became the operator of the autumn meet at Santa Anita Park. This meet usually ran from the end of September until early November. Many key stakes races were held during the Oak Tree Meeting, including many preps to the [[Breeders' Cup]] races. The Oak Tree meet relocated to [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] for 2010<ref>[http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/58471/oak-tree-headed-for-hollywood-after-all \"Oak Tree Headed for Hollywood After All\"], ''The Blood-Horse'', August 19, 2010.</ref> but the California Horse Racing Board awarded the fall dates to Santa Anita in its own right in 2011. This prompted a renaming of many stakes races held at the fall meeting that were formerly associated with Oak Tree. For example, the Norfolk, Goodwood, Yellow Ribbon, Lady's Secret, and Oak Leaf, were renamed at the FrontRunner, Awesome Again, Rodeo Drive, Zenyatta and Chandelier respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Larry|title=Santa Anita's horse racing Fall Meet is not Oak Tree anymore|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/ZZ/20120928/NEWS/120927766|website=Dailybreeze.com|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nProsperity continued at Santa Anita throughout the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1984, Santa Anita was the site of [[Equestrian at the 1984 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] events at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1.

However, recognizing the potential revenue boon to the State of California, the California Legislature expanded off track betting, bring operating betting parlors within closer driving distance of the race-day tracks. While the Santa Anita meeting could still draw large crowds, attendance had decreased by a third.  Only 56,810 people were at the park for Santa Anita Derby Day 2007 to witness a Grade I event.\n\n[[Image:Seabiscuit statue.png|right|thumb|The Seabiscuit statue, created by American sculptor Jame Hughlette (\"Tex\") Wheeler<ref>Dickinson, J.

Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized military commanders to exclude \"any or all persons\" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the [[Western Defense Command]] began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for \"evacuation\" from the newly created military zones. Seventeen temporary \"assembly centers\" were designated to house the evicted population until construction on the more permanent and isolated internment camps was finished. Most, like the [[Santa Anita assembly center]], were converted from former uses like racing tracks or fairgrounds.<ref name=Linke>Linke, Konrad. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Santa%20Anita%20%28detention%20facility%29/ \"Santa Anita (detention facility)\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 2014-07-25.</ref>\n\nSanta Anita was turned over to the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the government body responsible for oversight of the temporary detention facilities, in March 1942, and army engineers soon after built 500 barracks on the parking lot and converted the horse stables and the area underneath the grandstand into residential \"apartments\". Inmates began arriving in April, most coming from the surrounding Los Angeles County, and the center's population soon topped 18,000, peaking at 18,719 by August of that year. Six mess halls, each seating approximately 850 at a time, fed some 3,000 people daily at a cost of 33 cents per inmate. The sanitary facilities faced similar overcrowding, with a ratio of 30 inmates to each shower ''after'' the number of showers was increased from 150 to 225 in early July. Consequently, inmates spent a significant portion of their time in Santa Anita waiting in line for meals or to use the sanitary facilities.<ref name=Linke/>\n\nThe Assembly Center remained open for seven months, and in the meantime, inmates took up jobs in camp at the camouflage net factory, the hospital or various administrative departments, and set up schools to ensure their children's education would not be interrupted. Transfer to [[War Relocation Authority]] camps began on August 26, 1942, when 901 inmates left for [[Poston War Relocation Center|Poston]], Arizona, and over the next month the remaining Japanese Americans were sent to Poston and several other camps. The Santa Anita Assembly Center closed on October 27, 1942.<ref name=Linke/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/08/local/me-then8|title=Santa Anita racetrack played a role in WWII internment|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 8, 2009|first=Alison|last=Bell}}</ref>\n\n==Course attributes==\n[[Image:SantaAnitaTrackMtns wb.jpg|thumb|right|The Santa Anita track is set against the backdrop of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].]]Santa Anita has a one-mile (1,609 m) natural dirt main track which rings a turf course measuring 0.9 mile, or {{convert|1,584|yd|m}}.

The new Cushion Track opened for training on Sept 4, 2007 and hosted its first live race on Sept 26, 2007. The track lost 11 racing dates in 2008 due to a drainage problem with the new material, but intensive maintenance and the addition of a liquid binder greatly improved the artificial surface.  Santa Anita replaced the artificial surface with a return to an all natural dirt surface in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.santaanita.com/press/pressrelease/2010/12/santa-anita-main-track-reopens-training-natural-dirt-surface-withstands |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234615/http://www.santaanita.com/press/pressrelease/2010/12/santa-anita-main-track-reopens-training-natural-dirt-surface-withstands |archivedate=2011-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nSanta Anita occupies {{convert|320|acre|km2}}.

It offers some of the prominent horse racing events in the United States during early fall, winter and in spring. The track is home to numerous prestigious races including both the [[Santa Anita Derby]] and the [[Santa Anita Handicap]] as well as hosting the [[Breeders' Cup]] in 1986, 1993, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. Since 2011, [[The Stronach Group]] are the current owners.\n\n==History==\nSanta Anita Park was originally part of \"[[Rancho Santa Anita]]\", which was owned originally by former San Gabriel Mission Mayor-Domo, Claudio Lopez, and named after a family member, \"Anita Cota\". The ranch was later acquired by rancher [[Hugo Reid]], a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]]. Later, it was owned by multimillionaire horse breeder and racer [[Lucky Baldwin]]. Baldwin initially built a racetrack adjacent to the present site in what is today Arcadia, outside of the city of [[Los Angeles]], in 1904. It closed in 1909 and burned down in 1912.\n\nIn 1933, California legalized [[parimutuel]] wagering and several investor groups worked to open racetracks. In the [[San Francisco]] area, a group headed by [[Charles H. Strub|Dr. Charles H \"Doc\" Strub]] was having trouble locating a site.  In the Los Angeles area, a group headed by movie producer [[Hal Roach]] was in need of further funds.  These two groups combined and the newly formed Los Angeles Turf Club opened the present day track on Christmas Day in 1934, making it the first formally-established racetrack in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santaanitaparkracing.com/|title=Santa Anita Park Thoroughbred Race Track|work=santaanitaparkracing.com}}</ref> Architect [[Gordon Kaufmann]] designed its various buildings in a combination of [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] and a type of [[art deco]] known as [[Streamline Modern]], painted primarily in Santa Anita's signature colors of [[Shades of green|Persian Green]] and [[Lemon chiffon|Chiffon Yellow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/santa-anita-park|title=Santa Anita Park|work=laconservancy.org}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1935, the first [[Santa Anita Handicap]] was run. The race's $100,000 purse, largest of any race ever in the United States until that time, produced its nickname the Big 'Cap. \n[[Image:SantaAnitaEntrance wb.jpg|thumb|left|Art deco entrance to Santa Anita's grandstands.]]\n\nIn its heyday, the track's races attracted such stars [[Betty Grable]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Esther Williams]], and other stars. [[Bing Crosby]], [[Joe E. Brown]], [[Al Jolson]], and [[Harry Warner]] were all stockholders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dyer|first=Braven|title=The Story of Santa Anita|url=http://www.sportthemagazine.com/1947/01/the-story-of-santa-anita/|work=SPORT Magazine|accessdate=10 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311064339/http://www.sportthemagazine.com/1947/01/the-story-of-santa-anita/|archivedate=11 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Santa Anita Track (3446121612).jpg|thumb|The unique downhill turf course includes a section where horses have to momentarily cross the dirt track]]\nIn 1940, [[Seabiscuit]] won the Santa Anita Handicap in his last start.\n\nIn 1942, racing at Santa Anita was suspended due to the [[Second World War]]. Santa Anita was used as an \"assembly center\" for [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans excluded]] from the West Coast.<ref name=hmdb>{{cite web|title=Santa Anita During World War II|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=68088|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> (See [[Santa Anita Park#Santa Anita Assembly Center|below]].) For several months in 1942, over 18,000 people lived in horse stables and military-style barracks constructed on the site, including actor [[George Takei]], then a young boy. After the track reopened in 1945,<ref name=hmdb /> it went through the postwar years with prosperity. A downhill turf course, which added a distinctly European flair to racing at Santa Anita, was added in 1953.\n\nDue to its proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Anita has traditionally been associated with the film and television industries. The racetrack sequences in the [[Marx Brothers]] 1937 classic ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' were filmed there, and ''[[The Story of Seabiscuit]]'' with [[Shirley Temple]] was filmed on location in 1949.<ref name=\"Seabiscuit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/western-region/santa-anita-racetrack.html|title=Plan your next trip with the National Trust - National Trust for Historic Preservation|website=Preservationnation.org|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref> It was also featured in ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937).<ref>Alleman, Richard (2013).

In 1968<!-- this said 19689 so not sure whether '68 or '69; i guessed. -elf -->, [[Del Mar Racetrack]] relinquished its dates for a fall meeting. A group of horsemen including [[Clement L. Hirsch|Clement Hirsch]] intervened and established the not-for-profit [[Oak Tree Racing Association]]. Oak Tree had no facilities of its own and rented Santa Anita Park for its first autumn meeting in 1969. The Oak Tree Association became the operator of the autumn meet at Santa Anita Park. This meet usually ran from the end of September until early November. Many key stakes races were held during the Oak Tree Meeting, including many preps to the [[Breeders' Cup]] races. The Oak Tree meet relocated to [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] for 2010<ref>[http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/58471/oak-tree-headed-for-hollywood-after-all \"Oak Tree Headed for Hollywood After All\"], ''The Blood-Horse'', August 19, 2010.</ref> but the California Horse Racing Board awarded the fall dates to Santa Anita in its own right in 2011. This prompted a renaming of many stakes races held at the fall meeting that were formerly associated with Oak Tree. For example, the Norfolk, Goodwood, Yellow Ribbon, Lady's Secret, and Oak Leaf, were renamed at the FrontRunner, Awesome Again, Rodeo Drive, Zenyatta and Chandelier respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Larry|title=Santa Anita's horse racing Fall Meet is not Oak Tree anymore|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/ZZ/20120928/NEWS/120927766|website=Dailybreeze.com|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nProsperity continued at Santa Anita throughout the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1984, Santa Anita was the site of [[Equestrian at the 1984 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] events at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1.

However, recognizing the potential revenue boon to the State of California, the California Legislature expanded off track betting, bring operating betting parlors within closer driving distance of the race-day tracks. While the Santa Anita meeting could still draw large crowds, attendance had decreased by a third.  Only 56,810 people were at the park for Santa Anita Derby Day 2007 to witness a Grade I event.\n\n[[Image:Seabiscuit statue.png|right|thumb|The Seabiscuit statue, created by American sculptor Jame Hughlette (\"Tex\") Wheeler<ref>Dickinson, J.

Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized military commanders to exclude \"any or all persons\" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the [[Western Defense Command]] began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for \"evacuation\" from the newly created military zones. Seventeen temporary \"assembly centers\" were designated to house the evicted population until construction on the more permanent and isolated internment camps was finished. Most, like the [[Santa Anita assembly center]], were converted from former uses like racing tracks or fairgrounds.<ref name=Linke>Linke, Konrad. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Santa%20Anita%20%28detention%20facility%29/ \"Santa Anita (detention facility)\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 2014-07-25.</ref>\n\nSanta Anita was turned over to the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the government body responsible for oversight of the temporary detention facilities, in March 1942, and army engineers soon after built 500 barracks on the parking lot and converted the horse stables and the area underneath the grandstand into residential \"apartments\". Inmates began arriving in April, most coming from the surrounding Los Angeles County, and the center's population soon topped 18,000, peaking at 18,719 by August of that year. Six mess halls, each seating approximately 850 at a time, fed some 3,000 people daily at a cost of 33 cents per inmate. The sanitary facilities faced similar overcrowding, with a ratio of 30 inmates to each shower ''after'' the number of showers was increased from 150 to 225 in early July. Consequently, inmates spent a significant portion of their time in Santa Anita waiting in line for meals or to use the sanitary facilities.<ref name=Linke/>\n\nThe Assembly Center remained open for seven months, and in the meantime, inmates took up jobs in camp at the camouflage net factory, the hospital or various administrative departments, and set up schools to ensure their children's education would not be interrupted. Transfer to [[War Relocation Authority]] camps began on August 26, 1942, when 901 inmates left for [[Poston War Relocation Center|Poston]], Arizona, and over the next month the remaining Japanese Americans were sent to Poston and several other camps. The Santa Anita Assembly Center closed on October 27, 1942.<ref name=Linke/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/08/local/me-then8|title=Santa Anita racetrack played a role in WWII internment|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 8, 2009|first=Alison|last=Bell}}</ref>\n\n==Course attributes==\n[[Image:SantaAnitaTrackMtns wb.jpg|thumb|right|The Santa Anita track is set against the backdrop of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].]]Santa Anita has a one-mile (1,609 m) natural dirt main track which rings a turf course measuring 0.9 mile, or {{convert|1,584|yd|m}}. In addition, it has an unusual hillside turf course which crosses the dirt and is used mainly to run turf races at a distance of \"about\" 6\u00bd furlongs (exact distance is {{convert|1,408.5|yd|m}}). This type of track is one of the few of its kind in America.\n\nTo comply with a State of California mandate, Santa Anita replaced its dirt racing surface with a new synthetic surface called [[Synthetic racetrack surfaces for horse racing|Cushion Track]], a mixture of silica sand, synthetic fibers, elastic fiber, granulated rubber and a wax coating. The new Cushion Track opened for training on Sept 4, 2007 and hosted its first live race on Sept 26, 2007. The track lost 11 racing dates in 2008 due to a drainage problem with the new material, but intensive maintenance and the addition of a liquid binder greatly improved the artificial surface.  Santa Anita replaced the artificial surface with a return to an all natural dirt surface in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.santaanita.com/press/pressrelease/2010/12/santa-anita-main-track-reopens-training-natural-dirt-surface-withstands |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234615/http://www.santaanita.com/press/pressrelease/2010/12/santa-anita-main-track-reopens-training-natural-dirt-surface-withstands |archivedate=2011-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nSanta Anita occupies {{convert|320|acre|km2}}.

Phi Kappa Psi countered by noting that there had been no party held on the night of the alleged attack and no pledges resided in the house at that time of year. In response to those revelations, Jackie's father declared that Phi Kappa Psi had been misidentified and the attack had occurred at a different fraternity, though he did not elaborate as to which one. However, that statement seemed to contradict an earlier assertion the accuser had made to ''The Washington Post'', in which she stated: \"I know it was Phi [Kappa] Psi, because a year afterward, my friend pointed out the building to me.\"\n\nIn Erdely's story, Jackie disclosed to friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall the identity of her date to the fraternity party and said that he was the ringleader of the rape. Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.<ref name=\"wapo U-VA STUDENTS\" />\nJackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall had become suspicious as to whether Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person.

''The Washington Times'' determined \"Drew\"'s \"telephone\" and \"Blackberry\" numbers were in fact \"Internet phone numbers that enable the user to make calls or send SMS text messages to telephones from a computer or iPad while creating the appearance that they are coming from a real phone\". \"Drew\" eventually sent a photo of \"himself\" to Jackie's friends, but \"the man depicted in that photograph never attended U.

Phi Kappa Psi countered by noting that there had been no party held on the night of the alleged attack and no pledges resided in the house at that time of year. In response to those revelations, Jackie's father declared that Phi Kappa Psi had been misidentified and the attack had occurred at a different fraternity, though he did not elaborate as to which one. However, that statement seemed to contradict an earlier assertion the accuser had made to ''The Washington Post'', in which she stated: \"I know it was Phi [Kappa] Psi, because a year afterward, my friend pointed out the building to me.\"\n\nIn Erdely's story, Jackie disclosed to friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall the identity of her date to the fraternity party and said that he was the ringleader of the rape. Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.<ref name=\"wapo U-VA STUDENTS\" />\nJackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall had become suspicious as to whether Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that the owner of the phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.<ref>{{cite news |last=Byers |first=Dylan |date=December 10, 2014 |title=U-Va. students challenge Rolling Stone account of alleged sexual assault |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/12/more-problems-with-the-rolling-stone-piece-199821.html |newspaper=[[Politico]] |accessdate=December 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227035416/http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/12/more-problems-with-the-rolling-stone-piece-199821.html |archive-date=December 27, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite news|title='Catfishing' over love interest might have spurred U-Va. gang-rape debacle|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/01/08/catfishing-over-love-interest-might-have-spurred-u-va-gang-rape-debacle/|accessdate=November 5, 2016|work=Washington Post|date=January 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114231852/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/01/08/catfishing-over-love-interest-might-have-spurred-u-va-gang-rape-debacle/|archive-date=November 14, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}\n</ref>{{efn|The fact that Jackie had a romantic interest in Randall was also noted by other news media.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Happened to Jackie?

{"title_page": "Earthworm", "text_new": "{{pp-move-indef|small=yes}}\n[[File:Earthworm.JPG|thumb|An earthworm with a well-developed [[clitellum]]]]\n\nAn '''earthworm''' is a tubular, segmented [[worm]] of the phylum [[Annelid]]a. They occur worldwide and are commonly found in soil, eating live and dead organic matter. An earthworm's digestive system runs the length of its body. It respires through its skin. It has a double transport system made of [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] that moves within the fluid-filled [[coelom]] and a simple, closed circulatory system. It has a central and peripheral nervous system. Its central nervous system consists of two [[ganglia]] above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve running along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors concentrate near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles edging each segment let the worm move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move digesting food toward the worm's anus.<ref name=\"Integrated Principles of Zoology\">{{cite book|author=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr.|author2=Larry S. Roberts|author3=Frances M Hickman|title=Integrated Principles of Zoology|year=1984|edition=7th|publisher=Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing|isbn=978-0-8016-2173-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/integratedprinci7ed0hick/page/344 344]|url=https://archive.org/details/integratedprinci7ed0hick/page/344}}</ref>\n\nEarthworms are [[hermaphrodite]]s: each carries male and female sex organs. As invertebrates, they lack a true [[skeleton]], but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]].\n\n\"Earthworm\" is the common name for the largest members of [[Oligochaeta]] (which is a class or subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were in the order Opisthopora, since the male pores opened posterior to the female pores, although the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical [[Cladistics|cladistic]] studies have placed them in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include \"dew-worm\", \"rainworm\", \"nightcrawler\", and \"angleworm\" (from its use as [[fishing bait]]).\n\nLarger terrestrial earthworms are also called '''megadriles''' (translates to \"big worms\"), opposed to the microdriles (\"small worms\") in the semiaquatic families [[Tubificidae]], [[Lumbricidae]], and [[Enchytraeidae]]. The megadriles are characterized by a distinct [[clitellum]] (more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.\n\n== Anatomy ==\n=== Form and function ===\n[[File:Earthworm head.svg|450px|thumb|Earthworm head]]\nDepending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and over {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, but the typical ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' grows to about {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.{{sfn|Blakemore|2012|p=xl}} Probably the longest worm on confirmed records is ''[[Amynthas mekongianus]]'' that extends up to 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) <ref name =\"Blakemore et al., 2007 page 23\">{{cite web |author=R.J.

Furrows are generally{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=11}} externally visible on the body demarking the segments; dorsal pores and [[nephridiopore]]s exude a fluid that moistens and protects the worm's surface, allowing it to breathe.

The first body segment (segment number 1) features both the earthworm's mouth and, overhanging the mouth, a fleshy lobe called the [[prostomium]], which seals the entrance when the worm is at rest, but is also used to feel and chemically sense the worm's surroundings. Some species of earthworm can even use the prehensile prostomium to grab and drag items such as grasses and leaves into their burrow.\n\nAn adult earthworm develops a belt-shaped glandular swelling, called the [[clitellum]], which covers several segments toward the front part of the animal. This is part of the reproductive system and produces egg capsules. The [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] is most commonly cylindrical like the rest of the body, but depending on the species, it may also be quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or flattened. The last segment is called the [[periproct]]; the earthworm's anus, a short vertical slit, is found on this segment.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3\u20136}}\n\n[[File:Annelid redone w white background.svg|700px|center|A segment of an earthworm posterior to the clitellum including all of the segmental structures]]\n\nThe exterior of an individual segment is a thin [[cuticle]] over the skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through the soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles\u2014a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal muscle.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=8-9}} Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid-filled chamber called a [[coelom]]{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=1}} that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm's boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by septa (the plural of \"septum\"){{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=8}} which are perforated transverse walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}} A pair of structures called [[nephrostome]]s are located at the back of each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment. This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the [[nephridium]] or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm's sides; usually, two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=6}} At the centre of a worm is the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]], which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the dorsal blood vessel and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the [[ventral nerve cord]], and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood vessels.\n\nMany earthworms can eject coelomic fluid through pores in the back in response to stress; the Australian ''Didymogaster sylvaticus'' (known as the \"blue squirter earthworm\") can squirt fluid as high as {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name =\"Meet the squirting earthworm\">{{cite web |author=Myrmecofourmis |year=2018 |title=Meet the squirting earthworm |publisher=Youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuQEAuM9De8 |format=[[video]]|author-link=Myrmecofourmis }}</ref>{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}}\n\n=== Nervous system ===\n[[File:Earthworm nervous system.png|thumb|280px|Nervous system of the anterior end of an earthworm]]\n\n==== Central nervous system ====\nThe CNS consists of a bilobed [[brain]] (cerebral [[Ganglion|ganglia]], or supra-pharyngeal ganglion), sub-pharyngeal ganglia, circum-pharyngeal connectives and a [[ventral nerve cord]].\n\nEarthworms' brains consist of a pair of pear-shaped cerebral ganglia. These are located in the dorsal side of the alimentary canal in the third segment, in a groove between the [[buccal cavity]] and [[pharynx]].\n\nA pair of circum-pharyngeal connectives from the brain encircle the pharynx and then connect with a pair of sub-pharyngeal ganglia located below the pharynx in the fourth segment. This arrangement means the brain, sub-pharyngeal ganglia and the circum-pharyngeal connectives form a nerve ring around the pharynx.\n\nThe ventral nerve cord (formed by nerve cells and nerve fibres) begins at the sub-pharyngeal ganglia and extends below the alimentary canal to the most posterior body segment. The ventral nerve cord has a swelling, or ganglion, in each segment, i.e. a segmental ganglion, which occurs from the fifth to the last segment of the body. There is also three giant [[axon]]s, one medial giant axon (MGA) and two lateral giant axons (LGAs) on the mid-dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord. The MGA is 0.07&nbsp;mm in diameter and transmits in an anterior-posterior direction at a rate of 32.2&nbsp;m/s. The LGAs are slightly wider at 0.05&nbsp;mm in diameter and transmit in a posterior-anterior direction at 12.6&nbsp;m/s. The two LGAs are connected at regular intervals along the body and are therefore considered one giant axon.<ref name=\"expt\">{{cite web|url=https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/comparingNerveSpeed#prettyPhoto|title=Experiment: Comparing speeds of two nerve fiber sizes|publisher=BackyardBrains|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Drewes\">{{cite journal|title=Giant nerve fibre activity in intact, freely moving earthworms|author=Drewes, C.D., Landa, K.B. and McFall, J.L.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=72|pages=217\u2013227|year=1978|pmid=624897}}</ref>\n\n==== Peripheral nervous system ====\n*Eight to ten nerves arise from the cerebral ganglia to supply the [[prostomium]], buccal chamber and [[pharynx]].\n*Three pairs of nerves arise from the subpharyangeal ganglia to supply the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segment.\n*Three pairs of nerves extend from each [[segmental ganglion]] to supply various structures of the segment.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system consists of nerve plexuses in the epidermis and alimentary canal. (A plexus is a web of connected nerve cells.) The nerves that run along the body wall pass between the outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers of the wall. They give off branches that form the intermuscular plexus and the subepidermal plexus. These nerves connect with the cricopharyngeal connective.\n\n==== Movement ====\nOn the surface, crawling speed varies both within and among individuals. Earthworms crawl faster primarily by taking longer \"strides\" and a greater frequency of strides. Larger ''Lumbricus Terrestris'' worms crawl at a greater absolute speed than smaller worms. They achieve this by taking slightly longer strides but with slightly lower stride frequencies.<ref name=\"Quillin\">{{cite journal|title=Kinematic scaling of locomotion by hydrostatic animals: ontogeny of peristaltic crawling by the earthworm lumbricus terrestris|author=Quillin, K.J.|year=1999|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=202|pages=661\u2013674|pmid=10021320}}</ref>\n\nTouching an earthworm, which causes a \"pressure\" response as well as (often) a response to the dehydrating quality of the salt on human skin (toxic to earthworms), stimulates the subepidermal nerve plexus which connects to the intermuscular plexus and causes the longitudinal muscles to contract. This causes the writhing movements observed when a human picks up an earthworm. This behaviour is a [[reflex]] and does not require the CNS; it occurs even if the nerve cord is removed. Each segment of the earthworm has its own nerve plexus. The plexus of one segment is not connected directly to that of adjacent segments. The nerve cord is required to connect the nervous systems of the segments.<ref name=\"Cronodon\">{{cite web|publisher=Cronodon|title=Earthworm-nervous system|url=http://cronodon.com/BioTech/Earthworm_NS.html|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe giant axons carry the fastest signals along the nerve cord. These are emergency signals that initiate reflex escape behaviours. The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, from the rear to the front of the animal. If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract. This causes the worm to shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear. Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a bird).\n\nThe presence of a nervous system is essential for an animal to be able to experience [[nociception]] or [[Pain in invertebrates|pain]]. However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by analgesics.<ref name=\"Elwood\">{{Cite journal|journal=ILAR Journal|year=2011|volume=52|issue=2|pages=175\u201384|title=Pain and suffering in invertebrates?|author= Elwood, R.W.|pmid=21709310|doi=10.1093/ilar.52.2.175|doi-access=free}}</ref> [[Enkephalin]] and [[\u03b1-endorphin]]-like substances have been found in earthworms.

These photoreceptor cells have a central intracellular cavity ([[phaosome]]) filled with [[microvilli]]. As well as the microvilli, there are several sensory cilia in the phagosome which are structurally independent of the microvilli.<ref name=\"eyes\">{{cite journal|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie|year=1970|volume=104|issue=3|pages=345\u2013357|title=Fine structure of photoreceptor cells in the earthworm, ''Lumbricus Terrestris''|author=R\u00f6hlich, P., Aros, B. and Vir\u00e1gh, Sz.|doi=10.1007/BF00335687}}</ref> The photoreceptors are distributed in most parts of the epidermis but are more concentrated on the back and sides of the worm. A relatively small number occurs on the ventral surface of the 1st segment. They are most numerous in the prostomium and reduce in density in the first three segments; they are very few in number past the third segment.<ref name=\"Cronodon\" />\n\nEpidermal receptor (Sense organ)\n\nThese receptors are abundant and distributed all over the epidermis. Each receptor shows a slightly elevated cuticle which covers a group of tall, slender and columnar receptor cells. These cells bear small hairlike processes at their outer ends and their inner ends are connected with nerve fibres. The epidermal receptors are tactile in function. They are also concerned with changes in temperature and respond to chemical stimuli. Earthworms are extremely sensitive to touch and mechanical vibration.\n\nBuccal receptor (Sense organ)\n\nThese receptors are located only in the epithelium of the buccal chamber. These receptors are gustatory and olfactory (related to taste and smell). They also respond to chemical stimuli. (Chemoreceptor)\n\n=== Digestive system ===\nThe [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] of the earthworm is a straight tube which extends from the worm's mouth to its anus. It is differentiated into an alimentary canal and associated glands which are embedded in the wall of the alimentary canal itself. The alimentary canal consists of a mouth, buccal cavity (generally running through the first one or two segments of the earthworm), pharynx (running generally about four segments in length), oesophagus, crop, gizzard (usually) and intestine.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=13}}\n\nFood enters at the mouth. The pharynx acts as a suction pump; its muscular walls draw in food. In the pharynx, the pharyngeal glands secrete mucus. Food moves into the esophagus, where calcium (from the blood and ingested from previous meals) is pumped in to maintain proper blood calcium levels in the blood and food pH. From there the food passes into the crop and gizzard. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions grind the food with the help of mineral particles ingested along with the food. Once through the gizzard, food continues through the intestine for digestion. The intestine secretes [[pepsin]] to digest proteins, [[amylase]] to digest polysaccharides, [[cellulase]] to digest cellulose, and lipase to digest fats.<ref name=\"Integrated Principles of Zoology\" /> Earthworms use, in addition to the digestive proteins, a class of surface active compounds called [[drilodefensins]], which help digest plant material.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Unique metabolites protect earthworms against plant polyphenols|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2015-08-04|pmc = 4532835|pmid = 26241769|pages = 7869|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms8869|language = en|first = Manuel|last = Liebeke|first2 = Nicole|last2 = Strittmatter|first3 = Sarah|last3 = Fearn|first4 = A.

The intestine has its own pair of muscle layers like the body, but in reverse order\u2014an inner circular layer within an outer longitudinal layer.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|pp=13\u201315}}\n\n=== Circulatory system ===\nEarthworms have a dual circulatory system in which both the coelomic fluid and a closed circulatory system carry the food, waste, and respiratory gases. The closed circulatory system has five main blood vessels: the dorsal (top) vessel, which runs above the digestive tract; the ventral (bottom) vessel, which runs below the digestive tract; the subneural vessel, which runs below the ventral nerve cord; and two lateroneural vessels on either side of the nerve cord.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=10}}\n\nThe dorsal vessel is mainly a collecting structure in the intestinal region. It receives a pair commissural and dorsal intestines in each segment. \nThe ventral vessel branches off to a pair of ventro-tegumentaries and ventro-intestinals in each segment. The subneural vessel also gives out a pair of commissurals running along the posterior surface of the septum.\n\nThe pumping action on the dorsal vessel moves the blood forward, while the other four longitudinal vessels carry the blood rearward. In segments seven through eleven, a pair of aortic arches ring the coelom and acts as hearts, pumping the blood to the ventral vessel that acts as the aorta. The blood consists of ameboid cells and haemoglobin dissolved in the plasma. The second circulatory system derives from the cells of the digestive system that line the coelom. As the digestive cells become full, they release non-living cells of fat into the fluid-filled coelom, where they float freely but can pass through the walls separating each segment, moving food to other parts and assist in wound healing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cleveland P.

Gases are exchanged through the moist skin and capillaries, where the oxygen is picked up by the haemoglobin dissolved in the blood plasma and carbon dioxide is released. Water, as well as salts, can also be moved through the skin by active transport.\n\n== Life and physiology ==\nAt birth, earthworms emerge small but fully formed, lacking only their sex structures which develop in about 60 to 90 days. They attain full size in about one year.

Earthworms are [[hermaphrodite]]s; that is, they have both male and female sexual organs. The sexual organs are located in segments 9 to 15. Earthworms have one or two pairs of testes contained within sacs. The two or four pairs of [[seminal vesicle]]s produce, store and release the sperm via the male pores. Ovaries and oviducts in segment 13 release eggs via female pores on segment 14, while sperm is expelled from segment 15. One or more pairs of [[spermatheca]]e are present in segments 9 and 10 (depending on the species) which are internal sacs that receive and store sperm from the other worm during copulation.

The mating pair overlap front ends ventrally and each exchanges sperm with the other. The [[clitellum]] becomes very reddish to pinkish in colour. Sometime after copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm's sperm into it. As the worm slips out of the ring, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely onion-shaped incubator ([[Pupa|cocoon]]) in which the embryonic worms develop.\n\n=== Locomotion ===\n[[File:Close up of earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Close up of an earthworm in garden soil]]\nEarthworms travel underground by the means of waves of muscular contractions which alternately shorten and lengthen the body ([[peristalsis]]). The shortened part is anchored to the surrounding soil by tiny clawlike bristles ([[seta]]e) set along its segmented length. In all the body segments except the first, last and clitellum, there is a ring of S-shaped setae embedded in the epidermal pit of each segment (perichaetine). The whole burrowing process is aided by the secretion of lubricating mucus. As a result of their movement through their lubricated tunnels, worms can make gurgling noises underground when disturbed. Earthworms move through soil by expanding crevices with force; when forces are measured according to body weight, hatchlings can push 500 times their own body weight whereas large adults can push only 10 times their own body weight.<ref name=\"Quillan 2000\">{{cite journal|year=2000|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=203|issue=Pt 18|pages=2757\u20132770|author=Quillan, K.J.|title=Ontogenetic scaling of burrowing forces in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/18/2757.full.pdf+html|accessdate=April 4, 2015|pmid=10952876}}</ref>\n\n=== Regeneration ===\nEarthworms have the ability to regenerate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage. Stephenson (1930) devoted a chapter of his monograph to this topic, while G.E. Gates spent 20 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but \"because little interest was shown\", Gates (1972) published only a few of his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species.\n\nGates's reports included:\n*''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' <small>([[Marie Jules C\u00e9sar Savigny|Savigny]], 1826)</small> with head regeneration, in an anterior direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23/24, while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20/21, i.e., two worms may grow from one.<ref name=biolbull />\n*''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' <small>([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]])</small> replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13/14 and 16/17 but tail regeneration was never found.\n*''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'' <small>(Perrier, 1872)</small> readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far back as 17/18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as 20/21.\n*''[[Lampito mauritii]]'' <small>(Kinberg, 1867)</small> with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels back to 25/26 and tail regeneration from 30/31; head regeneration was sometimes believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from ''[[Sarcophaga]]'' sp. larval infestation.\n*''[[Criodrilus lacuum]]'' <small>(Hoffmeister, 1845)</small> also has prodigious regenerative capacity with 'head' regeneration from as far back as 40/41.<ref name=Hoffmeister />\n\nAn unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a replacement head has been reported.<ref name=secondhead />\n\n== Taxonomy and distribution ==\nWithin the world of taxonomy, the stable 'Classical System' of Michaelsen (1900) and Stephenson (1930) was gradually eroded by the controversy over how to classify earthworms, such that Fender and McKey-Fender (1990) went so far as to say, \"The family-level classification of the [[Megascolecidae|megascolecid]] earthworms is in chaos.\"<ref name=soilbio /> Over the years, many scientists have developed their own classification systems for earthworms, which led to confusion, and these systems have been and still continue to be revised and updated.

These are the peregrine or cosmopolitan earthworms.<ref name=cosmo3 />\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Earthworm - L. terrestris permanent vertical burrow.jpg|thumb|upright|Permanent vertical burrow]]\nEarthworms are classified into three main ecophysiological categories: (1) leaf litter- or compost-dwelling worms that are nonburrowing, live at the soil-litter interface and eat decomposing organic matter (called Epigeic) e.g. ''Eisenia fetida''; (2) topsoil- or subsoil-dwelling worms that feed (on soil), burrow and cast within the soil, creating horizontal burrows in upper 10\u201330&nbsp; cm of soil (called Endogeics); and (3) worms that construct permanent deep vertical burrows which they use to visit the surface to obtain plant material for food, such as leaves (Anecic, meaning \"reaching up\"), e.g. ''Lumbricus Terrestris''.<ref name=ucdavis />\n\nEarthworm populations depend on both physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, salts, [[aeration]], and texture, as well as available food, and the ability of the species to reproduce and disperse. One of the most important environmental factors is [[pH]], but earthworms vary in their preferences. Most favour neutral to slightly acidic soils. ''Lumbricus Terrestris'' is still present in a pH of 5.4, ''[[Dendrobaena octaedra]]'' at a pH of 4.3 and some [[Megascolecidae]] are present in extremely acidic humic soils. Soil pH may also influence the numbers of worms that go into [[diapause]]. The more acidic the soil, the sooner worms go into diapause and the longer they remain in diapause at a pH of 6.4.\n\nEarthworms are preyed upon by many species of [[bird]]s (e.g. [[starling]]s, [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s), snakes, mammals (e.g. [[bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[hedgehog]]s, [[pig]]s, [[mole (animal)|moles]]) and invertebrates (e.g. [[ground beetle]]s and other [[beetle]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s). Earthworms have many internal [[parasite]]s, including [[protozoa]], platyhelminthes, and [[nematode]]s; they can be found in the worms' [[blood]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[coelom]], or [[intestine]], or in their [[Pupa|cocoons]].\n\nNitrogenous fertilizers tend to create [[Soil pH|acidic conditions]], which are fatal to the worms, and dead specimens are often found on the surface following the application of substances such as [[DDT]], [[lime sulphur]], and [[lead arsenate]]. In [[Australia]], changes in farming practices such as the application of [[superphosphate]]s on [[pasture]]s and a switch from [[pastoral farming]] to [[Agronomy|arable farming]] had a devastating effect on populations of the giant [[Gippsland earthworm]], leading to their classification as a [[protected species]]. Globally, certain earthworms populations have been devastated by deviation from organic production and the spraying of synthetic fertilizers and biocides, with at least three species now listed as extinct but many more endangered.<ref name=blakemore2018>{{cite journal | title=Critical Decline of Earthworms from Organic Origins under Intensive, Humic SOM-Depleting Agriculture  | journal=Soil Systems  | volume=2  | issue=2  | pages=33  | publisher=Soil Systems 2(2): 33 | doi=10.3390/soilsystems2020033 | author=Blakemore, R.J.

Certain species of earthworm come to the surface and graze on the higher concentrations of organic matter present there, mixing it with the mineral soil.

This is achieved by the worm's actions of pulling below the surface deposited organic matter such as leaf fall or manure, either for food or to plug its burrow. Once in the burrow, the worm will shred the leaf, partially digest it and mingle it with the earth. Worm casts (see bottom right) can contain 40 per cent more humus than the top 9\" (23&nbsp;cm) of soil in which the worm is living.<ref name=\"brady\">{{cite book|author1=Nyle C.

When the worm excretes this in the form of casts, deposited on the surface or deeper in the soil, minerals and plant nutrients are changed to an accessible form for plants to use. Investigations in the United States show that fresh earthworm casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s, and 11 times richer in available [[potassium]] than the surrounding upper 6&nbsp;inches (150&nbsp;mm) of soil.

[[Permaculture]] co-founder [[Bill Mollison]] points out that by sliding in their tunnels, earthworms \"act as an innumerable army of pistons pumping air in and out of the soils on a 24-hour cycle (more rapidly at night)\".<ref name=Mollison /> Thus, the earthworm not only creates passages for air and water to traverse the soil, but also modifies the vital organic component that makes a soil healthy (see [[Bioturbation]]). Earthworms promote the formation of nutrient-rich casts (globules of soil, stable in soil mucus) that have high soil aggregation and soil fertility and quality.<ref name=\"brady\" />  In [[podzol]] soils, earthworms can obliterate the characteristic banded appearance of the soil profile by mixing the organic (LFH), eluvial (E) and upper illuvial (B) horizons to create a single dark Ap horizon.<ref>\n https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/sites/harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/files/publications/pdfs/Fisher_Ecology_1928.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.4141/cjss64-005 Some Effects of Earthworm Invasion in Virgin Podzols</ref>\n\nEarthworms accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system through fragmentation & mixing of plant debris \u2013 physical grinding & chemical digestion.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The earthworm's existence cannot be taken for granted.

They occur worldwide and are commonly found in soil, eating live and dead organic matter. An earthworm's digestive system runs the length of its body. It respires through its skin. It has a double transport system made of [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] that moves within the fluid-filled [[coelom]] and a simple, closed circulatory system. It has a central and peripheral nervous system. Its central nervous system consists of two [[ganglia]] above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve running along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors concentrate near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles edging each segment let the worm move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move digesting food toward the worm's anus.<ref name=\"Integrated Principles of Zoology\">{{cite book|author=Cleveland P.

As invertebrates, they lack a true [[skeleton]], but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]].\n\n\"Earthworm\" is the common name for the largest members of [[Oligochaeta]] (which is a class or subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were in the order Opisthopora, since the male pores opened posterior to the female pores, although the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical [[Cladistics|cladistic]] studies have placed them in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include \"dew-worm\", \"rainworm\", \"nightcrawler\", and \"angleworm\" (from its use as [[fishing bait]]).\n\nLarger terrestrial earthworms are also called '''megadriles''' (translates to \"big worms\"), opposed to the microdriles (\"small worms\") in the semiaquatic families [[Tubificidae]], [[Lumbricidae]], and [[Enchytraeidae]]. The megadriles are characterized by a distinct [[clitellum]] (more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.\n\n== Anatomy ==\n=== Form and function ===\n[[File:Earthworm head.svg|450px|thumb|Earthworm head]]\nDepending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and over {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, but the typical ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' grows to about {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.{{sfn|Blakemore|2012|p=xl}} Probably the longest worm on confirmed records is ''[[Amynthas mekongianus]]'' that extends up to 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) <ref name =\"Blakemore et al., 2007 page 23\">{{cite web |author=R.J.

The first body segment (segment number 1) features both the earthworm's mouth and, overhanging the mouth, a fleshy lobe called the [[prostomium]], which seals the entrance when the worm is at rest, but is also used to feel and chemically sense the worm's surroundings. Some species of earthworm can even use the prehensile prostomium to grab and drag items such as grasses and leaves into their burrow.\n\nAn adult earthworm develops a belt-shaped glandular swelling, called the [[clitellum]], which covers several segments toward the front part of the animal. This is part of the reproductive system and produces egg capsules. The [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] is most commonly cylindrical like the rest of the body, but depending on the species, it may also be quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or flattened. The last segment is called the [[periproct]]; the earthworm's anus, a short vertical slit, is found on this segment.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3\u20136}}\n\n[[File:Annelid redone w white background.svg|700px|center|A segment of an earthworm posterior to the clitellum including all of the segmental structures]]\n\nThe exterior of an individual segment is a thin [[cuticle]] over the skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through the soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles\u2014a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal muscle.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=8-9}} Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid-filled chamber called a [[coelom]]{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=1}} that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm's boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by septa (the plural of \"septum\"){{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=8}} which are perforated transverse walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}} A pair of structures called [[nephrostome]]s are located at the back of each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment. This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the [[nephridium]] or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm's sides; usually, two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=6}} At the centre of a worm is the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]], which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the dorsal blood vessel and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the [[ventral nerve cord]], and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood vessels.\n\nMany earthworms can eject coelomic fluid through pores in the back in response to stress; the Australian ''Didymogaster sylvaticus'' (known as the \"blue squirter earthworm\") can squirt fluid as high as {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name =\"Meet the squirting earthworm\">{{cite web |author=Myrmecofourmis |year=2018 |title=Meet the squirting earthworm |publisher=Youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuQEAuM9De8 |format=[[video]]|author-link=Myrmecofourmis }}</ref>{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}}\n\n=== Nervous system ===\n[[File:Earthworm nervous system.png|thumb|280px|Nervous system of the anterior end of an earthworm]]\n\n==== Central nervous system ====\nThe CNS consists of a bilobed [[brain]] (cerebral [[Ganglion|ganglia]], or supra-pharyngeal ganglion), sub-pharyngeal ganglia, circum-pharyngeal connectives and a [[ventral nerve cord]].\n\nEarthworms' brains consist of a pair of pear-shaped cerebral ganglia. These are located in the dorsal side of the alimentary canal in the third segment, in a groove between the [[buccal cavity]] and [[pharynx]].\n\nA pair of circum-pharyngeal connectives from the brain encircle the pharynx and then connect with a pair of sub-pharyngeal ganglia located below the pharynx in the fourth segment. This arrangement means the brain, sub-pharyngeal ganglia and the circum-pharyngeal connectives form a nerve ring around the pharynx.\n\nThe ventral nerve cord (formed by nerve cells and nerve fibres) begins at the sub-pharyngeal ganglia and extends below the alimentary canal to the most posterior body segment. The ventral nerve cord has a swelling, or ganglion, in each segment, i.e. a segmental ganglion, which occurs from the fifth to the last segment of the body. There is also three giant [[axon]]s, one medial giant axon (MGA) and two lateral giant axons (LGAs) on the mid-dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord. The MGA is 0.07&nbsp;mm in diameter and transmits in an anterior-posterior direction at a rate of 32.2&nbsp;m/s. The LGAs are slightly wider at 0.05&nbsp;mm in diameter and transmit in a posterior-anterior direction at 12.6&nbsp;m/s. The two LGAs are connected at regular intervals along the body and are therefore considered one giant axon.<ref name=\"expt\">{{cite web|url=https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/comparingNerveSpeed#prettyPhoto|title=Experiment: Comparing speeds of two nerve fiber sizes|publisher=BackyardBrains|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Drewes\">{{cite journal|title=Giant nerve fibre activity in intact, freely moving earthworms|author=Drewes, C.D., Landa, K.B. and McFall, J.L.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=72|pages=217\u2013227|year=1978|pmid=624897}}</ref>\n\n==== Peripheral nervous system ====\n*Eight to ten nerves arise from the cerebral ganglia to supply the [[prostomium]], buccal chamber and [[pharynx]].\n*Three pairs of nerves arise from the subpharyangeal ganglia to supply the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segment.\n*Three pairs of nerves extend from each [[segmental ganglion]] to supply various structures of the segment.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system consists of nerve plexuses in the epidermis and alimentary canal. (A plexus is a web of connected nerve cells.) The nerves that run along the body wall pass between the outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers of the wall. They give off branches that form the intermuscular plexus and the subepidermal plexus. These nerves connect with the cricopharyngeal connective.\n\n==== Movement ====\nOn the surface, crawling speed varies both within and among individuals. Earthworms crawl faster primarily by taking longer \"strides\" and a greater frequency of strides. Larger ''Lumbricus Terrestris'' worms crawl at a greater absolute speed than smaller worms. They achieve this by taking slightly longer strides but with slightly lower stride frequencies.<ref name=\"Quillin\">{{cite journal|title=Kinematic scaling of locomotion by hydrostatic animals: ontogeny of peristaltic crawling by the earthworm lumbricus terrestris|author=Quillin, K.J.|year=1999|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=202|pages=661\u2013674|pmid=10021320}}</ref>\n\nTouching an earthworm, which causes a \"pressure\" response as well as (often) a response to the dehydrating quality of the salt on human skin (toxic to earthworms), stimulates the subepidermal nerve plexus which connects to the intermuscular plexus and causes the longitudinal muscles to contract. This causes the writhing movements observed when a human picks up an earthworm. This behaviour is a [[reflex]] and does not require the CNS; it occurs even if the nerve cord is removed. Each segment of the earthworm has its own nerve plexus. The plexus of one segment is not connected directly to that of adjacent segments. The nerve cord is required to connect the nervous systems of the segments.<ref name=\"Cronodon\">{{cite web|publisher=Cronodon|title=Earthworm-nervous system|url=http://cronodon.com/BioTech/Earthworm_NS.html|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe giant axons carry the fastest signals along the nerve cord. These are emergency signals that initiate reflex escape behaviours. The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, from the rear to the front of the animal. If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract. This causes the worm to shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear. Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a bird).\n\nThe presence of a nervous system is essential for an animal to be able to experience [[nociception]] or [[Pain in invertebrates|pain]]. However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by analgesics.<ref name=\"Elwood\">{{Cite journal|journal=ILAR Journal|year=2011|volume=52|issue=2|pages=175\u201384|title=Pain and suffering in invertebrates?|author= Elwood, R.W.|pmid=21709310|doi=10.1093/ilar.52.2.175|doi-access=free}}</ref> [[Enkephalin]] and [[\u03b1-endorphin]]-like substances have been found in earthworms.

These photoreceptor cells have a central intracellular cavity ([[phaosome]]) filled with [[microvilli]]. As well as the microvilli, there are several sensory cilia in the phagosome which are structurally independent of the microvilli.<ref name=\"eyes\">{{cite journal|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie|year=1970|volume=104|issue=3|pages=345\u2013357|title=Fine structure of photoreceptor cells in the earthworm, ''Lumbricus Terrestris''|author=R\u00f6hlich, P., Aros, B. and Vir\u00e1gh, Sz.|doi=10.1007/BF00335687}}</ref> The photoreceptors are distributed in most parts of the epidermis but are more concentrated on the back and sides of the worm. A relatively small number occurs on the ventral surface of the 1st segment. They are most numerous in the prostomium and reduce in density in the first three segments; they are very few in number past the third segment.<ref name=\"Cronodon\" />\n\nEpidermal receptor (Sense organ)\n\nThese receptors are abundant and distributed all over the epidermis. Each receptor shows a slightly elevated cuticle which covers a group of tall, slender and columnar receptor cells. These cells bear small hairlike processes at their outer ends and their inner ends are connected with nerve fibres. The epidermal receptors are tactile in function. They are also concerned with changes in temperature and respond to chemical stimuli. Earthworms are extremely sensitive to touch and mechanical vibration.\n\nBuccal receptor (Sense organ)\n\nThese receptors are located only in the epithelium of the buccal chamber. These receptors are gustatory and olfactory (related to taste and smell). They also respond to chemical stimuli. (Chemoreceptor)\n\n=== Digestive system ===\nThe [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] of the earthworm is a straight tube which extends from the worm's mouth to its anus. It is differentiated into an alimentary canal and associated glands which are embedded in the wall of the alimentary canal itself. The alimentary canal consists of a mouth, buccal cavity (generally running through the first one or two segments of the earthworm), pharynx (running generally about four segments in length), oesophagus, crop, gizzard (usually) and intestine.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=13}}\n\nFood enters at the mouth. The pharynx acts as a suction pump; its muscular walls draw in food. In the pharynx, the pharyngeal glands secrete mucus. Food moves into the esophagus, where calcium (from the blood and ingested from previous meals) is pumped in to maintain proper blood calcium levels in the blood and food pH. From there the food passes into the crop and gizzard. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions grind the food with the help of mineral particles ingested along with the food. Once through the gizzard, food continues through the intestine for digestion. The intestine secretes [[Pepsin]] to digest proteins, [[Amylase]] to digest polysaccharides, [[Cellulase]] to digest cellulose, and lipase to digest fats.<ref name=\"Integrated Principles of Zoology\" /> Earthworms use, in addition to the digestive proteins, a class of surface active compounds called [[drilodefensins]], which help digest plant material.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Unique metabolites protect earthworms against plant polyphenols|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2015-08-04|pmc = 4532835|pmid = 26241769|pages = 7869|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms8869|language = en|first = Manuel|last = Liebeke|first2 = Nicole|last2 = Strittmatter|first3 = Sarah|last3 = Fearn|first4 = A.

The intestine has its own pair of muscle layers like the body, but in reverse order\u2014an inner circular layer within an outer longitudinal layer.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|pp=13\u201315}}\n\n=== Circulatory system ===\nEarthworms have a dual circulatory system in which both the coelomic fluid and a closed circulatory system carry the food, waste, and respiratory gases. The closed circulatory system has five main blood vessels: the dorsal (top) vessel, which runs above the digestive tract; the ventral (bottom) vessel, which runs below the digestive tract; the subneural vessel, which runs below the ventral nerve cord; and two lateroneural vessels on either side of the nerve cord.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=10}}\n\nThe dorsal vessel is mainly a collecting structure in the intestinal region. It receives a pair commissural and dorsal intestines in each segment. \nThe ventral vessel branches off to a pair of ventro-tegumentaries and ventro-intestinals in each segment. The subneural vessel also gives out a pair of commissurals running along the posterior surface of the septum.\n\nThe pumping action on the dorsal vessel moves the blood forward, while the other four longitudinal vessels carry the blood rearward. In segments seven through eleven, a pair of aortic arches ring the coelom and acts as hearts, pumping the blood to the ventral vessel that acts as the aorta. The blood consists of ameboid cells and haemoglobin dissolved in the plasma. The second circulatory system derives from the cells of the digestive system that line the coelom. As the digestive cells become full, they release non-living cells of fat into the fluid-filled coelom, where they float freely but can pass through the walls separating each segment, moving food to other parts and assist in wound healing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cleveland P.

Gases are exchanged through the moist skin and capillaries, where the oxygen is picked up by the haemoglobin dissolved in the blood plasma and carbon dioxide is released. Water, as well as salts, can also be moved through the skin by active transport.\n\n== Life and physiology ==\nAt birth, earthworms emerge small but fully formed, lacking only their sex structures which develop in about 60 to 90 days.

Earthworms are [[hermaphrodite]]s; that is, they have both male and female sexual organs. The sexual organs are located in segments 9 to 15. Earthworms have one or two pairs of testes contained within sacs. The two or four pairs of [[seminal vesicle]]s produce, store and release the sperm via the male pores. Ovaries and oviducts in segment 13 release eggs via female pores on segment 14, while sperm is expelled from segment 15. One or more pairs of [[spermatheca]]e are present in segments 9 and 10 (depending on the species) which are internal sacs that receive and store sperm from the other worm during copulation.

The mating pair overlap front ends ventrally and each exchanges sperm with the other. The [[clitellum]] becomes very reddish to pinkish in colour. Sometime after copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm's sperm into it. As the worm slips out of the ring, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely onion-shaped incubator ([[Pupa|cocoon]]) in which the embryonic worms develop.\n\n=== Locomotion ===\n[[File:Close up of earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Close up of an earthworm in garden soil]]\nEarthworms travel underground by the means of waves of muscular contractions which alternately shorten and lengthen the body ([[peristalsis]]). The shortened part is anchored to the surrounding soil by tiny clawlike bristles ([[seta]]e) set along its segmented length. In all the body segments except the first, last and clitellum, there is a ring of S-shaped setae embedded in the epidermal pit of each segment (perichaetine). The whole burrowing process is aided by the secretion of lubricating mucus. As a result of their movement through their lubricated tunnels, worms can make gurgling noises underground when disturbed. Earthworms move through soil by expanding crevices with force; when forces are measured according to body weight, hatchlings can push 500 times their own body weight whereas large adults can push only 10 times their own body weight.<ref name=\"Quillan 2000\">{{cite journal|year=2000|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=203|issue=Pt 18|pages=2757\u20132770|author=Quillan, K.J.|title=Ontogenetic scaling of burrowing forces in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/18/2757.full.pdf+html|accessdate=April 4, 2015|pmid=10952876}}</ref>\n\n=== Regeneration ===\nEarthworms have the ability to regenerate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage.

Gates spent 20 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but \"because little interest was shown\", Gates (1972) published only a few of his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species.\n\nGates's reports included:\n*''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' <small>([[Marie Jules C\u00e9sar Savigny|Savigny]], 1826)</small> with head regeneration, in an anterior direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23/24, while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20/21, i.e., two worms may grow from one.<ref name=biolbull />\n*''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' <small>([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]])</small> replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13/14 and 16/17 but tail regeneration was never found.\n*''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'' <small>(Perrier, 1872)</small> readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far back as 17/18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as 20/21.\n*''[[Lampito mauritii]]'' <small>(Kinberg, 1867)</small> with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels back to 25/26 and tail regeneration from 30/31; head regeneration was sometimes believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from ''[[Sarcophaga]]'' sp. larval infestation.\n*''[[Criodrilus lacuum]]'' <small>(Hoffmeister, 1845)</small> also has prodigious regenerative capacity with 'head' regeneration from as far back as 40/41.<ref name=Hoffmeister />\n\nAn unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a replacement head has been reported.<ref name=secondhead />\n\n== Taxonomy and distribution ==\nWithin the world of taxonomy, the stable 'Classical System' of Michaelsen (1900) and Stephenson (1930) was gradually eroded by the controversy over how to classify earthworms, such that Fender and McKey-Fender (1990) went so far as to say, \"The family-level classification of the [[Megascolecidae|megascolecid]] earthworms is in chaos.\"<ref name=soilbio /> Over the years, many scientists have developed their own classification systems for earthworms, which led to confusion, and these systems have been and still continue to be revised and updated.

These are the peregrine or cosmopolitan earthworms.<ref name=cosmo3 />\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Earthworm - L. terrestris permanent vertical burrow.jpg|thumb|upright|Permanent vertical burrow]]\nEarthworms are classified into three main ecophysiological categories: (1) leaf litter- or compost-dwelling worms that are nonburrowing, live at the soil-litter interface and eat decomposing organic matter (called Epigeic) e.g. ''Eisenia fetida''; (2) topsoil- or subsoil-dwelling worms that feed (on soil), burrow and cast within the soil, creating horizontal burrows in upper 10\u201330&nbsp; cm of soil (called Endogeics); and (3) worms that construct permanent deep vertical burrows which they use to visit the surface to obtain plant material for food, such as leaves (Anecic, meaning \"reaching up\"), e.g. ''Lumbricus Terrestris''.<ref name=ucdavis />\n\nEarthworm populations depend on both physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, salts, [[aeration]], and texture, as well as available food, and the ability of the species to reproduce and disperse. One of the most important environmental factors is [[pH]], but earthworms vary in their preferences. Most favour neutral to slightly acidic soils. ''Lumbricus Terrestris'' is still present in a pH of 5.4, ''[[Dendrobaena octaedra]]'' at a pH of 4.3 and some [[Megascolecidae]] are present in extremely acidic humic soils. Soil pH may also influence the numbers of worms that go into [[diapause]]. The more acidic the soil, the sooner worms go into diapause and the longer they remain in diapause at a pH of 6.4.\n\nEarthworms are preyed upon by many species of [[bird]]s (e.g. [[starling]]s, [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s), snakes, mammals (e.g. [[bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[hedgehog]]s, [[pig]]s, [[mole (animal)|moles]]) and invertebrates (e.g. [[ground beetle]]s and other [[beetle]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s). Earthworms have many internal [[parasite]]s, including [[protozoa]], platyhelminthes, and [[nematode]]s; they can be found in the worms' [[blood]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[coelom]], or [[intestine]], or in their [[Pupa|cocoons]].\n\nNitrogenous fertilizers tend to create [[Soil pH|acidic conditions]], which are fatal to the worms, and dead specimens are often found on the surface following the application of substances such as [[DDT]], [[lime sulphur]], and [[lead arsenate]]. In [[Australia]], changes in farming practices such as the application of [[superphosphate]]s on [[pasture]]s and a switch from [[pastoral farming]] to [[Agronomy|arable farming]] had a devastating effect on populations of the giant [[Gippsland earthworm]], leading to their classification as a [[protected species]]. Globally, certain earthworms populations have been devastated by deviation from organic production and the spraying of synthetic fertilizers and biocides, with at least three species now listed as extinct but many more endangered.<ref name=blakemore2018>{{cite journal | title=Critical Decline of Earthworms from Organic Origins under Intensive, Humic SOM-Depleting Agriculture  | journal=Soil Systems  | volume=2  | issue=2  | pages=33  | publisher=Soil Systems 2(2): 33 | doi=10.3390/soilsystems2020033 | author=Blakemore, R.J.

Certain species of earthworm come to the surface and graze on the higher concentrations of organic matter present there, mixing it with the mineral soil. Because a high level of organic matter mixing is associated with [[soil fertility]], an abundance of earthworms is generally considered beneficial by farmers and gardeners.<ref name=dpi>NSW Department of Primary Industries, [http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/soils/biology/earthworms How earthworms can help your soil]</ref><ref name=aggie>Galveston County Master Gardener Association, [http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/galveston/beneficials/beneficial-38_earthworms.htm Beneficials in the garden: #38 Earthworms]</ref> As long ago as 1881 [[Charles Darwin]] wrote: \"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures.\"<ref name=darwin />\n\n[[File:Staphylinus.olens.vs.lumbricus.terrestris.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Devil's coach horse beetle]]'' preying on ''Lumbricus'' sp.]]\nAlso, while, as the name suggests, the main habitat of earthworms is in soil, they are not restricted to this habitat. The brandling worm ''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' lives in decaying plant matter and manure. ''[[Arctiostrotus vancouverensis]]'' from [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] is generally found in decaying conifer logs. ''[[Aporrectodea limicola]]'', ''[[Sparganophilus]]'' spp.,  and several others are found in mud in streams.  Some species are arboreal, some aquatic and some euryhaline (salt-water tolerant) and littoral (living on the sea-shore, e.g. ''[[Pontodrilus litoralis]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240435104 | title=Origin and means of dispersal of cosmopolitan ''Pontodrilus litoralis'' (Oligochaeta: Megascolecidae) | publisher=European Journal of Soil Biology| author=Blakemore, R.J.

This is achieved by the worm's actions of pulling below the surface deposited organic matter such as leaf fall or manure, either for food or to plug its burrow. Once in the burrow, the worm will shred the leaf, partially digest it and mingle it with the earth. Worm casts (see bottom right) can contain 40 per cent more humus than the top 9\" (23&nbsp;cm) of soil in which the worm is living.<ref name=\"brady\">{{cite book|author1=Nyle C.

When the worm excretes this in the form of casts, deposited on the surface or deeper in the soil, minerals and plant nutrients are changed to an accessible form for plants to use. Investigations in the United States show that fresh earthworm casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s, and 11 times richer in available [[potassium]] than the surrounding upper 6&nbsp;inches (150&nbsp;mm) of soil. In conditions where humus is plentiful, the weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&nbsp;kg (10&nbsp;lb) per worm per year<!-- subjective , and is in itself an indicator of why it pays the gardener or farmer to keep worm populations high-->.<ref name=\"brady\" />\n* '''Physical''': The earthworm's burrowing creates a multitude of channels through the soil and is of great value in maintaining the [[soil structure]], enabling processes of aeration and drainage. [[Permaculture]] co-founder [[Bill Mollison]] points out that by sliding in their tunnels, earthworms \"act as an innumerable army of pistons pumping air in and out of the soils on a 24-hour cycle (more rapidly at night)\".<ref name=Mollison /> Thus, the earthworm not only creates passages for air and water to traverse the soil, but also modifies the vital organic component that makes a soil healthy (see [[Bioturbation]]). Earthworms promote the formation of nutrient-rich casts (globules of soil, stable in soil mucus) that have high soil aggregation and soil fertility and quality.<ref name=\"brady\" />  In [[podzol]] soils, earthworms can obliterate the characteristic banded appearance of the soil profile by mixing the organic (LFH), eluvial (E) and upper illuvial (B) horizons to create a single dark Ap horizon.<ref>\n https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/sites/harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/files/publications/pdfs/Fisher_Ecology_1928.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.4141/cjss64-005 Some Effects of Earthworm Invasion in Virgin Podzols</ref>\n\nEarthworms accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system through fragmentation & mixing of plant debris \u2013 physical grinding & chemical digestion.<ref name=\"brady\" /> The earthworm's existence cannot be taken for granted.

The main route climbs through what is now the '''[[Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park]]''', with a branch in Chatsworth Park South.\n\nIt was an important artery linking the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and inland [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] and as such, was part of the main route for travel by [[stagecoach]] between Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1861 until the opening of rail traffic between the cities in 1876.  The Old Santa Susana Stage Road is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Part of the stage road is also a Historic-Cultural Monument of Ventura County and of the City of Los Angeles under the name '''Old Stagecoach Trail'''.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1859, the California Legislature appropriated $15,000 for improving an old wagon road through the Santa Susana Pass. Additional funding was provided by the Counties of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. The outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861 disrupted mail service along the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]]'s southern stagecoach route from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] via [[El Paso]], [[Fort Yuma]] and [[Los Angeles]] and on to [[San Francisco]] via the [[Tejon Pass]], which had begun its run in 1858. To compensate, the government contracted the Butterfield Company to carry mail between Los Angeles and San Francisco via the new wagon road over the Santa Susana Pass.  The first overland mail stage run through the pass took place on April 6, 1861.<ref name=\"SSP\">{{cite book|last=Bevill|first=Arthur D.|title=Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park Cultural Resource Survey Historic Overview|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20historic%20resources.pdf|year=2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027094208/http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20historic%20resources.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref name=\"WTC\">[http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGS360-280 Old Stagecoach Trail at ''www.trails.com'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Link, Tom: ''Universal City - North Hollywood, a Centenniel Portrait'', Windsor Publications, 1991, {{ISBN|0-89781-393-6}}, p. 25</ref>  The new route diverged from the Tejon Pass route at the north end of the [[Cahuenga Pass]], following the old coast road (''El camino Viejo'', the former [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] to [[Ventura, California|San Buenaventura (Ventura)]] and Santa Barbara)  as far as the [[Rancho Los Encinos]] before striking northwest across the San Fernando Valley toward the Santa Susana Pass.<ref name=\"SSP\" /><ref>The stagecoach routes can clearly be seen on period maps.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stage Route Rancho Encino to Santa Susana Pass Hall Map 1880.png|left|thumb|200px|1880 manuscript map of the western San Fernando Valley, with the stage route from Rancho Los Encinos to Santa Susana Pass (upper left) highlighted.]]\nThe precipitous portion of the route on the San Fernando Valley side was called the Devil's Slide; horses were usually blindfolded and chains were used to augment brakes on the steep descent. Passengers debarked and walked.<ref name=\"SSP\" />\n\nThe [[Santa Susana Pass]] stagecoach road continued in use as an alternative to the route along El Camino Viejo from 1861 to 1875, replacing the older road as the main route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. William E. Lovett acquired the mail contract in 1867 and carried mail and passengers via the Santa Susana Pass and between Los Angeles and [[San Diego]]. In 1876, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] opened a tunnel through the [[Newhall Pass]], enabling rail connections from Los Angeles north to San Francisco, and rail travel soon replaced travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From this time the stagecoach traffic to Santa Barbara once again used the coast route, and the road through Santa Susana Pass was relegated to local traffic.<ref name=\"SSP\" />\n\nA new wagon route bypassing the deteriorating Devil's Slide was opened in 1895.  Initially called ''El Camino Nuevo'' (the New Road), it was later named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until the present ''Santa Susana Pass Road'' was built in 1917.<ref name=\"SSP\" /><ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/CA-118,+California/@34.2640037,-118.6355407,1328m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80e82ec1488c91cf:0x8ed449a82307d8a5?hl=en \"Santa Susana Pass Road\"].

The main route climbs through what is now the '''[[Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park]]''', with a branch in Chatsworth Park South.\n\nIt was an important artery linking the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and inland [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] and as such, was part of the main route for travel by [[stagecoach]] between Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1861 until the opening of rail traffic between the cities in 1876.  The Old Santa Susana Stage Road is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Part of the stage road is also a Historic-Cultural Monument of Ventura County and of the City of Los Angeles under the name '''Old Stagecoach Trail'''.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1859, the California Legislature appropriated $15,000 for improving an old wagon road through the Santa Susana Pass. Additional funding was provided by the Counties of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. The outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861 disrupted mail service along the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]]'s southern stagecoach route from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] via [[El Paso]], [[Fort Yuma]] and [[Los Angeles]] and on to [[San Francisco]] via the [[Tejon Pass]], which had begun its run in 1858. To compensate, the government contracted the Butterfield Company to carry mail between Los Angeles and San Francisco via the new wagon road over the Santa Susana Pass.  The first overland mail stage run through the pass took place on April 6, 1861.<ref name=\"SSP\">{{cite book|last=Bevill|first=Arthur D.|title=Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park Cultural Resource Survey Historic Overview|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20historic%20resources.pdf|year=2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027094208/http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20historic%20resources.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref name=\"WTC\">[http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGS360-280 Old Stagecoach Trail at ''www.trails.com'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Link, Tom: ''Universal City - North Hollywood, a Centenniel Portrait'', Windsor Publications, 1991, {{ISBN|0-89781-393-6}}, p. 25</ref>  The new route diverged from the Tejon Pass route at the north end of the [[Cahuenga Pass]], following the old coast road (''El camino Viejo'', the former [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] to [[Ventura, California|San Buenaventura (Ventura)]] and Santa Barbara)  as far as the [[Rancho Los Encinos]] before striking northwest across the San Fernando Valley toward the Santa Susana Pass.<ref name=\"SSP\" /><ref>The stagecoach routes can clearly be seen on period maps.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stage Route Rancho Encino to Santa Susana Pass Hall Map 1880.png|left|thumb|200px|1880 manuscript map of the western San Fernando Valley, with the stage route from Rancho Los Encinos to Santa Susana Pass (upper left) highlighted.]]\nThe precipitous portion of the route on the San Fernando Valley side was called the Devil's Slide; horses were usually blindfolded and chains were used to augment brakes on the steep descent. Passengers debarked and walked.<ref name=\"SSP\" />\n\nThe [[Santa Susana Pass]] stagecoach road continued in use as an alternative to the route along El Camino Viejo from 1861 to 1875, replacing the older road as the main route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. William E. Lovett acquired the mail contract in 1867 and carried mail and passengers via the Santa Susana Pass and between Los Angeles and [[San Diego]]. In 1876, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] opened a tunnel through the [[Newhall Pass]], enabling rail connections from Los Angeles north to San Francisco, and rail travel soon replaced travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From this time the stagecoach traffic to Santa Barbara once again used the coast route, and the road through Santa Susana Pass was relegated to local traffic.<ref name=\"SSP\" />\n\nA new wagon route bypassing the deteriorating Devil's Slide was opened in 1895.  Initially called ''El Camino Nuevo'' (the New Road), it was later named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until the present ''Santa Susana Pass Road'' was built in 1917.<ref name=\"SSP\" /><ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/CA-118,+California/@34.2640037,-118.6355407,1328m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80e82ec1488c91cf:0x8ed449a82307d8a5?hl=en \"Santa Susana Pass Road\"].
