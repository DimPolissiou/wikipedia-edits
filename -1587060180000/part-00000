[https://dockdogs.com DockDogs] Big Air Discipline measures the distance to the point that the base of the dog's tail breaks the surface of the water.<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 DockDogs Rules & Policies|url=https://dockdogs.com/events/rules-policies/|website=DockDogs Rules & Policies|publisher=DockDogs, Inc.|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Purina's Incredible Diving Dog event measures the distance to the point that the dog's nose is at when its body enters the water.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.purina.com/general/idcfaq.aspx | publisher= Nestle Purina | title= Incredible Dog Challenge FAQ | accessdate= 5 August 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728135429/http://www.purina.com/general/idcfaq.aspx | archive-date= 28 July 2010 | url-status= dead }}</ref>\nThe jump distance is measured electronically using [[digital video]] freeze frame technology or, in some cases, is measured manually by judges.\n\nEach team takes two jumps in round-robin format. The longer of the two jumps is that team's score for that competition. \nA jump in which the dog's tail enters the water at a point further from the dock than another part of the dog's body is scored using the point of the dog (for example, the head/nose) that breaks the surface of the water closest to the dock.\nIf the dog's strides are off so that the dog starts its jump before the end of the dock, that is a disadvantage, because the jump is always judged from the edge of the dock, not from where the dog leaves the dock.\nA jump is only official if or when the toy leaves the handler's hand. The dog is not required to retrieve the toy for the jump to count.<ref name=ukcrules/>\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:pool jumping.jpg|thumb|A place and send jump]]\n[[File:Lake jumping.jpg|thumb|A chase jump]]\t\t                          \nTwo different techniques can be used to encourage the dog to jump into the water.\n\n===Place and send===\nWalk the dog to the end of the dock and or, hold the dog back while throwing the toy into the water. Walk the dog back to the starting point, ''place'' the dog, then release or ''send'' the dog to go get the toy. This is effective for dogs that are not trained to wait or stay on the dock, especially if they have a lot of speed and can compensate for the lack of lift at the end of the dock.\n\n===Chase===\nThe dog is placed in a stay or wait at its starting position on the dock. The handler walks to the end of the dock holding the toy, then calls the dog and throws the toy, trying to keep the toy just in front of the dog's nose so they ''chase'' it into the water.\nThe goal is to use this method to get the dog at the optimum launch angle to increase distance by getting him to jump up, instead of just out or ''flat'', as with place and send.\nThe ''chase'' method is difficult to master. However, if the dog is toy-driven, he can be trained to follow the toy.\n\n==HELLO IT'S ME, I'VE BEEN WONDERING IF AFTER ALL THESE YEAR YOU'D LIKE TO MEET==\nThere are many divisions depending on the sanctioning organization. All teams are ranked according to how far they jump and are rated against teams within their own divisions for placements. Even small dogs have their own division, \"lap dogs\", along with older dogs (8 years and older), the \"veteran\" division. DockDogs also recognizes dogs over the age of 10 with their \"Legend Dog\" division.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" padding=\"5\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Ultimate Air Dogs<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.ultimateairdogs.net/UAD_Divisions.html | title= 2010 Divisions | publisher= Ultimate Air Dogs | accessdate= 3 August 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100929143747/http://ultimateairdogs.net/UAD_Divisions.html | archive-date= 29 September 2010 | url-status= dead }}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Splash Dogs<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.splashdogs.com/events/titles.php | title= Classes, Divisions and Titles | publisher= Splash Dogs | accessdate= 3 August 2010}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" | DockDogs<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 DockDogs Rules & Policies|url=https://dockdogs.com/events/rules-policies/|publisher=DockDogs Inc|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> \n|-\n!

[https://dockdogs.com DockDogs] Big Air Discipline measures the distance to the point that the base of the dog's tail breaks the surface of the water.<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 DockDogs Rules & Policies|url=https://dockdogs.com/events/rules-policies/|website=DockDogs Rules & Policies|publisher=DockDogs, Inc.|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Purina's Incredible Diving Dog event measures the distance to the point that the dog's nose is at when its body enters the water.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.purina.com/general/idcfaq.aspx | publisher= Nestle Purina | title= Incredible Dog Challenge FAQ | accessdate= 5 August 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728135429/http://www.purina.com/general/idcfaq.aspx | archive-date= 28 July 2010 | url-status= dead }}</ref>\nThe jump distance is measured electronically using [[digital video]] freeze frame technology or, in some cases, is measured manually by judges.\n\nEach team takes two jumps in round-robin format. The longer of the two jumps is that team's score for that competition. \nA jump in which the dog's tail enters the water at a point further from the dock than another part of the dog's body is scored using the point of the dog (for example, the head/nose) that breaks the surface of the water closest to the dock.\nIf the dog's strides are off so that the dog starts its jump before the end of the dock, that is a disadvantage, because the jump is always judged from the edge of the dock, not from where the dog leaves the dock.\nA jump is only official if or when the toy leaves the handler's hand. The dog is not required to retrieve the toy for the jump to count.<ref name=ukcrules/>\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:pool jumping.jpg|thumb|A place and send jump]]\n[[File:Lake jumping.jpg|thumb|A chase jump]]\t\t                          \nTwo different techniques can be used to encourage the dog to jump into the water.\n\n===Place and send===\nWalk the dog to the end of the dock and or, hold the dog back while throwing the toy into the water. Walk the dog back to the starting point, ''place'' the dog, then release or ''send'' the dog to go get the toy. This is effective for dogs that are not trained to wait or stay on the dock, especially if they have a lot of speed and can compensate for the lack of lift at the end of the dock.\n\n===Chase===\nThe dog is placed in a stay or wait at its starting position on the dock. The handler walks to the end of the dock holding the toy, then calls the dog and throws the toy, trying to keep the toy just in front of the dog's nose so they ''chase'' it into the water.\nThe goal is to use this method to get the dog at the optimum launch angle to increase distance by getting him to jump up, instead of just out or ''flat'', as with place and send.\nThe ''chase'' method is difficult to master. However, if the dog is toy-driven, he can be trained to follow the toy.\n\n==Divisions==\nThere are many divisions depending on the sanctioning organization. All teams are ranked according to how far they jump and are rated against teams within their own divisions for placements. Even small dogs have their own division, \"lap dogs\", along with older dogs (8 years and older), the \"veteran\" division. DockDogs also recognizes dogs over the age of 10 with their \"Legend Dog\" division.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" padding=\"5\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Ultimate Air Dogs<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.ultimateairdogs.net/UAD_Divisions.html | title= 2010 Divisions | publisher= Ultimate Air Dogs | accessdate= 3 August 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100929143747/http://ultimateairdogs.net/UAD_Divisions.html | archive-date= 29 September 2010 | url-status= dead }}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Splash Dogs<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.splashdogs.com/events/titles.php | title= Classes, Divisions and Titles | publisher= Splash Dogs | accessdate= 3 August 2010}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" | DockDogs<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 DockDogs Rules & Policies|url=https://dockdogs.com/events/rules-policies/|publisher=DockDogs Inc|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> \n|-\n!
