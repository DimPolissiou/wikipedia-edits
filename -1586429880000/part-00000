Moulai Ahmed was their companion. [[Abdullah (Ismaili Mustaali Missionary)|Abadullah]] was the first [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Wali-ul-Hind]] (saint of India).

People living on the western coast of India were as familiar with the annual coming of Arab traders as they were with the flocks of monsoon birds; they were as ancient a phenomenon as the monsoon itself.

New elements were introduced into the Indian architecture that include: use of shapes (instead of natural forms); inscriptional art using decorative lettering or calligraphy; inlay decoration and use of coloured marble, painted plaster and brightly coloured glazed tiles. [[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque]] built in 1193 CE was the first mosque to be built in the [[Indian subcontinent]]; its adjoining \"Tower of Victory\", the [[Qutb Minar]] also started around 1192 CE, which marked the victory of [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and his general [[Qutb al-Din Aibak]], from [[Ghazni]], Afghanistan, over local [[Rajput]] kings, is now a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Delhi]].\n\nIn contrast to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted as a method of bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar for the first time in the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.\n\n[[Islamic architecture]] in India can be divided into two parts: religious and secular. Mosques and Tombs represent the religious architecture, while palaces and forts are examples of secular Islamic architecture. Forts were essentially functional, complete with a little township within and various fortifications to engage and repel the enemy.\n\n===Mosques===\n{{Main|List of mosques in India}}\n[[File:Charminar-Pride of Hyderabad.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Charminar|Char Minar]] at Old City in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].]]\nThere are more than 300,000 active mosques in India, which is higher than any other country, including the [[Muslim world]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newseastwest.com/multicultural-india-has-more-mosques-than-any-muslim-country/ |title=Multicultural India has more mosques than any Muslim country |publisher=Newseastwest.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109134740/http://newseastwest.com/multicultural-india-has-more-mosques-than-any-muslim-country/ |archive-date=9 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mosque or masjid is a representation of Muslim art in its simplest form. The mosque is basically an open courtyard surrounded by a pillared verandah, crowned off with a dome. A ''[[mihrab]]'' indicates the direction of the ''qibla'' for prayer. Towards the right of the ''mihrab'' stands the ''minbar'' or pulpit from where the ''Imam'' presides over the proceedings. An elevated platform, usually a minaret from where the Faithful are summoned to attend prayers is an invariable part of a mosque. Large mosques where the faithful assemble for the Friday prayers are called the Jama Masjids.\n\n===Tombs and Mausoleum===\nThe tomb or [[maqbara]] could range from being a simple affair (Aurangazeb's grave) to an awesome structure enveloped in grandeur ([[Taj Mahal]]). The tomb usually consists of a solitary compartment or tomb chamber known as the ''huzrah'' in whose centre is the cenotaph or ''zarih''. This entire structure is covered with an elaborate dome. In the underground chamber lies the mortuary or the ''[[maqbara]]'', in which the corpse is buried in a grave or ''qabr''. Smaller tombs may have a ''mihrab'', although larger mausoleums have a separate mosque located at a distance from the main tomb. Normally the whole tomb complex or ''rauza'' is surrounded by an enclosure. The tomb of a Muslim saint is called a [[dargah]]. Almost all Islamic monuments were subjected to free use of verses from the Quran and a great amount of time was spent in carving out minute details on walls, ceilings, pillars and domes.\n\n===Styles of Islamic architecture in India===\nIslamic architecture in India can be classified into three sections: Delhi or the imperial style (1191 to 1557 CE); the provincial style, encompassing the surrounding areas like [[Ahmedabad]], [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]] and the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]; and the [[Mughal architecture]] style (1526 to 1707 CE).<ref>(Courtesy: Culturopedia.com)</ref>\n\n==Law and politics==\nCertain civil matters of jurisdiction for Muslims such as marriage, inheritance and [[waqf]] properties are governed by the Muslim Personal Law,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/assc/india/India_Musl_Personal.htm |title=Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 \u2013 Resources for Jurisdictional Research, Yale |access-date=8 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728183442/http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/assc/india/India_Musl_Personal.htm |archive-date=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which was developed during British rule and subsequently became part of independent India with some amendments.<ref name=\"Emory-19491126\">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/india.htm |title=India |publisher=law.emory.edu |date=26 November 1949 |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.law.yale.edu/research/guides/resources/outlines-muhammadan-law-fyzee-aaa-new-dehli-oup-2008-5th-ed |title=Outlines of Muhammadan Law / FYZEE, A.A.A.\" New Delhi : OUP, 2008 (5th ed.) &#124; Yale Law School Library |publisher=Library.law.yale.edu |date=2013-04-21 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> Indian Muslim personal law is not developed as a Sharia Law but as an interpretation of existing Muslim laws as part of Common Law.

The legacy of the Muslim conquest of South Asia is a hotly debated issue and argued even today.\n\nMuslim invaders were not all simply raiders. Later rulers fought on to win kingdoms and stayed to create new ruling dynasties. The practices of these new rulers and their subsequent heirs (some of whom were born of Hindu wives) varied considerably. While some were uniformly hated, others developed a popular following. According to the memoirs of [[Ibn Battuta]] who travelled through [[Delhi]] in the 14th century, one of the previous sultans had been especially brutal and was deeply hated by Delhi's population, Batuta's memoirs also indicate that Muslims from the Arab world, [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Anatolia]] were often favoured with important posts at the royal courts suggesting that locals may have played a somewhat subordinate role in the Delhi administration. The term \"Turk\" was commonly used to refer to their higher social status. S.A.A. Rizvi (''The Wonder That Was India \u2013 II''), however points to [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] as not only encouraging locals but promoting artisan groups such as cooks, barbers and gardeners to high administrative posts. In his reign, it is likely that conversions to Islam took place as a means of seeking greater social mobility and improved social standing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://india_resource.tripod.com/islam.html |title=Islam and the sub-continent \u2013 appraising its impact |access-date=27 November 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209030754/india_resource.tripod.com/islam.html |archive-date=9 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNumerous temples were destroyed by Muslim conquerors.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vyXxEX5PQH8C&pg=PA362#v=onepage&f=false|title=Ornament in Indian Architecture|first=Margaret Prosser|last=Allen|page=362|isbn=978-0874133998 |publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1991}}</ref> Richard M.

Conflict between early Sikhs and the Muslim power center at Delhi reached an early high point in 1606 when [[Guru Arjan]], the fifth guru of the Sikhs, was tortured and killed by Jahangir, the Mughal emperor. After the death of the fifth beloved Guru his son had taken his spot [[Guru Hargobind]] who basically made the Sikhs a warrior religion. Guru ji was the first to defeat the Mughal empire in a battle which had taken place in present [[Sri Hargobindpur]] in [[Gurdaspur]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Shackle|first=Christopher|author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh|year=2005|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures|publisher=Routledge|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-415-26604-1|pages=xv\u2013xvi}}</ref> After this point the Sikhs were forced to organise themselves militarily for their protection. Later in the 16th century, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur|Tegh Bahadur]] became guru in 1665 and led the Sikhs until 1675. Teg Bahadur was executed by the Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] for helping to protect Hindus, after a delegation of [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s came to him for help when the Emperor condemned them to death for failing to convert to Islam.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rama|first=Swami|year=1986|title=Celestial Song/Gobind Geet: The Dramatic Dialogue Between Guru Gobind Singh and Banda Singh Bahadur|publisher=Himalayan Institute Press|isbn = 0-89389-103-7|pages=7\u20138}}</ref> At this point [[Aurangzeb]] had instituted forceful conversions for which they would charge citizens with various accusations granting them to have charges and execution waved off if they converted this led to a high increase of violence between the Sikhs and Hindus as well as rebellions of [[Aurangzeb]]'s empire. This is an early example which illustrates how the Hindu-Muslim conflict and the Muslim-Sikh conflicts are connected. After which Guru Gobind Singh and the Sikhs helped the next successor of the throne of India to rise who was Bahadur Shah Zafar for certain period of time good relations were maintained somewhat like they were in [[Akbar]]'s time until disputes arose again. The Mughal period saw various invaders coming into India through Punjab with which they would loot and severely plunder. Better relations have been seen by [[Dulla Bhatti]], [[Mian Mir]], Pir Budhu Shah, Pir Bhikham Shah, [[Bulleh Shah]].\n\nIn 1699, the [[Khalsa]] was founded by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], the last guru. A former ascetic was charged by Gobind Singh with the duty of punishing those who had persecuted the Sikhs. After the guru's death, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur became the leader of the Sikh army and was responsible for several attacks on the Mughal empire. He was executed by the emperor [[Jahandar Shah]] after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|authorlink=Khushwant Singh|year=2006|title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=India|isbn = 0-19-567747-1|pages=47\u201353}}</ref> The decline of Mughal power during the 17th and 18th centuries, along with the growing strength of the [[Sikh Empire]] resulted in a balance of power which protected the Sikhs from more violence. The Sikh empire was absorbed into the British Indian empire after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1849.\n\nMassive population exchanges took place during the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, and the British Indian province of Punjab was divided into two parts, and the western parts were given to the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], while the eastern parts were given to the [[Union of India]]. 5.3&nbsp;million Muslims moved from India to West Punjab in Pakistan, 3.4&nbsp;million Hindus and Sikhs moved from Pakistan to East Punjab in India. The newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude, and massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border. Estimates of the number of deaths range around roughly 500,000, with low estimates at 200,000 and high estimates at 1,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat3.htm#India|title=War Stats Redirect |publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nTens of thousands of Muslims are living with a disguised identity as Sikhs since the confessional cleansing during the [[Partition of India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabrang.com/cc/archive/2001/march01/history.htm|title=CC current issue|last=Irfan|website=www.sabrang.com|access-date=2017-07-29}}</ref>\n\n===Muslim\u2013Christian conflict===\n[[Image:JamalabadFortPassage.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Jamalabad|Jamalabad fort]] route.

With the advent of European colonialism in India with the demise of Mughal empire beginning from the 18th century, Christians were persecuted in some Muslim ruled princely states in India.\n\n;Anti-Christian persecution by [[Tipu Sultan]] in the 17th century\nPerhaps the most infamous acts of anti-Christian persecution by Muslims was committed by [[Tipu Sultan]], the ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] against the [[Mangalorean Catholics]].

A Sufi attains a direct vision of oneness with God, often on the edges of orthodox behaviour, and can thus become a Pir (living saint) who may take on disciples ([[murid]]s) and set up a spiritual lineage that can last for generations. Orders of Sufis became important in India during the thirteenth century following the ministry of [[Moinuddin Chishti]] (1142\u20131236), who settled in [[Ajmer]] and attracted large numbers of converts to Islam because of his holiness. His [[Chishti Order]] went on to become the most influential Sufi lineage in India, although other orders from Central Asia and Southwest Asia also reached India and played a major role in the spread of Islam. In this way, they created a large literature in [[regional language]]s that embedded Islamic culture deeply into older South Asian traditions.\n\n==Leadership and organisations==\n[[File:Protest in U.P against Caricature of Prophet of Islam.jpg|thumb|400px|[[AIUMB]] protest against caricature of Prophet of Islam in the city of [[Sambhal]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].]]\n* The [[Ajmer Sharif Dargah]] and [[Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat]] at [[Bareilly]] Shareef are prime center of Sufi oriented Sunni Muslims of India.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/zG3aMfKAuC26PNQsW8ODZJ/The-sufi-solution.html|title=The sufi solution|website=www.livemint.com|access-date=2017-07-29}}</ref>\n* Indian [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] form a substantial minority within the Muslim community of India comprising between 25\u201331% of total Muslim population in an estimation done during mid-2005 to 2006 of the then Indian Muslim population of 157&nbsp;million.

Moulai Ahmed was their companion. [[Abdullah (Ismaili Mustaali Missionary)|Abadullah]] was the first [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Wali-ul-Hind]] (saint of India).

People living on the western coast of India were as familiar with the annual coming of Arab traders as they were with the flocks of monsoon birds; they were as ancient a phenomenon as the monsoon itself. However, whereas monsoon birds flew back to Africa after a sojourn of few months, not all traders returned to their homes in the desert; many married Indian women and settled in India.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_the_Sikhs.html?id=-nsGAQAAIAAJ|title=A history of the Sikhs|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=|location=|pages=20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of [[Muhammad]] (569\u2013632 CE) changed the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|idolatrous]] and easy-going Arabs into a nation unified by faith and fired with zeal to spread the gospel of Islam.

The movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream Muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to Ghulam Ahmad's claim to be a prophet within Islam.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8711026.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 Who are the Ahmadi}}</ref>\n\nAhmaddiya have been identified as sects of Islam in [[2011 Census of India]] apart from Sunnis, Shias, Bohras and Agakhanis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ahmadiyyas-islam-sects-islam-ahmadiyyas-sect-ahmadiyyas-islam-islamic-sects-islam-india-ahmadiyya-legal-status-2011-census-india-population-india-news-2952701/|title=Sunnis, Shias, Bohras, Agakhanis and Ahmadiyyas were identified as sects of Islam.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Protest-against-inclusion-of-Ahmediyyas-in-Muslim-census/articleshow/53645457.cms|title=Protest against inclusion of Ahmediyyas in Muslim census}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/ahmadiyya-community-census-india-muslims-2954285/|title=Minority in a minority}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/in-their-search-for-pure-islam-many-muslim-sects-consider-others-insufficient-or-infidels-2941564.html|title=Ahmadiyyas find place as Islam sect in census}}</ref> India has a significant Ahmadiyya population.<ref name=\"Number of Ahmadis in India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,47f237db2,3ae6ad202c,0.html|title=Number of Ahmadis in India|publisher=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|date=1 November 1991|accessdate=9 March 2009}}</ref> Most of them live in Rajasthan, [[Odisha]], Haryana, Bihar, Delhi, [[Uttar Pradesh]], and a few in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] in the area of Qadian.

New elements were introduced into the Indian architecture that include: use of shapes (instead of natural forms); inscriptional art using decorative lettering or calligraphy; inlay decoration and use of coloured marble, painted plaster and brightly coloured glazed tiles. [[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque]] built in 1193 CE was the first mosque to be built in the [[Indian subcontinent]]; its adjoining \"Tower of Victory\", the [[Qutb Minar]] also started around 1192 CE, which marked the victory of [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and his general [[Qutb al-Din Aibak]], from [[Ghazni]], Afghanistan, over local [[Rajput]] kings, is now a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Delhi]].\n\nIn contrast to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted as a method of bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar for the first time in the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.\n\n[[Islamic architecture]] in India can be divided into two parts: religious and secular. Mosques and Tombs represent the religious architecture, while palaces and forts are examples of secular Islamic architecture. Forts were essentially functional, complete with a little township within and various fortifications to engage and repel the enemy.\n\n===Mosques===\n{{Main|List of mosques in India}}\n[[File:Charminar-Pride of Hyderabad.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Charminar|Char Minar]] at Old City in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].]]\nThere are more than 300,000 active mosques in India, which is higher than any other country, including the [[Muslim world]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newseastwest.com/multicultural-india-has-more-mosques-than-any-muslim-country/ |title=Multicultural India has more mosques than any Muslim country |publisher=Newseastwest.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109134740/http://newseastwest.com/multicultural-india-has-more-mosques-than-any-muslim-country/ |archive-date=9 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mosque or masjid is a representation of Muslim art in its simplest form. The mosque is basically an open courtyard surrounded by a pillared verandah, crowned off with a dome. A ''[[mihrab]]'' indicates the direction of the ''qibla'' for prayer. Towards the right of the ''mihrab'' stands the ''minbar'' or pulpit from where the ''Imam'' presides over the proceedings. An elevated platform, usually a minaret from where the Faithful are summoned to attend prayers is an invariable part of a mosque. Large mosques where the faithful assemble for the Friday prayers are called the Jama Masjids.\n\n===Tombs and Mausoleum===\nThe tomb or [[maqbara]] could range from being a simple affair (Aurangazeb's grave) to an awesome structure enveloped in grandeur ([[Taj Mahal]]). The tomb usually consists of a solitary compartment or tomb chamber known as the ''huzrah'' in whose centre is the cenotaph or ''zarih''. This entire structure is covered with an elaborate dome. In the underground chamber lies the mortuary or the ''[[maqbara]]'', in which the corpse is buried in a grave or ''qabr''. Smaller tombs may have a ''mihrab'', although larger mausoleums have a separate mosque located at a distance from the main tomb. Normally the whole tomb complex or ''rauza'' is surrounded by an enclosure. The tomb of a Muslim saint is called a [[dargah]]. Almost all Islamic monuments were subjected to free use of verses from the Quran and a great amount of time was spent in carving out minute details on walls, ceilings, pillars and domes.\n\n===Styles of Islamic architecture in India===\nIslamic architecture in India can be classified into three sections: Delhi or the imperial style (1191 to 1557 CE); the provincial style, encompassing the surrounding areas like [[Ahmedabad]], [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]] and the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]; and the [[Mughal architecture]] style (1526 to 1707 CE).<ref>(Courtesy: Culturopedia.com)</ref>\n\n==Law and politics==\nCertain civil matters of jurisdiction for Muslims such as marriage, inheritance and [[waqf]] properties are governed by the Muslim Personal Law,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/assc/india/India_Musl_Personal.htm |title=Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 \u2013 Resources for Jurisdictional Research, Yale |access-date=8 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728183442/http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/assc/india/India_Musl_Personal.htm |archive-date=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which was developed during British rule and subsequently became part of independent India with some amendments.<ref name=\"Emory-19491126\">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/india.htm |title=India |publisher=law.emory.edu |date=26 November 1949 |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.law.yale.edu/research/guides/resources/outlines-muhammadan-law-fyzee-aaa-new-dehli-oup-2008-5th-ed |title=Outlines of Muhammadan Law / FYZEE, A.A.A.\" New Delhi : OUP, 2008 (5th ed.) &#124; Yale Law School Library |publisher=Library.law.yale.edu |date=2013-04-21 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> Indian Muslim personal law is not developed as a Sharia Law but as an interpretation of existing Muslim laws as part of Common Law.

The legacy of the Muslim conquest of South Asia is a hotly debated issue and argued even today.\n\nMuslim invaders were not all simply raiders. Later rulers fought on to win kingdoms and stayed to create new ruling dynasties. The practices of these new rulers and their subsequent heirs (some of whom were born of Hindu wives) varied considerably. While some were uniformly hated, others developed a popular following. According to the memoirs of [[Ibn Battuta]] who travelled through [[Delhi]] in the 14th century, one of the previous sultans had been especially brutal and was deeply hated by Delhi's population, Batuta's memoirs also indicate that Muslims from the Arab world, [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Anatolia]] were often favoured with important posts at the royal courts suggesting that locals may have played a somewhat subordinate role in the Delhi administration. The term \"Turk\" was commonly used to refer to their higher social status. S.A.A. Rizvi (''The Wonder That Was India \u2013 II''), however points to [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] as not only encouraging locals but promoting artisan groups such as cooks, barbers and gardeners to high administrative posts. In his reign, it is likely that conversions to Islam took place as a means of seeking greater social mobility and improved social standing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://india_resource.tripod.com/islam.html |title=Islam and the sub-continent \u2013 appraising its impact |access-date=27 November 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209030754/india_resource.tripod.com/islam.html |archive-date=9 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNumerous temples were destroyed by Muslim conquerors.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vyXxEX5PQH8C&pg=PA362#v=onepage&f=false|title=Ornament in Indian Architecture|first=Margaret Prosser|last=Allen|page=362|isbn=978-0874133998 |publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1991}}</ref> Richard M.

These include [[1969 Gujarat riots]], [[1970 Bhiwandi riots]], 1983 [[Nellie massacre]], and the [[1989 Bhagalpur violence]].

Conflict between early Sikhs and the Muslim power center at Delhi reached an early high point in 1606 when [[Guru Arjan]], the fifth guru of the Sikhs, was tortured and killed by Jahangir, the Mughal emperor. After the death of the fifth beloved Guru his son had taken his spot [[Guru Hargobind]] who basically made the Sikhs a warrior religion.

This is an early example which illustrates how the Hindu-Muslim conflict and the Muslim-Sikh conflicts are connected. After which Guru Gobind Singh and the Sikhs helped the next successor of the throne of India to rise who was Bahadur Shah Zafar for certain period of time good relations were maintained somewhat like they were in [[Akbar]]'s time until disputes arose again. The Mughal period saw various invaders coming into India through Punjab with which they would loot and severely plunder. Better relations have been seen by [[Dulla Bhatti]], [[Mian Mir]], Pir Budhu Shah, Pir Bhikham Shah, [[Bulleh Shah]].\n\nIn 1699, the [[Khalsa]] was founded by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], the last guru. A former ascetic was charged by Gobind Singh with the duty of punishing those who had persecuted the Sikhs.

The Sikh empire was absorbed into the British Indian empire after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1849.\n\nMassive population exchanges took place during the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, and the British Indian province of Punjab was divided into two parts, and the western parts were given to the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], while the eastern parts were given to the [[Union of India]]. 5.3&nbsp;million Muslims moved from India to West Punjab in Pakistan, 3.4&nbsp;million Hindus and Sikhs moved from Pakistan to East Punjab in India. The newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude, and massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border.

A Sufi attains a direct vision of oneness with God, often on the edges of orthodox behaviour, and can thus become a Pir (living saint) who may take on disciples ([[murid]]s) and set up a spiritual lineage that can last for generations. Orders of Sufis became important in India during the thirteenth century following the ministry of [[Moinuddin Chishti]] (1142\u20131236), who settled in [[Ajmer]] and attracted large numbers of converts to Islam because of his holiness. His [[Chishti Order]] went on to become the most influential Sufi lineage in India, although other orders from Central Asia and Southwest Asia also reached India and played a major role in the spread of Islam. In this way, they created a large literature in [[regional language]]s that embedded Islamic culture deeply into older South Asian traditions.\n\n==Leadership and organisations==\n[[File:Protest in U.P against Caricature of Prophet of Islam.jpg|thumb|400px|[[AIUMB]] protest against caricature of Prophet of Islam in the city of [[Sambhal]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].]]\n* The [[Ajmer Sharif Dargah]] and [[Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat]] at [[Bareilly]] Shareef are prime center of Sufi oriented Sunni Muslims of India.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/zG3aMfKAuC26PNQsW8ODZJ/The-sufi-solution.html|title=The sufi solution|website=www.livemint.com|access-date=2017-07-29}}</ref>\n* Indian [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] form a substantial minority within the Muslim community of India comprising between 25\u201331% of total Muslim population in an estimation done during mid-2005 to 2006 of the then Indian Muslim population of 157 million.

The university is affiliated with [[IRGC]], [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)]], and [[Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (Iran)]]. It is sometimes referred to as \"IHU\".

The student body consists of 6,000 students and cadets. The procedure for accepting and processing requests at IHU is different from other universities. Regular students can get admission by passing [[Iranian University Entrance Exam]] which is done yearly by [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)]]. Those students are without scholarship and will not be employed by [[IRGC]]. They should also pay tuition fees.

It included faculty of engineering science, faculty of natural science, faculty of social science, and faculty of medicine in 1987. Later, it also included faculty of military science. In 1994, the faculty of medicine seceded to become the [[Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University]], which is the primary medical institution, and currently trains students up to PhD levels in three faculties, namely: Nursing, Allied Health, and Medicine, as well as the Institute of Research for Military Medicine.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University\n|publisher=(\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u067e\u0632\u0634\u0643\u064a \u0628\u0642\u064a\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647)}}</ref>\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Imam Hossein University Entrance.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Imam Hossein University Main Entrance Gate]]\n\nIn 1963, Iran placed all military factories under the Military Industries Organization (MIO) of the Ministry of War.<ref name=DIO1>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/dio.htm\n|title=Defense Industries Organization (DIO)\n|accessdate=2008-09-14\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref> Over the next fifteen years, they produced small arms ammunition, explosives, and mortar rounds and fuses. They furthermore produced rifles and machine guns under West German license. Additionally, they assembled helicopters, jeeps, trucks, and trailers from imported kits. However, the Iran Revolution stopped all activities. The MIO was unable to operate without foreign experts, so it had lost much of its management ability and control over its industrial facilities by 1981.\n\nIn late 1981, the revolutionary government brought together all military industrial units and placed them under the [[Defense Industries Organization]] (DIO).<ref name=DIO2>{{cite web\n|url=http://cns.miis.edu/reports/pdfs/9707iran.pdf\n|title=Military Industries in the Islamic Republic of Iran: An Assessment of the Defense Industries Organization (DIO)\n|accessdate=1996-05-01\n|publisher=United States Air Force Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611080636/http://cns.miis.edu/reports/pdfs/9707iran.pdf\n|archive-date=June 11, 2011\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> By 1986, a large number of infantry rifles, machine guns, and mortars and some small-arms ammunition were being manufactured locally.

They transferred all of their nuclear facilities around the country to the Defense Ministry and also to the Imam Hossein University. The announcement on the university's now defunct website shed light on one of Iran's developing nuclear programme and the laser enrichment technique. Prof. Raymond Tanter said that it particularly is importance to mention laser enrichment as a mean to create nuclear fuel. One of the most critical projects is conducted at the Imam Hossein University on use of lasers for enrichment. In addition to laser enrichment, the university carried out a test on neutron generator that can also trigger the fission chain reaction.<ref name=Ynetnews/>\n\nIn January 2006, the university had the third nationwide congress on the modern defensive wars in the field of chemical, biological, nuclear wars as announced on the university's website, which is no longer online. According to the announcement, the congress discussed the new types of bombs, such as: electromagnetic, air fuelled, graphite, laser and enfeebling bombs. Prof. Raymond Tanter argued the conference was a part of the accelerating research and development on nuclear programme.<ref name=Ynetnews/>\n\n===Physics Research Center===\nAccording to the [[ElBaradei]]'s report<ref name=IAEA>{{cite web\n|url=http://threatswatch.org/analysis/2008/02/iaea-schweizer-kase/\n|title=Holes and Questions In The IAEA's Iran Report\n|accessdate=2008-02-27\n|publisher=Threats Watch}}</ref> of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the university (called a \"technical university\" in the report) houses the Physics Research Center (PHRC), which controls the Iranian nuclear program, once under the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] (AEOI), Iran's civilian nuclear agency.<ref name=IAEA/> One of the principal sources of nuclear experts has been the Imam Hossein University. Part of the takeover of the Iranian nuclear program also necessarily included transferring experts from around the country into this university. The IAEA stated the [[IRGC]] is believed to have co-opted the nuclear research facilities and experts of the university system in order to conceal and cloak the true military aspect of the Iranian nuclear program. For example, an Iranian company, Kimia Maadan (KM) Company, made use of experts from this university.<ref name=IAEA/> The IAEA had also questions regarding the role and origin of KM Company. The company was founded by nuclear experts, a core staff about half a dozen experts who had previously worked for the Iranian Ore Processing Center (OPC). There are relationships among various university research teams, PHRC of the Imam Hossein University, the Education Research Institute (ERI) and the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) and KM Company, each working on different aspects of the Iranian nuclear program.<ref name=IAEA/>\n\nOne of the research projects addressed in the IAEA report<ref name=IAEA/> is the Iranian Green Salt Project, apparently managed by KM Company. The project performed a flowsheet of bench scale conversion of uranium oxide (UO2) into 1 ton of UF4 per year, also known as Green Salt. It is an early step in an enrichment process, beyond the capacity or scope of the Uranium Ore Concentration (UOC) plant. According to the IAEA report, KM Company designed and built a turnkey (flowsheet). The document also referred to the project concerning the missile re-entry vehicle. However, Iran answered that the flowsheets and allegations were baseless and fabrications, and the only project that the KM Company worked on was the UOC plant.\n\nThe IAEA has also reported the Iranian testing of multiple high-explosive detonators designs and documents the layout for an underground nuclear blast test facility in this university.\nIn 2006, a senior US official revealed the Washington Post a diagram being schematically consistent with a nuclear test-site schematic in Iran.<ref name=washingtonpost>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/07/AR2006020702126_pf.html\n|title=Nuclear Case Against Iran\n|accessdate=2006-02-08\n|work=Washington Post\n| first=Dafna\n| last=Linzer}}</ref> Later in 2006, a contingent of senior officers from Iran travelled to North Korea to see an underground facility to test explosion. IAEA also made question about the Iranian [[Shahab-3]] missile designs. Specifically, re-entry vehicle designs are believed to be engineered for the ability to carry nuclear warheads.\n\nThe various scientific research groups of Iran's nuclear program, run from this university under the direction of the [[IRGC]], are including efforts to obtain training courses and software on spark gaps, shock wave software, neutron sources, special steel parts, radiation measurement equipment, including borehole spectrometers. Nonetheless, Iran answered that it sought PAM shock software to study [[aircraft]], collision of cars, [[airbag]]s and for the design of [[seatbelt]]s.<ref name=IAEA/>\n\n===Biological Research Center===\nThe [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS) made a report about the biological activities in Iran, which are centered on the productions of microbial bombs using [[anthrax]], [[smallpox]] virus, [[typhoid]] fever, high dosage of [[aflatoxin]], plague microbes, and chloromicrobes, done at the Imam Hossein University in Tehran.

The Shahab-3 is a liquid-fueled single-stage missile. The Iran Space Research Center started testing launch capabilities since early 2007 reaching 150\u2013200&nbsp;km altitude. These rockets were based on [[Shahab-3]] series and were typically equipped with wind, air and temperature instruments. In August 2008, Iran developed a two-stage launch vehicle [[Safir-1]] which launched a dummy satellite. On February 2009, Iran launched a satellite named [[Omid]] into orbit using the domestically built launch vehicle [[Safir-2]], thus becoming the 9th nation to do so on [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country]].

During the [[Iranian Revolution]], the garrison fell to Revolutionaries after a fight in which several officers of the guard were killed. The site was later on converted to a research facility. The Lavizan Technical Site includes faculties of installations industries and metallurgy. According to a document, the alleged Iranian nuclear warheads were being stored in the Lavizan military camp in the Teheran area in 1992. Another document discusses the production of a solid fuel missile prototype completed in Lavizan.<ref name=Lavizan1>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/lavizan.htm\n|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)\n|accessdate=2004-09-11\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref>\n\nA satellite image of 10 May 2004 showed that Iran had almost totally razed part of the Lavizan Technical Research Center.<ref name=Lavizan1/> It showed Iran had been demolishing buildings at Lavizan. The Lavizan Center had imported a whole-body counter (WBC), a device used to identify and measure the radioactive material in the body of human beings and animals.  On 29 June 2004, El Baradei said that Iran had accepted that the alleged concealed nuclear site in Tehran was a military-research complex before it was razed.<ref name=Lavizan1/> The Iranian authorities stated that this was a physics institute later on turned to be a biotechnology research and development center.\n\n===Aerospace Industries Organization===\n[[Iran Aviation Industries Organization|Aerospace Industries Organization]] (AIO) is a leading industrial subsidiary of the Ministry of Defense. More than 13 large factories with over 10,000 expert personnel are occupied in manufacturing a vast variety of military and non-military purposes.<ref name=Lavizan1/> Products include different types of weapons such as [[guns]], [[rocket]]s, [[missiles]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], [[bomb]]s, [[rocket]] launchers, field kitchens, [[gyroscopes]], transportation means, police equipment, and [[helmets]]. Engineering services include precision machining, metal forming, software services, quality control test, dimensional measurement, [[CNC]] machine, and [[Coordinate Measuring Machine]] (CMM).\n\nThe Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO), also known as the Sanam Industrial Group, is the Defense Industries Organization (DIO) Missile Industries Group. Sanam Industries Group is said to be the lead organization for the development of the [[Shahab-3]] missile. In 1998, [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]] had reportedly negotiated an agreement with Sanam Industries Group to provide telemetry infrastructure for Iran's [[Shahab-3]] and [[Shahab-4]] ballistic missile.<ref name=Lavizan1/>\n\n[[Baltic State Technical University]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] has allegedly contracted with the Sanam Industrial group to train Iranian students in order to design long-range solid fuel rocket boosters. They together created a center known as Persepolis as part of a contract concluded in 1996. On 22 June 1998, Iranian students were expelled from Baltic State Technical University as part of Russia's international obligations to control the spread of missile technology.<ref name=Lavizan1/>\n\nIn addition to military products, the Sanam Industrial Group also produces non-military products to convene domestic and export markets demands including TVs, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, various types of grinding wheels, stainless steel dishes, industrial fans, motor pumps, and automotive parts. The Sanam Washing Machine use Korean SAMSUNG technology, by which it becomes a powerful, economic and durable washing machine. Sanam Industrial Group in Parchin is licensed by the Italian company [[Lombardini S.r.l.|Lombardini]] to fabricate internal combustion engines, that are used in automotive, agricultural, industrial and marine applications.<ref name=Lavizan1/>\n\n===Parchin site===\n[[Parchin]] Complex, 30 kilometers southeast of Tehran, was the site for the implementation of a variety of defense projects. Parchin was the center of the Defense Industries Organization's (DIO) Chemical industry, and, possibly, the home of the main producers of the Iran's missiles. Parchin was opened in 1939, and was in operation since before the Second World War.<ref name=Parchin2>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/parchin.htm\n|title=Parchin\n|accessdate=2004-09-11\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref> Very few information was available about the post-Revolutionary Iranian arms industry. On 25 August 1999, it included the Parchin Chemical Factories (PCF). PCF was equipped with modern technology producing various commercial explosives, and chemical material.\n\nParchin is one of Iran's major chemical weapons facilities, along with the facilities located at [[Damghan]], [[Esfahan]] and [[Qazvin]]. US intelligence said Iran has been continuing to improve and develop its chemical warfare production infrastructure and munitions arsenal until 2003.<ref name=Parchin2/> US intelligence reporting Iran tries to dual-use facilities could quickly field chemical agents, but are not mainly active in military. It made also question the character of the facilities at Parchin.<ref name=Parchin2/>\n\nOn 29 December 2003, the Wall Street Journal reported that, [[Ahmad Shirzad]], a deputy from the city of Isfahan, stated that there was a large nuclear underground facility in Parchin.<ref name=benadorassociates>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.benadorassociates.com/article/789\n|title=The Meaning of Iranian Inspections.\n|accessdate=2003-12-19\n|publisher=Wall Street Journal }}</ref>\nIn an article in the Washington Times, on 7 March 2004, claimed that Iran's nuclear weapons program included use of Belarus-Russian filtering and high-temperature melting technologies for uranium enrichment.<ref name=WashingtonTimes>{{cite web\n|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/06/20040306-102129-4558r/\n|title=Iran's nuclear menace\n|accessdate=2004-03-07\n|publisher=Washington Post}}</ref> The accurate technique supposedly involved was unclear, but would appear to have been thermal diffusion.\n\nThe generally Parchin institute represents the chief center of Iran's military industry, so a nuclear program would by now include all the proficiency required within commuting distance. The suspect area was physically isolated from other components, which implies that it was not part of the ammo, chemical or missile programs. The United States made also questions whether Iran is testing high explosives at Parchin.<ref name=Parchin1>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/parchin-2.htm\n|title=Parchin Nuclear Facility\n|accessdate=2008-07-01\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref> Nonetheless, [[Hossein Mousavian]], Iran's chief delegate to the [[IAEA]], rejected all claims about a nuclear testing area at Parchin. He categorically denied any nuclear activities in Parchin. He accused the US of deliberately using misinformation to embarrass Iran at [[IAEA]] hearings.<ref name=Parchin1/>\n\nJay C. Davis, former head of the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] at the [[US Department of Defense]], said neither the design of the facility nor the nature of the tests is unique to nuclear weapons. Davis added that environmental sampling done by [[IAEA]] inspectors could detect the presence of by-products used in the testing of high explosives for a nuclear weapon.<ref name=Parchin1/>  On 17 September 2004 [[IAEA]] head [[El Baradei]] said his organization had found no sign of nuclear-related activity at the Parchin site in Iran, which several US officials had said might be to secret nuclear weapons research. Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Parchin military site in the interests of transparency, but the visit was limited to only few areas.\n\nOn 1 March 2005, Iran abandoned a second request by the [[IAEA]] to visit again the Parchin site. However, the IAEA was eventually allowed entrance to the Parchin facility in November 2005.<ref name=Parchin1/> The [[IAEA]] did not observe any unusual activities in the buildings visited, and the results of the analysis of environmental samples did not indicate the presence of nuclear material.<ref name=Parchin1/>\n\n==Notable alumni and staff==\n{{See also|Category:Imam Hossein University

The university is affiliated with [[IRGC]], [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)]], and [[Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (Iran)]]. It is sometimes referred to as \"IHU\".

The student body consists of 6,000 students and cadets. The procedure for accepting and processing requests at IHU is different from other universities. Regular students can get admission by passing [[Iranian University Entrance Exam]] which is done yearly by [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)]]. Those students are without scholarship and will not be employed by [[IRGC]]. They should also pay tuition fees.

But, the ''Imam Hossein Cadet College'' was separated from the academic division in 2005. Then, the academic division was relocated to another recently built infrastructure, and was renamed to the \"Imam Hossein Comprehensive University\".\n\n==History==\nThe university was established in 1986 by [[IRGC]] Commander Seyed Mehdi Mousavi Zare, named ''Imam Hossein Higher Education'' and approved as a university by [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)]]. It included faculty of engineering science, faculty of natural science, faculty of social science, and faculty of medicine in 1987. Later, it also included faculty of military science. In 1994, the faculty of medicine seceded to become the [[Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University]], which is the primary medical institution, and currently trains students up to PhD levels in three faculties, namely: Nursing, Allied Health, and Medicine, as well as the Institute of Research for Military Medicine.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University\n|publisher=(\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u067e\u0632\u0634\u0643\u064a \u0628\u0642\u064a\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647)}}</ref>\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Imam Hossein University Entrance.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Imam Hossein University Main Entrance Gate]]\n\nIn 1963, Iran placed all military factories under the Military Industries Organization (MIO) of the Ministry of War.<ref name=DIO1>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/dio.htm\n|title=Defense Industries Organization (DIO)\n|accessdate=2008-09-14\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref> Over the next fifteen years, they produced small arms ammunition, explosives, and mortar rounds and fuses.

They transferred all of their nuclear facilities around the country to the Defense Ministry and also to the Imam Hossein University. The announcement on the university's now defunct website shed light on one of Iran's developing nuclear programme and the laser enrichment technique. Prof. Raymond Tanter said that it particularly is importance to mention laser enrichment as a mean to create nuclear fuel. One of the most critical projects is conducted at the Imam Hossein University on use of lasers for enrichment. In addition to laser enrichment, the university carried out a test on neutron generator that can also trigger the fission chain reaction.<ref name=Ynetnews/>\n\nIn January 2006, the university had the third nationwide congress on the modern defensive wars in the field of chemical, biological, nuclear wars as announced on the university's website, which is no longer online. According to the announcement, the congress discussed the new types of bombs, such as: electromagnetic, air fuelled, graphite, laser and enfeebling bombs. Prof. Raymond Tanter argued the conference was a part of the accelerating research and development on nuclear programme.<ref name=Ynetnews/>\n\n===Physics Research Center===\nAccording to the [[ElBaradei]]'s report<ref name=IAEA>{{cite web\n|url=http://threatswatch.org/analysis/2008/02/iaea-schweizer-kase/\n|title=Holes and Questions In The IAEA's Iran Report\n|accessdate=2008-02-27\n|publisher=Threats Watch}}</ref> of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the university (called a \"technical university\" in the report) houses the Physics Research Center (PHRC), which controls the Iranian nuclear program, once under the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] (AEOI), Iran's civilian nuclear agency.<ref name=IAEA/> One of the principal sources of nuclear experts has been the Imam Hossein University. Part of the takeover of the Iranian nuclear program also necessarily included transferring experts from around the country into this university. The IAEA stated the [[IRGC]] is believed to have co-opted the nuclear research facilities and experts of the university system in order to conceal and cloak the true military aspect of the Iranian nuclear program. For example, an Iranian company, Kimia Maadan (KM) Company, made use of experts from this university.<ref name=IAEA/> The IAEA had also questions regarding the role and origin of KM Company. The company was founded by nuclear experts, a core staff about half a dozen experts who had previously worked for the Iranian Ore Processing Center (OPC). There are relationships among various university research teams, PHRC of the Imam Hossein University, the Education Research Institute (ERI) and the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) and KM Company, each working on different aspects of the Iranian nuclear program.<ref name=IAEA/>\n\nOne of the research projects addressed in the IAEA report<ref name=IAEA/> is the Iranian Green Salt Project, apparently managed by KM Company. The project performed a flowsheet of bench scale conversion of uranium oxide (UO2) into 1 ton of UF4 per year, also known as Green Salt. It is an early step in an enrichment process, beyond the capacity or scope of the Uranium Ore Concentration (UOC) plant. According to the IAEA report, KM Company designed and built a turnkey (flowsheet). The document also referred to the project concerning the missile re-entry vehicle. However, Iran answered that the flowsheets and allegations were baseless and fabrications, and the only project that the KM Company worked on was the UOC plant.\n\nThe IAEA has also reported the Iranian testing of multiple high-explosive detonators designs and documents the layout for an underground nuclear blast test facility in this university.\nIn 2006, a senior US official revealed the Washington Post a diagram being schematically consistent with a nuclear test-site schematic in Iran.<ref name=washingtonpost>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/07/AR2006020702126_pf.html\n|title=Nuclear Case Against Iran\n|accessdate=2006-02-08\n|work=Washington Post\n| first=Dafna\n| last=Linzer}}</ref> Later in 2006, a contingent of senior officers from Iran travelled to North Korea to see an underground facility to test explosion. IAEA also made question about the Iranian [[Shahab-3]] missile designs. Specifically, re-entry vehicle designs are believed to be engineered for the ability to carry nuclear warheads.\n\nThe various scientific research groups of Iran's nuclear program, run from this university under the direction of the [[IRGC]], are including efforts to obtain training courses and software on spark gaps, shock wave software, neutron sources, special steel parts, radiation measurement equipment, including borehole spectrometers. Nonetheless, Iran answered that it sought PAM shock software to study [[aircraft]], collision of cars, [[airbag]]s and for the design of [[seatbelt]]s.<ref name=IAEA/>\n\n===Biological Research Center===\nThe [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS) made a report about the biological activities in Iran, which are centered on the productions of microbial bombs using [[anthrax]], [[smallpox]] virus, [[typhoid]] fever, high dosage of [[aflatoxin]], plague microbes, and chloromicrobes, done at the Imam Hossein University in Tehran.

Five public Universities, one private university (Azad University Science and Research Branch), and one college (Civil Aviation Technology College) provide higher education and research in aerospace engineering.\n<ref name=pakalumni>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pakalumni.com/profiles/blog/show?id=1119293%3ABlogPost%3A64819\n|title=The Emerging Iranian Space Program\n|accessdate=2009-04-12\n|publisher=Ameer Alam in PakAluimni Worldwide}}</ref>\n\nIran started its scientific aerospace cooperation with [[China]] following the establishment of its Aerospace Organization in 2000. China has successfully launched forty satellites since 1996. In May 2005, Iran signed a regional research cooperation with China for the designing and launching satellites for long distance surveillance, subterranean resources, agrometeorology, and aerospace training at Iranian universities. Iran's Aerospace Organization's has been getting engaged in designing and manufacturing of a small multi-mission satellite with [[China]] and [[Thailand]] since 2005.<ref name=payvand>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/05/may/1157.html\n|title=Iran and China survey ground for aerospace cooperation\n|accessdate=2005-05-20\n|publisher=Payvand's Iran News}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1990s, Iran started to develop a launch vehicle based on [[Shahab-3]]. The Shahab-3 is a liquid-fueled single-stage missile. The Iran Space Research Center started testing launch capabilities since early 2007 reaching 150\u2013200&nbsp;km altitude. These rockets were based on [[Shahab-3]] series and were typically equipped with wind, air and temperature instruments. In August 2008, Iran developed a two-stage launch vehicle [[Safir-1]] which launched a dummy satellite. On February 2009, Iran launched a satellite named [[Omid]] into orbit using the domestically built launch vehicle [[Safir-2]], thus becoming the 9th nation to do so on [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country]]. Their Aerospace engineering achievement appears as the country has been under nearly 30 years of sanctions.<ref name=pakalumni/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\">\nFile:Imam Hossein University Library 2.jpg|Main Campus\nFile:Imam Hossein University Campus 2.jpg|\nFile:Imam_Hossein_University_Campus_4.jpg|\nFile:Imam_Hossein_University_Campus_5.jpg|\nFile:Imam Hossein University Library.jpg|Central Library\n</gallery>\n\n==Academic profile==\nThe Imam Hossein University has 33 postgraduate programs and 9 PhD programs approved by [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.ihu.ac.ir/?q=fa/node/1|title=Imam Hossein University, Introduction|publisher=Imam Hossein University|accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref>\n\n===Postgraduate programs===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Logistics\n* Strategic Information Intelligence\n* Strategic Defense Studies\n* Military Geography\n* Cell and Molecular Biology Sciences\n* Organic Chemistry\n* Analytical Chemistry\n* Physical Chemistry\n* Inorganic Chemistry\n* Nuclear Physics\n* Electrical Engineering (Electronics)\n* Mechanical Systems Engineering (Applied Design)\n* Telecommunication Engineering (Coding Theory)\n* Mechanical Engineering (Applied Design)\n* Aerospace Engineering (Aerodynamics)\n* Aerospace Engineering (Aircraft Structures)\n* Spacecraft propulsion (Liquid-propellant rocket)\n* Spacecraft propulsion (Solid-fuel rocket)\n* Systems Sciences\n* Atomic, Molecular, and Optical  Physics     \n* Crisis Management\n* Defense Management (Education)\n* Defense Management (Human Resources)\n* Defense Management (Logistics and Commerce)\n* Defense Management (Finance and Accounting)\n* Defense Management (Navy)\n* Defense Management (Army)\n* Defense Management (Special Force)\n* Defense Management ([[Basij]] Force)\n* Defense Management (Air Force)\n* Civil Defense (Design)\n* Civil Defense (Aircraft Structures)\n* Civil Defense (Cooperative Cyber Defense)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Doctoral programs===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Aerospace Mechanical Engineering (Applied Design)\n* Industrial Engineering (Systems Engineering Research)\n* Molecular Biotechnology\n* Laser Physics\n* Applied Mathematics (Coding Theory)\n* Sociometry\n* Crisis Management\n* Military Intelligence\n* Security Intelligence\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Publications===\nA number of journals and books are published by Imam Hossein University.

During the [[Iranian Revolution]], the garrison fell to Revolutionaries after a fight in which several officers of the guard were killed. The site was later on converted to a research facility. The Lavizan Technical Site includes faculties of installations industries and metallurgy. According to a document, the alleged Iranian nuclear warheads were being stored in the Lavizan military camp in the Teheran area in 1992. Another document discusses the production of a solid fuel missile prototype completed in Lavizan.<ref name=Lavizan1>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/lavizan.htm\n|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)\n|accessdate=2004-09-11\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref>\n\nA satellite image of 10 May 2004 showed that Iran had almost totally razed part of the Lavizan Technical Research Center.<ref name=Lavizan1/> It showed Iran had been demolishing buildings at Lavizan. The Lavizan Center had imported a whole-body counter (WBC), a device used to identify and measure the radioactive material in the body of human beings and animals.  On 29 June 2004, El Baradei said that Iran had accepted that the alleged concealed nuclear site in Tehran was a military-research complex before it was razed.<ref name=Lavizan1/> The Iranian authorities stated that this was a physics institute later on turned to be a biotechnology research and development center.\n\n===Aerospace Industries Organization===\n[[Iran Aviation Industries Organization|Aerospace Industries Organization]] (AIO) is a leading industrial subsidiary of the Ministry of Defense. More than 13 large factories with over 10,000 expert personnel are occupied in manufacturing a vast variety of military and non-military purposes.<ref name=Lavizan1/> Products include different types of weapons such as [[guns]], [[rocket]]s, [[missiles]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], [[bomb]]s, [[rocket]] launchers, field kitchens, [[gyroscopes]], transportation means, police equipment, and [[helmets]]. Engineering services include precision machining, metal forming, software services, quality control test, dimensional measurement, [[CNC]] machine, and [[Coordinate Measuring Machine]] (CMM).\n\nThe Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO), also known as the Sanam Industrial Group, is the Defense Industries Organization (DIO) Missile Industries Group. Sanam Industries Group is said to be the lead organization for the development of the [[Shahab-3]] missile. In 1998, [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]] had reportedly negotiated an agreement with Sanam Industries Group to provide telemetry infrastructure for Iran's [[Shahab-3]] and [[Shahab-4]] ballistic missile.<ref name=Lavizan1/>\n\n[[Baltic State Technical University]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] has allegedly contracted with the Sanam Industrial group to train Iranian students in order to design long-range solid fuel rocket boosters. They together created a center known as Persepolis as part of a contract concluded in 1996. On 22 June 1998, Iranian students were expelled from Baltic State Technical University as part of Russia's international obligations to control the spread of missile technology.<ref name=Lavizan1/>\n\nIn addition to military products, the Sanam Industrial Group also produces non-military products to convene domestic and export markets demands including TVs, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, various types of grinding wheels, stainless steel dishes, industrial fans, motor pumps, and automotive parts. The Sanam Washing Machine use Korean SAMSUNG technology, by which it becomes a powerful, economic and durable washing machine. Sanam Industrial Group in Parchin is licensed by the Italian company [[Lombardini S.r.l.|Lombardini]] to fabricate internal combustion engines, that are used in automotive, agricultural, industrial and marine applications.<ref name=Lavizan1/>\n\n===Parchin site===\n[[Parchin]] Complex, 30 kilometers southeast of Tehran, was the site for the implementation of a variety of defense projects. Parchin was the center of the Defense Industries Organization's (DIO) Chemical industry, and, possibly, the home of the main producers of the Iran\u2019s missiles. Parchin was opened in 1939, and was in operation since before the Second World War.<ref name=Parchin2>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/parchin.htm\n|title=Parchin\n|accessdate=2004-09-11\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref> Very few information was available about the post-Revolutionary Iranian arms industry. On 25 August 1999, it included the Parchin Chemical Factories (PCF). PCF was equipped with modern technology producing various commercial explosives, and chemical material.\n\nParchin is one of Iran's major chemical weapons facilities, along with the facilities located at [[Damghan]], [[Esfahan]] and [[Qazvin]]. US intelligence said Iran has been continuing to improve and develop its chemical warfare production infrastructure and munitions arsenal until 2003.<ref name=Parchin2/> US intelligence reporting Iran tries to dual-use facilities could quickly field chemical agents, but are not mainly active in military. It made also question the character of the facilities at Parchin.<ref name=Parchin2/>\n\nOn 29 December 2003, the Wall Street Journal reported that, [[Ahmad Shirzad]], a deputy from the city of Isfahan, stated that there was a large nuclear underground facility in Parchin.<ref name=benadorassociates>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.benadorassociates.com/article/789\n|title=The Meaning of Iranian Inspections.\n|accessdate=2003-12-19\n|publisher=Wall Street Journal }}</ref>\nIn an article in the Washington Times, on 7 March 2004, claimed that Iran's nuclear weapons program included use of Belarus-Russian filtering and high-temperature melting technologies for uranium enrichment.<ref name=WashingtonTimes>{{cite web\n|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/06/20040306-102129-4558r/\n|title=Iran's nuclear menace\n|accessdate=2004-03-07\n|publisher=Washington Post}}</ref> The accurate technique supposedly involved was unclear, but would appear to have been thermal diffusion.\n\nThe generally Parchin institute represents the chief center of Iran's military industry, so a nuclear program would by now include all the proficiency required within commuting distance. The suspect area was physically isolated from other components, which implies that it was not part of the ammo, chemical or missile programs. The United States made also questions whether Iran is testing high explosives at Parchin.<ref name=Parchin1>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/parchin-2.htm\n|title=Parchin Nuclear Facility\n|accessdate=2008-07-01\n|publisher=Global Security}}</ref> Nonetheless, [[Hossein Mousavian]], Iran's chief delegate to the [[IAEA]], rejected all claims about a nuclear testing area at Parchin. He categorically denied any nuclear activities in Parchin. He accused the US of deliberately using misinformation to embarrass Iran at [[IAEA]] hearings.<ref name=Parchin1/>\n\nJay C. Davis, former head of the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] at the [[US Department of Defense]], said neither the design of the facility nor the nature of the tests is unique to nuclear weapons. Davis added that environmental sampling done by [[IAEA]] inspectors could detect the presence of by-products used in the testing of high explosives for a nuclear weapon.<ref name=Parchin1/>  On 17 September 2004 [[IAEA]] head [[El Baradei]] said his organization had found no sign of nuclear-related activity at the Parchin site in Iran, which several US officials had said might be to secret nuclear weapons research. Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Parchin military site in the interests of transparency, but the visit was limited to only few areas.\n\nOn 1 March 2005, Iran abandoned a second request by the [[IAEA]] to visit again the Parchin site. However, the IAEA was eventually allowed entrance to the Parchin facility in November 2005.<ref name=Parchin1/> The [[IAEA]] did not observe any unusual activities in the buildings visited, and the results of the analysis of environmental samples did not indicate the presence of nuclear material.<ref name=Parchin1/>\n\n==Notable alumni and staff==\n{{See also|Category:Imam Hossein University

The Persian king [[Kavadh I]] needed money to pay his debts to the [[Hephthalites]] who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes in the flow of the [[Tigris]] in [[Lower Mesopotamia]], sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.<ref>Procopius.

It was the first major conflict between the two powers since 440, and would be the prelude to a long [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|series of destructive conflicts]] between the two empires over the next century.\n\n==Prelude==\nSeveral factors underlay the termination of the longest period of peace the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] ever enjoyed. The Persian king [[Kavadh I]] needed money to pay his debts to the [[Hephthalites]] who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes in the flow of the [[Tigris]] in [[Lower Mesopotamia]], sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.<ref>Procopius.
