The town is attractive and conveniently laid out, with a colorful history and a castle dating back to medieval times, close proximity to the sea, undulating farmlands and deep forests. The Department of Biology and Environmental Science in Kalmar has special competence in the area of life, health and the environment and is recognized for excellence in teaching and research across a range of natural sciences and related disciplines. The School offers Master\u2019s programmes which equip the graduate for work in industry or future studies towards a PhD.\n\n=== V\u00e4xj\u00f6 ===\nV\u00e4xj\u00f6, is a central community in the south of Sweden, with a full range of cultural and musical life in its many museums, theaters, cathedrals and concert halls. The House of Emigrants commemorates the great emigration epoch from 1850 to 1930, when 1.3 million Swedes emigrated to America. The region is also known for its high tech industry, pulp and paper manufacturing, and home of the furniture manufacturer, IKEA. The surrounding pristine lakes and forests are an attraction for those who love wildlife and the outdoors. V\u00e4xj\u00f6 has also been one of the leading tennis cities in the world as Mats Wilander, Stefan Edberg, Magnus Larsson and Jonas Bjorkman have all trained and played here. V\u00e4xj\u00f6 is easily accessible from Copenhagen and Stockholm by plane and train.\n\nThe campus is located just outside V\u00e4xj\u00f6 city center. It was designed in the American campus style, meaning that all teaching premises are within walking distance. The campus was built with the environment in mind, for it borders a nature conservation area.\n\nThere are 3,700 student apartments and dorm rooms on the university campus housing approximately 4,600-5,200 students. A part of the university campus is dedicated to the Videum Science Park. The park gives space to over 100 companies, thus being in close proximity with the university and encouraging innovation and research.\n\nTeaching premises and accommodation stand side by side on the campus. There are also restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, a sports centre and a variety of service facilities. The campus offers a safe, relaxed environment despite the high level of activity. It is bordered by meadows, a nature conservation area, a lake with bird-watching towers, and [[Teleborg Castle]].\n\nNew buildings have been erected with due concern for the environment, leaving room for old trees and moss-covered boulders among the new architecture on campus. Cars have only limited access to the site, but cycle paths lead directly to the town centre and out into the beautiful countryside all around.\n\n==Department of Biology and Environmental Science==\nThe Department of Biology and Environmental Science is part of the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences. Scientists working at the department are involved in research and teaching activities in Biology, Biomedical Science, Pharmacy, Chemistry, Food Science and Environmental Science. Most of the research laboratories and classes are operated in Kalmar. It offers seven Bachelor programs (in Swedish) and four Master programs.\n\nA non-comprehensive list of the research group operating with the school include:\n* [[Applied biochemistry research group]] (Prof. Sten Ohlson)\n* [[Bioorganic and Biophysical Chemistry Laboratory]] (Prof. [[Ian A.

In 1965, The Swedish National Legislative Assembly (Riksdag) decided to locate some programmes within the fields of technology and medicine to Link\u00f6ping. In 1967 a branch of [[Stockholm University]] was placed in Link\u00f6ping, offering education within [[humanities]], [[social sciences]] and [[natural sciences]]. Two years later a unit for medical training and the Institute of Technology were established. In 1970 all activities were brought together in three faculties within the Link\u00f6ping University College: the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine and the [[Institute of Technology]]. Link\u00f6ping University was established in 1975.\n\nIn 1977 former teacher training colleges in [[Link\u00f6ping]] and [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] were transferred to Link\u00f6ping University and in 1986 the Faculty of Health Sciences was formed, based on the faculty of medicine and regional funded education in health care professions. In 1997 a campus was opened in the neighbouring city of Norrk\u00f6ping. The renowned Carl Malmsten School of Furniture (Malmstens Link\u00f6ping University) has been part of Link\u00f6ping University since 2000. After almost 60 years at the city centre, the school moved into new premises on the outskirts of Stockholm in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=History of Link\u00f6ping University | url=https://liu.se/en/article/history-of-linkoping-university | publisher=Link\u00f6ping University | accessdate=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2017 the [[gender studies]] faculty arranged a workshop where humans could [[Speed dating|speed date]] [[plant]]s and do [[yoga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://liu.se/artikel/dejta-en-vaxt-eller-yoga-ihop-med-en|title=Dejta en v\u00e4xt \u2013 eller yoga ihop med en - Link\u00f6pings universitet|website=liu.se|language=sv-SE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602215634/https://liu.se/artikel/dejta-en-vaxt-eller-yoga-ihop-med-en|archive-date=2 June 2017|url-status=|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tema.liu.se/tema-g/Posthuman/arkiv-av-kalendarium/call-for-participants-for-a-workshop-plantarium?l=en|title=Join us for: Plantarium|date=29 May 2017|website=www.tema.liu.se|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205192158/https://www.tema.liu.se/tema-g/Posthuman/arkiv-av-kalendarium/call-for-participants-for-a-workshop-plantarium?l=en|archive-date=5 December 2017|url-status=|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/ost/dejta-en-taggbuske|title=Om du vill ha s\u00e4llskap \u2013 dejta en pelargon|date=2017-06-01|website=SVT Nyheter|language=sv|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nLink\u00f6ping University pursues research and postgraduate studies within the fields of [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[humanities]], natural, educational, [[social science|social]] and [[behavioural sciences]].

In 1965, The Swedish National Legislative Assembly (Riksdag) decided to locate some programmes within the fields of technology and medicine to Link\u00f6ping. In 1967 a branch of [[Stockholm University]] was placed in Link\u00f6ping, offering education within [[humanities]], [[social sciences]] and [[natural sciences]]. Two years later a unit for medical training and the Institute of Technology were established. In 1970 all activities were brought together in three faculties within the Link\u00f6ping University College: the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine and the [[Institute of Technology]]. Link\u00f6ping University was established in 1975.\n\nIn 1977 former teacher training colleges in [[Link\u00f6ping]] and [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] were transferred to Link\u00f6ping University and in 1986 the Faculty of Health Sciences was formed, based on the faculty of medicine and regional funded education in health care professions. In 1997 a campus was opened in the neighbouring city of Norrk\u00f6ping. The renowned Carl Malmsten School of Furniture (Malmstens Link\u00f6ping University) has been part of Link\u00f6ping University since 2000. After almost 60 years at the city centre, the school moved into new premises on the outskirts of Stockholm in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=History of Link\u00f6ping University | url=https://liu.se/en/article/history-of-linkoping-university | publisher=Link\u00f6ping University | accessdate=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2017 the [[gender studies]] faculty arranged a workshop where humans could [[Speed dating|speed date]] [[Plant|plants]] and do [[yoga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://liu.se/artikel/dejta-en-vaxt-eller-yoga-ihop-med-en|title=Dejta en v\u00e4xt \u2013 eller yoga ihop med en - Link\u00f6pings universitet|website=liu.se|language=sv-SE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602215634/https://liu.se/artikel/dejta-en-vaxt-eller-yoga-ihop-med-en|archive-date=2 June 2017|url-status=|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tema.liu.se/tema-g/Posthuman/arkiv-av-kalendarium/call-for-participants-for-a-workshop-plantarium?l=en|title=Join us for: Plantarium|date=29 May 2017|website=www.tema.liu.se|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205192158/https://www.tema.liu.se/tema-g/Posthuman/arkiv-av-kalendarium/call-for-participants-for-a-workshop-plantarium?l=en|archive-date=5 December 2017|url-status=|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/ost/dejta-en-taggbuske|title=Om du vill ha s\u00e4llskap \u2013 dejta en pelargon|date=2017-06-01|website=SVT Nyheter|language=sv|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nLink\u00f6ping University pursues research and postgraduate studies within the fields of [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[humanities]], natural, educational, [[social science|social]] and [[behavioural sciences]].

A \"West Wing\" was added in 1881 for additional student accommodation and study rooms (West Ivey was damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and remains closed).

It later commemorated the dead of [[World War II]]. Exensively damaged along with Ivey West in the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]], it is now closed to the public and awaiting repair.\n* The Laboratories were built in 1929, and became the McCaskill Building, before being replaced by the School of Landscape Architecture Building in 2009. \n*The Lodge, a residence for the College Principal, was built in 1945. Until this time the Principal and his family had lived in Ivey Hall.\n\n[[File:C1954-55 Hudson Hall.jpg|thumb|Hudson Hall in the 1950s]]\n\n* The first major hall of residence on campus was Hudson Hall, named after College Principal Eric Hudson: its foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser]] in July 1949, and it opened in 1953. Hudson Hall had bed and study accommodation for 184 students. It is now largely an administration building.\n* (Lincoln University has six halls of residence, of which Hudson Hall is the oldest. Colombo Hall, Lowrie Hall and Stevens Hall all opened in 1970, with Centennial Hall opening in 1978, Lincoln University's centenary year. The newest hall of residence is Southland Hall, built in 1993.)\n* The George Forbes Building, named after former Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]], began construction in 1957 and opened in 1960. This was the College's first purpose-built library, housing 10,000 books. Over the years the library expanded, and the present high-rise building was constructed in 1975. The library eventually outgrew the Forbes Building, and the George Forbes Memorial Library has been housed in Ivey Hall since 1989.\n[[File:The Lincoln Union 1970s.jpg|thumb|Lincoln Union in the 1970s]]\n\n* Gillespie Hall, also known as the Student Union or Lincoln Union, consists of three buildings (Union, Annex, and Link) designed and built between 1962 and 1988. It was named after former Chairman [[William Gillespie (New Zealand politician)|William Gillespie]], who had died in 1960. After the 2010 earthquake it was considered earthquake prone, and has been closed since 2010.\n* The Hilgendorf Building, constructed in 1968, was designed to cater to 550 full-time students. Named after early Lincoln lecturer [[Frederick Hilgendorf|Frederick William Hilgendorf]], it was a concrete [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] building, and was badly damaged in the 2010 earthquake and closed for repair. After engineering testing it was deemed unsalvageable and was demolished in 2015.\n[[File:1976 Burns wing and lecture halls.jpg|thumb|Burns wing and lecture halls in 1976]]\n\n* The Hilgendorf's companion, the Burns Building, was constructed in a similar style, and the complex of two buildings with their lecture theatres and computer centre were often referred to as the Hilgendorf Wing and Burns Wing. Named after past Principal [[Malcolm Burns]], Burns opened in 1976.\n* The Stewart Building, which opened in 1990, is named after another past Principal, James D. Stewart. With two large lecture theatres each seating several hundred, its computerised teaching aids and audiovisual capacity were considered cutting-edge for New Zealand in 1990.\n* Built in 1990 to provide lecture and seminar space for a rapidly-increasing intake of Commerce students, the Commerce Building sits on what was the Ivey Hall gardens.\n* The cafe and dining hall Mrs O's was built in 2011 to incorporate the original dining hall building, then redesigned for earthquake safety and reopened in 2014. It is named after Mrs Joan O'Loughlin, one of Lincoln College's longest-serving staff (1966\u20131998), a cleaner and tea attendant much-loved by students.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:1968 Ivey Hall A2004-029-8-11-33.jpg|Ivey Hall in 1968\nFile:Lodge, Lincoln MRD 1.jpeg|The Lodge\nFile:1967 Hilgendorf wing.jpg|Hilgendorf Building\nFile:Hudson MRD 3.jpeg|Hudson Hall\nFile:Forbes MRD.jpeg|Forbes Building\nFile:Commerce Building MRD 3.jpeg|Commerce Building\nFile:SoLA Building 003.jpg|School of Landscape Architecture\nFile:Mrs O's MRD 2.jpeg|Mrs O's\n</gallery>\n\n==Academic units==\n* Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce: accounting, business management, economics, farm management, finance, marketing and property studies.<ref name=agribusiness>{{cite web|title=Agribusiness and Commerce|url=http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Agribusiness-and-Commerce/|website=lincoln.ac.nz|publisher=Lincoln University|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n* Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences: agronomy, plant science, crop physiology, pasture production, animal science, systems biology, computational modelling, food and wine science, entomology; plant pathology and crop protection; ecology, conservation and wildlife management; evolution, molecular genetics and biodiversity.<ref name=lifesciences>{{cite web|title=Agriculture and Life Sciences|url=http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Agriculture-and-Life-Sciences|website=lincoln.ac.nz|publisher=Lincoln University|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n* Faculty of Environment, Society and Design: natural resources and complex systems engineering, environmental design, resource planning, transport studies, landscape architecture, M\u0101ori and [[indigenous planning]] and development, recreation management, social sciences, tourism, communication and exercise science.<ref name=envirosociety>{{cite web|title=Environmental Society and Design|url=http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Environment-Society-and-Design1|website=lincoln.ac.nz|publisher=Lincoln University|accessdate=18 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141223/http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Environment-Society-and-Design1|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n{{Main|Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection}}\n[[File:LU MRD A D Lowe.jpg|thumb|Studying wheat aphids in the early '70s]]\nLincoln University has had an [[Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection|Entomology Research Collection]] since the late 1960s, which is now the third-largest entomology collection in New Zealand, containing approximately 500,000 specimens and about 60 [[Holotype|types]].\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| QS_W = 319 | QS_W_ref = <ref>[https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/lincoln-university#wur QS World University Rankings 2018]</ref>\n| THE_W = 401\u2013500 | THE_W_ref = <ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/lincoln-university?ranking-dataset=589595 THE World University Rankings 2018]</ref>\n| ARWU_W = 601\u2013700 | ARWU_W_ref = <ref>[http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017Candidates.html Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017]</ref>\n}}\n\nThe New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission's first [[Performance Based Research Fund]] ranking exercise in 2003\u2014equivalent to the United Kingdom's [[Research Assessment Exercise]]\u2014ranked the quality of Lincoln University's research at sixth place.

As well as lecture theatres, laboratories, and a museum, the College Director [[William Ivey (agricultural scientist)|William Ivey]], his family, and the students resided here. A \"West Wing\" was added in 1881 for additional student accommodation and study rooms (West Ivey was damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and remains closed). Extensively remodelled and expanded in 1989, Ivey Hall now houses the George Forbes Memorial Library.\n* Memorial Hall, designed by [[Cecil Wood (architect)|Cecil Wood]], was built in 1923\u201324 to commemorate the loss of former Lincoln students who died in [[World War I]]; two thirds of the costs were raised by the Old Boy's Students' Association. It later commemorated the dead of [[World War II]]. Exensively damaged along with Ivey West in the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]], it is now closed to the public and awaiting repair.\n* The Laboratories were built in 1929, and became the McCaskill Building, before being replaced by the School of Landscape Architecture Building in 2009. \n*The Lodge, a residence for the College Principal, was built in 1945. Until this time the Principal and his family had lived in Ivey Hall.\n\n[[File:C1954-55 Hudson Hall.jpg|thumb|Hudson Hall in the 1950s]]\n\n* The first major hall of residence on campus was Hudson Hall, named after College Principal Eric Hudson: its foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser]] in July 1949, and it opened in 1953. Hudson Hall had bed and study accommodation for 184 students. It is now largely an administration building.\n\n* (Lincoln University has six halls of residence, of which Hudson Hall is the oldest. Colombo Hall, Lowrie Hall and Stevens Hall all opened in 1970, with Centennial Hall opening in 1978, Lincoln University's centenary year. The newest hall of residence is Southland Hall, built in 1993.)\n\n* The George Forbes Building, named after former Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]], began construction in 1957 and opened in 1960. This was the College's first purpose-built library, housing 10,000 books. Over the years the library expanded, and the present high-rise building was constructed in 1975. The library eventually outgrew the Forbes Building, and the George Forbes Memorial Library has been housed in Ivey Hall since 1989.\n[[File:The Lincoln Union 1970s.jpg|thumb|Lincoln Union in the 1970s]]\n\n* Gillespie Hall, also known as the Student Union or Lincoln Union, consists of three buildings (Union, Annex, and Link) designed and built between 1962 and 1988. It was named after former Chairman [[William Gillespie (New Zealand politician)|William Gillespie]], who had died in 1960. After the 2010 earthquake it was considered earthquake prone, and has been closed since 2010.\n\n* The Hilgendorf Building, constructed in 1968, was designed to cater to 550 full-time students. Named after early Lincoln lecturer [[Frederick Hilgendorf|Frederick William Hilgendorf]], it was a concrete [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] building, and was badly damaged in the 2010 earthquake and closed for repair. After engineering testing it was deemed unsalvageable and was demolished in 2015.\n[[File:1976 Burns wing and lecture halls.jpg|thumb|Burns wing and lecture halls in 1976]]\n\n* The Hilgendorf's companion, the Burns Building, was constructed in a similar style, and the complex of two buildings with their lecture theatres and computer centre were often referred to as the Hilgendorf Wing and Burns Wing. Named after past Principal [[Malcolm Burns]], Burns opened in 1976.\n\n* The Stewart Building, which opened in 1990, is named after another past Principal, James D. Stewart. With two large lecture theatres each seating several hundred, its computerised teaching aids and audiovisual capacity were considered cutting-edge for New Zealand in 1990.\n\n* Built in 1990 to provide lecture and seminar space for a rapidly-increasing intake of Commerce students, the Commerce Building sits on what was the Ivey Hall gardens.\n\n* The cafe and dining hall Mrs O's was built in 2011 to incorporate the original dining hall building, then redesigned for earthquake safety and reopened in 2014. It is named after Mrs Joan O'Loughlin, one of Lincoln College's longest-serving staff (1966\u20131998), a cleaner and tea attendant much-loved by students.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:1968 Ivey Hall A2004-029-8-11-33.jpg|Ivey Hall in 1968\nFile:Lodge, Lincoln MRD 1.jpeg|The Lodge\nFile:1967 Hilgendorf wing.jpg|Hilgendorf Building\nFile:Hudson MRD 3.jpeg|Hudson Hall\nFile:Forbes MRD.jpeg|Forbes Building\nFile:Commerce Building MRD 3.jpeg|Commerce Building\nFile:SoLA Building 003.jpg|School of Landscape Architecture\nFile:Mrs O's MRD 2.jpeg|Mrs O's\n</gallery>\n\n==Academic units==\n* Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce: accounting, business management, economics, farm management, finance, marketing and property studies.<ref name=agribusiness>{{cite web|title=Agribusiness and Commerce|url=http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Agribusiness-and-Commerce/|website=lincoln.ac.nz|publisher=Lincoln University|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n* Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences: agronomy, plant science, crop physiology, pasture production, animal science, systems biology, computational modelling, food and wine science, entomology; plant pathology and crop protection; ecology, conservation and wildlife management; evolution, molecular genetics and biodiversity.<ref name=lifesciences>{{cite web|title=Agriculture and Life Sciences|url=http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Agriculture-and-Life-Sciences|website=lincoln.ac.nz|publisher=Lincoln University|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n* Faculty of Environment, Society and Design: natural resources and complex systems engineering, environmental design, resource planning, transport studies, landscape architecture, M\u0101ori and [[indigenous planning]] and development, recreation management, social sciences, tourism, communication and exercise science.<ref name=envirosociety>{{cite web|title=Environmental Society and Design|url=http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Environment-Society-and-Design1|website=lincoln.ac.nz|publisher=Lincoln University|accessdate=18 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141223/http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln/Faculties-and-Divisions/Faculty-of-Environment-Society-and-Design1|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n{{Main|Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection}}\n[[File:LU MRD A D Lowe.jpg|thumb|Studying wheat aphids in the early '70s]]\nLincoln University has had an [[Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection|Entomology Research Collection]] since the late 1960s, which is now the third-largest entomology collection in New Zealand, containing approximately 500,000 specimens and about 60 [[Holotype|types]].\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| QS_W = 319 | QS_W_ref = <ref>[https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/lincoln-university#wur QS World University Rankings 2018]</ref>\n| THE_W = 401\u2013500 | THE_W_ref = <ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/lincoln-university?ranking-dataset=589595 THE World University Rankings 2018]</ref>\n| ARWU_W = 601\u2013700 | ARWU_W_ref = <ref>[http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017Candidates.html Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017]</ref>\n}}\n\nThe New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission's first [[Performance Based Research Fund]] ranking exercise in 2003\u2014equivalent to the United Kingdom's [[Research Assessment Exercise]]\u2014ranked the quality of Lincoln University's research at sixth place.

The project was considered something of a risky venture, because it was not based on a well-known franchise like many children's television programs, such as ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' or ''[[Paddington Bear]]''. The series was immediately shipped to PBS member stations at the suggestion of PBS, but all originally passed at the time. In October 1995, Jim Coane met Marjorie Kalins, senior VP of programming and production at Children's Television Workshop, and showed her the idea for the series. Kalins, who loved the idea, brought the series to Children's Television Workshop, who agreed to a partnership with the Columbia TriStar Television Group. Kalins helped him and Columbia TriStar Television obtain an $8.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. The grant proposal was written by Wesley Eure.<ref name=\"kidscreen\">{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/1999/10/01/26892-19991001/|title=Dragon Tales|first=Theresa|last=Dillon|date=October 1, 1999|accessdate=February 28, 2017|publisher=[[Playback (magazine)#Kidscreen|Kidscreen]]}}</ref> Coane stated that there was never any consideration of trying to shop the program to a commercial broadcast network and that PBS was, in his mind, the only destination for the program.<ref name=\"Don't tell kids\">{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/715869/Dont-tell-kids-Dragon-Tales-is-a-show-thats-good-for-them.html|title=Don't tell kids 'Dragon Tales' is a show that's good for them|first=Scott|last=Pierce|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=September 3, 1999|accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> As Columbia TriStar was the TV division of two major Hollywood [[Columbia Pictures|film]] [[TriStar Pictures|studios]], which in turn are owned by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] division of Japanese multinational conglomerate [[Sony]], ''Dragon Tales'' became one of the few [[PBS Kids]] and [[Sprout (TV network)|Sprout]] programs to be co-produced by a major Hollywood studio's TV subsidiary; The other PBS shows were ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' (made by [[Walt Disney Television]]) and ''[[Curious George (TV series)|Curious George]]'' (produced by [[Universal Television]]). In 2002, C-T was renamed to [[Sony Pictures Television]], a company that would co-produce the third season of the program.\n\nAfter a tour of the lot of Sony Studios, Wesley Eure created the first treatment of the show, including the initial conception of the two-headed dragon Zak and Wheezie, back then known as \"Snarf and Bugger.\" The series received a massive multi-million dollar grant from the federal government, beating out ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' for the request. As part of the conditions for the grant, Eure was required to create a companion series for the program, which he titled ''Show and Tell Me'', based on his own lecture series known as \"Anyone Can Write a Book.\" Though the companion series was never actually created, Eure remains hopeful that it will one day be produced. Eure's name was not included in the initial credits for the series, forcing him to hire an attorney to ensure that he received credit.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wesleyeure.com/Wesley_Eure/Dragon_Tales.html|title=Dragon Tales - Wesley Eure|accessdate=March 13, 2017|first=Wesley|last=Eure}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the development of a [[Bible (screenwriting)|show bible]] by Jeffrey Scott, with some tweaks by writers Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser, the series was ordered for just over 60 eleven-minute episodes by PBS. Scott was assigned to write and edit half, with Ruby/Lesser assigned to the other half. At this point, the writing team was provided with a document titled \"FUN AND LEARNING IN DRAGON LAND: A Writer\u2019s Guide to Dragon Tales Educational Content\" which provided directives as to which curriculum should be included within the stories, such as \"emotional challenges > understanding other people\u2019s emotions > recognizing and labeling feelings in others\" and the statement that \"CURRICULUM IS PARAMOUNT!\"  After the creation of the first script, all writing parties involved agreed that the scripts \"weren\u2019t fun or funny, they were flat and boring.\" The writers successfully explained to the consultants, educators and psychologists of PBS that children watch television to be entertained and must be entertained in order to be educated. They were then provided with a new directive, \"Come up with entertaining stories and shoehorn in the curriculum wherever it fits!\" Scott states that from the experience he learned an invaluable lesson about how to create a successful preschool series.<ref name=\"entertainfirst\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/blog/formula-successful-preschool-series-entertain-first-educate-last|title= FORMULA FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRESCHOOL SERIES: ENTERTAIN FIRST, EDUCATE LAST - A Dragon Tale: How an Emmy-nominated PBS preschool series almost died at birth...|first=Jeffrey|last=Scott|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=January 14, 2017|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> [[Dong Woo Animation]], [[Rough Draft Korea]], [[Sunwoo Entertainment]], [[Wang Film Productions]] (season 1 only), [[Yearim]], and lotto animation contributed some of the animation for this series.\n\n===Show premise and overview===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 15em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = left\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = ''Dragon Tales'' has three primary educational goals.

Befriended by four friendly talking dragons with distinctive personalities, Ord, Cassie, Zak, and Wheezie, they frequently travel to Dragon Land and help their friends in fulfilling particular quests, assisting them in their daily problems, and learning important morals through their experiences with Dragon Land.\n\nDesigned to educate preschoolers mildly in Hispanic culture, a new character named Enrique debuted during the show's final season, providing the series with a third protagonist. Surrounded by a variety of unique characters and faced with numerous differing situations, Emmy and Max commonly embark on adventures with their dragon friends, conquering fears or achieving goals in spite of any obstacles preventing them from doing so.\n\nAs a series broadcast on PBS, the program had an educational focus, combining lessons of a pro-social nature with those of more general educational value. Educational themes covered included identifying shapes, learning words and letters in both English and Spanish, counting and basic math. Social themes were also covered, such as good sportsmanship, the importance of being a good friend, overcoming obstacles such as jealousy or fears and getting along with siblings. Many of the show's interstitial song segments, known as \"Dragon Tunes,\" also covered such themes, such as \"Make It Fun\", which encouraged viewers to not complain about having to do seemingly mundane chores such as washing dishes or helping parents with cooking meals, but instead find ways to make them fun. Another, \"Hum,\" encouraged those who had a fear of the dark or trying new things to hum a gentle tune to comfort them. Stated goals of the program's educational philosophy included the encouragement of pursuing new experiences, finding ways to approach and learn from challenges and that learning can come through trying and not succeeding.<ref name=\"ephilosophy\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175138/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Educational Philosophy}}</ref> Despite two of the show's human leads, Emmy and Enrique, being six years old, the show's described target audience was children closer to the age of four.<ref name=\"target\">Scott, Jeffrey.

In \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon,\" Cassie felt jealous of her little brother, Finn, when he gets everyone's attention when she takes him to school for \"[[circle time]].\" Discussing the matter with her best friend, Emmy, and her teacher, Quetzal, helps her to understand that jealousy is a natural feeling that everyone experiences sometimes, but that there are ways that she can appreciate her brother, while still feeling appreciated herself.<ref name=\"greeneyed\">''Dragon Tales'' story - Season 2 - \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon\"</ref> In \"Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os, Enrique,\" Enrique feels sad and homesick for his homeland of Colombia when his birthday celebrations in Dragon Land aren't like the traditions of those back in his old home.

She\u2019s Max's older sister. Her best friend is Cassie, and she\u2019s perhaps known for saying, \"Definitely!\" whenever a good idea arises. Though Emmy isn\u2019t ashamed to do \"girly\" things with Cassie, she\u2019s also heavily into sports and games and generally is up for any activity regardless of traditional gender roles. Though she experiences occasional jealousy of her brother, the two are otherwise usually together within Dragon Land and share many adventures. Though a brave, smart natural leader, she\u2019s also impulsive and doesn\u2019t always think before she acts. She\u2019s typically seen wearing a blue button-up dress over a red short sleeve shirt.<ref name=\"chardesc\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175122/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Character Descriptions}}</ref>\n\n===Max===\nMaximilian \"Max\", voiced by [[Danny McKinnon]], is 4-years-old,<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Dragon-Tales/side-by-side/</ref> and is Emmy's younger brother. For the most part, he and Emmy get along fine, but occasionally have arguments due to him being prone to anger. His best friend is Ord. Though Max loves Emmy, he sometimes struggles with being the younger brother, and is usually frustrated about being too little to do certain things, or when Emmy acts in certain ways. He\u2019s of an adventurous sort and sometimes helps to give courage to Ord when he's afraid of certain things. He\u2019s kind to others, but often enjoys acting silly or goofy. He sometimes acts in a stubborn manner, determined to prove that a child his age can do things on his own, even when he really needs help. He usually wears a green short-sleeved shirt with yellow on the collar & edges of the shirt-sleeves and brown slacks.<ref name=\"chardesc\" /> Max was named after the son of executive producer Jim Coane.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\" />\n\n===Enrique===\nEnrique, voiced by Aida Ortega, is 6-years-old. He\u2019s Emmy and Max's new friend and next-door neighbor who moved from [[Colombia]] to the United States and also once lived in Puerto Rico. He\u2019s raised by his father and his grandmother (\"''abuelita''\") <ref name=\"officialfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|accessdate=March 7, 2017|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213062357/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He first appears in the Season 3 episode, To Fly With A New Friend, and travels to Dragon Land with the children when Max encourages Emmy to share their secret, despite Emmy's reluctance. His recent experiences in South America provide more opportunities for the characters to demonstrate the meanings of new Spanish words.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nHe rides with Zak and Wheezie, the two-headed dragon who rarely flew with any human friends prior to Enrique's debut in Season 3.\nHES the worst character ever in history. \nHis personality is somewhat bashful, missing his homeland of Colombia and sometimes shy to join in on new experiences and saddened by reminders of times from his old home. However, he finds that he enjoys himself when he allows himself to let go, express his feelings and then move forward to have fun. He\u2019s raised by his grandparents and described as an intensely smart and logical character. A series of moves throughout his early life has left him jaded and wary of both making new friends and trying new things. He normally wears a bright yellow short-sleeved shirt and blue jeans.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nThe presence of Enrique on the program, in conjunction with Max and Emmy, was the subject of a study \"'They Are?!' Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales,\" which was critical of the show's use of the characters, feeling that the series ultimately \"undermines multiculturalism because it fails to nurture children's ability to live fearlessly with and within difference.\"<ref name=\"theyare\">{{cite web|title=\"They Are?!\": Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales|year=2009|url=http://citeweb.info/20092083465 | doi=10.1177/1532708608325936|first=Phillip|last=Serrato|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Ord===\nOrd, voiced by [[Ty Olsson]], is a strong blue male dragon who\u2019s Max\u2019s best friend. He\u2019s extremely fond of food and always carries some just in case; a running gag in the show features Ord making \"Dragon Corn\" by throwing the kernels in the air and popping them with his fire breath. He\u2019s also allergic to dandelions. Despite his physical strength, Ord is afraid of almost everything, particularly darkness and thunder, and possesses a magical tendency to turn invisible when he is upset or frightened. Ord's sun-shaped Dragon Badge glows when he faces his fears.<ref name=\"sproutchar\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|title=Sprout Online - ''Dragon Tales'' - Parents - \"Who are the main characters in the series?\"|accessdate=March 7, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213025018/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Cassie===\nCassie, voiced by [[Chantal Strand]], is a shy, cute, demure and sweet pink female dragon and Emmy's best friend. She possesses a magical tendency to shrink when unhappy, may occasionally come across as slightly insecure and uncertain, and is prone to worrying. However, Cassie is distinguished by her maternal sweetness as a result of her responsibilities as an older sister and babysitter to a humongous myriad of younger siblings, and has been shown to be gifted with great singing and dancing abilities. Cassie also is characterized by her color combination consisting of pink and yellow, albeit her body is spotted with blue speckles in some areas. Cassie knows just about everything there is to know about Dragon Land and has a deep love of fairy-tales, both stemming from her love of reading. Her dragon badge glows when she feels confident, but she often worries about making a mistake.<ref name=\"ctwcassie\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|title=Dragontales - characters - \"Meet Cassie!\"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000620023542/http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|archive-date=June 20, 2000|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Zak and Wheezie===\nZak and Wheezie, voiced by Jason Michas and [[Kathleen Barr]], are [[conjoined twin]] dragons with opposite personalities; Zak (green) is male, and Wheezie (purple) is female. Zak is neat and clean, worries a lot, and is pessimistic about many things. His catchphrase is \"Take it easy, Wheezie!\", which he often says when Wheezie takes off running, dragging him with her. Wheezie, on the other hand, is bold, hyper, and free-spirited, with a tendency to be messy, much to her brother's annoyance. Her catchphrase is \"Love it!\", when she loves something. The two have a shared love of music and performing and they often perform in talent shows and recitals together.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" />\n\nZak and Wheezie always fly with Enrique, although prior to his debut, Zak and Wheezie rarely flew with any of their human friends. Their dragon badges glow when they work together and get along, though will sometimes glow independently when one of them accomplishes something on their own of significance. Although they fight a lot, they are very close and care about each other a lot.\n\n===Quetzal===\nQuetzal, portrayed by [[Eli Gabay]], is an elderly dragon who\u2019s the teacher at The School in the Sky where young dragons attend. He has an [[Twin|identical twin]] brother named Fernando who works in his garden. Quetzal typically speaks with a Mexican accent and is named after the Aztec deity [[Quetzalcoatl]]. He tries to encourage his students to find solutions to their problems on their own, but is a sounding board who offers stability and comfort, as well as sound advice.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" /> In the episode 'Snow Dragon,' Quetzal mentions it has been hundreds of years since he visited the dragon snow sculpture as a child, implying he is centuries old.\n\n===Other characters===\nEach of the following have appeared more than once:\n* Arlo, a dragon who works at the Dragon Dump, he has a machine at the Dragon Dump which he calls his \"lil' ol' recycler\" that sorts out things that can be used again.

It is home to numerous colorful, anthropomorphic dragons and many other fantastical creatures. Max and Emmy travel to Dragon Land  by holding an enchanted dragon scale while reciting the rhyme: \"I wish, I wish, with all my heart, to fly with dragons in a land apart.\" The scale then teleports them to Dragon Land. It appears that it does not matter who does or does not say the rhyme, as long as at least one person says it; whoever is holding the dragon scale while they say the rhyme will be teleported with them. Returning home from Dragon Land is done in the same fashion, although no dragon scale is needed. The rhyme is: \"I wish, I wish, to use this rhyme, to go back home until next time.\" The person reciting the rhyme, as well as all those holding their hand, will be transported back to where the reciter said the rhyme that took them to Dragon Land.\n*Basketball Court \u2013 For one episode, Emmy and Max and the dragons come here for a game of basketball.\n*Chile Valley \u2013 A valley with lots of tasty, yet spicy chilly peppers, which are red in color and resemble dragonberries.\n*The Cloud Factory \u2013 Where a dragon named Polly Nimbus manufactures rain clouds, snow clouds, etc., and ejects them into the sky as needed.\n*Crystal Cave \u2013 A giant, crystallized cave where crystals are stored and special crystals dance, with the aid of water from Singing Springs, and some Dandelion fuzzies from the Dandelion Forest.\n*Crystal Fountain \u2013 A fountain inside Crystal Cave for cleaning.\n*Dandelion Forest \u2013 A forest made of dandelions that actually roar and growl like real lions, and are as tall as trees.

Ord is very afraid of this forest because of its darkness and other things that inhabit this strange Forest.\n*The Knuckerhole \u2013 Zak & Wheezie's home. Of course, there are also lots of other knuckerholes all over Dragonland.\n*Lost Forever Hole \u2013 A small tunnel formed by a river.

In the first half, they discovered Ord's missing tooth, while the adventures continued in the second story with Ord facing his fear of the dark. A total of forty episodes were aired in the first season, with the finale airing on April 28, 2000. The show's second season premiered on June 4, 2001 and had 25 episodes. 20 of these episodes were broadcast from June 4, 2001 to September 20, 2001. The final installment of this set, \"Just the Two of Us / Cowboy Max,\" was broadcast only in non-U.S. markets such as Guam and Canada and did not premiere to U.S. audiences until the program's third season, though \"Cowboy Max\" was released on DVD prior to this. The special \"Let's Start a Band!,\" featuring the dragon characters blended with live humans in a musical show based on the program's \"Dragon Tunes\" segments, was released on March 2, 2003. Following this, no new episodes were aired until February 21, 2005, leading many long-time viewers to believe the program had been quietly canceled. The new season introduced the new character Enrique, an immigrant from Colombia, as well as an updated focus on folk songs and teaching of Spanish. The premiere installment, in two parts, showed Enrique being introduced to the sights and sounds of Dragon Lands, learning to fly on Zak & Wheezie, and having his first adventure. The second half appeared as \"The Mystery of the Missing Knuckerholes\" in some listings, but on the program was simply titled as Part 2 of the episode. Though 29 episodes were broadcast, including \"Just the Two of Us / Cowboy Max,\" only one story from each was original, while the others were a repeat of a story from the second season. The series officially concluded with the \"Big, Big Friends Day\" special on November 25, 2005.\n\nThe program's first musical album, ''Dragon Tunes'', was released on March 20, 2001 and featured the character themes of Cassie and Ord, as well as tunes such as \"Betcha Can,\" the \"Wiggle Song\" and \"Shake Your Dragon Tail.\"<ref name=\"tunes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Tunes-Brian-Garland/dp/B00005A09V/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1417007873&sr=1-1&keywords=dragon+tunes|title=Amazon - ''Dragon Tunes''|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> A second album, ''More Dragon Tunes'', was issued on February 15, 2005.

The program was stated to use \"messages built into the children's series to inform parental challenges. From bedtime dramatics to tantrums and assorted other small-fry rebellions...\" For the special, parents were given video cameras used to record problematic behavior, then counselors analyzed the video footage and provided specific tips to the parents, who all reported significantly improved behavior two months later. The researchers also discovered from their work on the series that children often think in pictures and that visual aids are often helpful.<ref name=\"notjustforkids\">{{cite news|last=Mason|first=M.S.|date=June 15, 2001|title=These children's television shows aren't just for the kids.|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|volume=93|issue=141}}</ref>\n\n===International airing===\n''Dragon Tales'' has also been shown on television in many countries around the world and dubbed into several different languages.

The songs were released on the albums ''Dragon Tunes''<ref name=\"tunes\" /> and ''More Dragon Tunes''.<ref name=\"moretunes\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Dragon Tales episodes}}\n{{:List of Dragon Tales episodes}}\n\n''Dragon Tales'' aired a total of 93 episodes, 40 in its first season, 24 in its second season and 29 in its third season. Each episode featured two original stories, aired back-to-back, split by the interstitial song segment \"Dragon Tunes,\" all of which were eventually released on the show's music albums. Almost all episodes from the third season, however, generally contained at least one repeat of a story from the program's second season and some were even repeats of material from that season and earlier material from the third season. In all, there were a total of 155 original stories. The show also had two specials: ''Let's Start a Band'' and ''Big, Big Friend Day''. ''Let's Start a Band'' was a musical feature in which the characters of the show were seen alongside real human children. ''Big, Big Friend Day'', however, was merely a special featuring episodes of ''Dragon Tales'' and ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', with interstitial segments introducing characters from the new series ''[[It's a Big Big World]]''. As such, it did not contain any original ''Dragon Tales'' material.<ref name=\"tvcomepisodes\" />\n\n==Reception==\nThe series has received generally positive reviews (although the third season's reception was more mixed).{{Attribution needed|date=January 2020}} [[Common Sense Media]] rated the show a 4 out of 5 stars stating: ''Dragon Tales'' intends to positively impact a child's growth and development by encouraging a love of learning and helping children problem-solve and work through the challenges of growing up. The kids and dragons embark on different adventures and attend the School in the Sky, all while learning how to face their fears and handle new situations. The fun, nurturing, and sometimes challenging atmosphere of Dragon Land is a lot like preschool.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/dragon-tales|title=Dragon Tales - TV Review|date=May 10, 2006|website=www.commonsensemedia.org}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n*2000 [[Parent's Choice Award|Parents' Choice Silver Award Winner]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=881&award=xx&from=Children%20Television%20Workshop|title=Dragon Tales|publisher=Parents' Choice|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref>\n*2001 Parents' Choice Approved Award Winner (for \"Dragon Tales: Dragon Tunes\" CD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=4284&award=xx&from=Kid%20Rhino|title=Dragon Tales: Dragon Tunes|publisher=Parents' Choice|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref>\n*2003 Parents' Choice Silver Award Winner (for \"Let's Start a Band\" video)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=12308&award=xx&from=Sesame%20Workshop|title=Dragon Tales \"Let's Start a Band\"|publisher=Parents' Choice|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref>\n*2005 Parents' Choice Approved Award Winner (for \"Dragon Tales: More Dragon Tunes\" CD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=17645&award=xx&from=Kid%20Rhino|title=Dragon Tales: More Dragon Tunes|publisher=Parents' Choice|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe series was nominated for three [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s for Outstanding Children's Animated Program in 2001, 2002 and 2003, but did not win any.

The project was considered something of a risky venture, because it was not based on a well-known franchise like many children's television programs, such as ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' or ''[[Paddington Bear]]''. The series was immediately shipped to PBS member stations at the suggestion of PBS, but all originally passed at the time. In October 1995, Jim Coane met Marjorie Kalins, senior VP of programming and production at Children's Television Workshop, and showed her the idea for the series. Kalins, who loved the idea, brought the series to Children's Television Workshop, who agreed to a partnership with the Columbia TriStar Television Group. Kalins helped him and Columbia TriStar Television obtain an $8.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. The grant proposal was written by Wesley Eure.<ref name=\"kidscreen\">{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/1999/10/01/26892-19991001/|title=Dragon Tales|first=Theresa|last=Dillon|date=October 1, 1999|accessdate=February 28, 2017|publisher=[[Playback (magazine)#Kidscreen|Kidscreen]]}}</ref> Coane stated that there was never any consideration of trying to shop the program to a commercial broadcast network and that PBS was, in his mind, the only destination for the program.<ref name=\"Don't tell kids\">{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/715869/Dont-tell-kids-Dragon-Tales-is-a-show-thats-good-for-them.html|title=Don't tell kids 'Dragon Tales' is a show that's good for them|first=Scott|last=Pierce|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=September 3, 1999|accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> As Columbia TriStar was the TV division of two major Hollywood [[Columbia Pictures|film]] [[TriStar Pictures|studios]], which in turn are owned by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] division of Japanese multinational conglomerate [[Sony]], ''Dragon Tales'' became one of the few [[PBS Kids]] and [[Sprout (TV network)|Sprout]] programs to be co-produced by a major Hollywood studio's TV subsidiary; The other PBS shows were ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' (made by [[Walt Disney Television]]) and ''[[Curious George (TV series)|Curious George]]'' (produced by [[Universal Television]]). In 2002, C-T was renamed to [[Sony Pictures Television]], a company that would co-produce the third season of the program.\n\nAfter a tour of the lot of Sony Studios, Wesley Eure created the first treatment of the show, including the initial conception of the two-headed dragon Zak and Wheezie, back then known as \"Snarf and Bugger.\" The series received a massive multi-million dollar grant from the federal government, beating out ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]'' for the request. As part of the conditions for the grant, Eure was required to create a companion series for the program, which he titled ''Show and Tell Me'', based on his own lecture series known as \"Anyone Can Write a Book.\" Though the companion series was never actually created, Eure remains hopeful that it will one day be produced. Eure's name was not included in the initial credits for the series, forcing him to hire an attorney to ensure that he received credit.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wesleyeure.com/Wesley_Eure/Dragon_Tales.html|title=Dragon Tales - Wesley Eure|accessdate=March 13, 2017|first=Wesley|last=Eure}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the development of a [[Bible (screenwriting)|show bible]] by Jeffrey Scott, with some tweaks by writers Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser, the series was ordered for just over 60 eleven-minute episodes by PBS. Scott was assigned to write and edit half, with Ruby/Lesser assigned to the other half. At this point, the writing team was provided with a document titled \"FUN AND LEARNING IN DRAGON LAND: A Writer\u2019s Guide to Dragon Tales Educational Content\" which provided directives as to which curriculum should be included within the stories, such as \"emotional challenges > understanding other people\u2019s emotions > recognizing and labeling feelings in others\" and the statement that \"CURRICULUM IS PARAMOUNT!\"  After the creation of the first script, all writing parties involved agreed that the scripts \"weren\u2019t fun or funny, they were flat and boring.\" The writers successfully explained to the consultants, educators and psychologists of PBS that children watch television to be entertained and must be entertained in order to be educated. They were then provided with a new directive, \"Come up with entertaining stories and shoehorn in the curriculum wherever it fits!\" Scott states that from the experience he learned an invaluable lesson about how to create a successful preschool series.<ref name=\"entertainfirst\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/blog/formula-successful-preschool-series-entertain-first-educate-last|title= FORMULA FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRESCHOOL SERIES: ENTERTAIN FIRST, EDUCATE LAST - A Dragon Tale: How an Emmy-nominated PBS preschool series almost died at birth...|first=Jeffrey|last=Scott|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=January 14, 2017|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> [[Dong Woo Animation]], [[Rough Draft Korea]], [[Sunwoo Entertainment]], [[Wang Film Productions]] (season 1 only), [[Yearim]], and lotto animation contributed some of the animation for this series.\n\n===Show premise and overview===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 15em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = left\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = ''Dragon Tales'' has three primary educational goals.

Befriended by four friendly talking dragons with distinctive personalities, Ord, Cassie, Zak, and Wheezie, they frequently travel to Dragon Land and help their friends in fulfilling particular quests, assisting them in their daily problems, and learning important morals through their experiences with Dragon Land.\n\nDesigned to educate preschoolers mildly in Hispanic culture, a new character named Enrique debuted during the show's final season, providing the series with a third protagonist. Surrounded by a variety of unique characters and faced with numerous differing situations, Emmy and Max commonly embark on adventures with their dragon friends, conquering fears or achieving goals in spite of any obstacles preventing them from doing so.\n\nAs a series broadcast on PBS, the program had an educational focus, combining lessons of a pro-social nature with those of more general educational value. Educational themes covered included identifying shapes, learning words and letters in both English and Spanish, counting and basic math. Social themes were also covered, such as good sportsmanship, the importance of being a good friend, overcoming obstacles such as jealousy or fears and getting along with siblings. Many of the show's interstitial song segments, known as \"Dragon Tunes,\" also covered such themes, such as \"Make It Fun\", which encouraged viewers to not complain about having to do seemingly mundane chores such as washing dishes or helping parents with cooking meals, but instead find ways to make them fun. Another, \"Hum,\" encouraged those who had a fear of the dark or trying new things to hum a gentle tune to comfort them. Stated goals of the program's educational philosophy included the encouragement of pursuing new experiences, finding ways to approach and learn from challenges and that learning can come through trying and not succeeding.<ref name=\"ephilosophy\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175138/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/educational_philosophy.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Educational Philosophy}}</ref> Despite two of the show's human leads, Emmy and Enrique, being six years old, the show's described target audience was children closer to the age of four.<ref name=\"target\">Scott, Jeffrey.

In \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon,\" Cassie felt jealous of her little brother, Finn, when he gets everyone's attention when she takes him to school for \"[[circle time]].\" Discussing the matter with her best friend, Emmy, and her teacher, Quetzal, helps her to understand that jealousy is a natural feeling that everyone experiences sometimes, but that there are ways that she can appreciate her brother, while still feeling appreciated herself.<ref name=\"greeneyed\">''Dragon Tales'' story - Season 2 - \"Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon\"</ref> In \"Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os, Enrique,\" Enrique feels sad and homesick for his homeland of Colombia when his birthday celebrations in Dragon Land aren't like the traditions of those back in his old home.

She\u2019s Max's older sister. Her best friend is Cassie, and she\u2019s perhaps known for saying, \"Definitely!\" whenever a good idea arises. Though Emmy isn\u2019t ashamed to do \"girly\" things with Cassie, she\u2019s also heavily into sports and games and generally is up for any activity regardless of traditional gender roles. Though she experiences occasional jealousy of her brother, the two are otherwise usually together within Dragon Land and share many adventures. Though a brave, smart natural leader, she\u2019s also impulsive and doesn\u2019t always think before she acts. She\u2019s typically seen wearing a blue button-up dress over a red short sleeve shirt.<ref name=\"chardesc\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308175122/http://pbskids.org/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archive-date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2014|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Character Descriptions}}</ref>\n\n===Max===\nMaximilian \"Max\", voiced by [[Danny McKinnon]], is 4-years-old,<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Dragon-Tales/side-by-side/</ref> and is Emmy's younger brother. For the most part, he and Emmy get along fine, but occasionally have arguments due to him being prone to anger. His best friend is Ord. Though Max loves Emmy, he sometimes struggles with being the younger brother, and is usually frustrated about being too little to do certain things, or when Emmy acts in certain ways. He\u2019s of an adventurous sort and sometimes helps to give courage to Ord when he's afraid of certain things. He\u2019s kind to others, but often enjoys acting silly or goofy. He sometimes acts in a stubborn manner, determined to prove that a child his age can do things on his own, even when he really needs help. He usually wears a green short-sleeved shirt with yellow on the collar & edges of the shirt-sleeves and brown slacks.<ref name=\"chardesc\" /> Max was named after the son of executive producer Jim Coane.<ref name=\"eurewebsite\" />\n\n===Enrique===\nEnrique, voiced by Aida Ortega, is 6-years-old. He\u2019s Emmy and Max's new friend and next-door neighbor who moved from [[Colombia]] to the United States and also once lived in Puerto Rico. He\u2019s raised by his father and his grandmother (\"''abuelita''\") <ref name=\"officialfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|accessdate=March 7, 2017|title=Parents & Teachers - ''Dragon Tales'' - Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213062357/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/faq_general.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He first appears in the Season 3 episode, To Fly With A New Friend, and travels to Dragon Land with the children when Max encourages Emmy to share their secret, despite Emmy's reluctance. His recent experiences in South America provide more opportunities for the characters to demonstrate the meanings of new Spanish words.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nHe rides with Zak and Wheezie, the two-headed dragon who rarely flew with any human friends prior to Enrique's debut in Season 3.\n\nHis personality is somewhat bashful, missing his homeland of Colombia and sometimes shy to join in on new experiences and saddened by reminders of times from his old home. However, he finds that he enjoys himself when he allows himself to let go, express his feelings and then move forward to have fun. He\u2019s raised by his grandparents and described as an intensely smart and logical character. A series of moves throughout his early life has left him jaded and wary of both making new friends and trying new things. He normally wears a bright yellow short-sleeved shirt and blue jeans.<ref name=\"officialfaq\" />\n\nThe presence of Enrique on the program, in conjunction with Max and Emmy, was the subject of a study \"'They Are?!' Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales,\" which was critical of the show's use of the characters, feeling that the series ultimately \"undermines multiculturalism because it fails to nurture children's ability to live fearlessly with and within difference.\"<ref name=\"theyare\">{{cite web|title=\"They Are?!\": Latino Difference vis-\u00e0-vis Dragon Tales|year=2009|url=http://citeweb.info/20092083465 | doi=10.1177/1532708608325936|first=Phillip|last=Serrato|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Ord===\nOrd, voiced by [[Ty Olsson]], is a strong blue male dragon who\u2019s Max\u2019s best friend. He\u2019s extremely fond of food and always carries some just in case; a running gag in the show features Ord making \"Dragon Corn\" by throwing the kernels in the air and popping them with his fire breath. He\u2019s also allergic to dandelions. Despite his physical strength, Ord is afraid of almost everything, particularly darkness and thunder, and possesses a magical tendency to turn invisible when he is upset or frightened. Ord's sun-shaped Dragon Badge glows when he faces his fears.<ref name=\"sproutchar\">{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|title=Sprout Online - ''Dragon Tales'' - Parents - \"Who are the main characters in the series?\"|accessdate=March 7, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213025018/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/dragontales/parentsteachers/character_descriptions.html|archivedate=December 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Cassie===\nCassie, voiced by [[Chantal Strand]], is a shy, cute, demure and sweet pink female dragon and Emmy's best friend. She possesses a magical tendency to shrink when unhappy, may occasionally come across as slightly insecure and uncertain, and is prone to worrying. However, Cassie is distinguished by her maternal sweetness as a result of her responsibilities as an older sister and babysitter to a humongous myriad of younger siblings, and has been shown to be gifted with great singing and dancing abilities. Cassie also is characterized by her color combination consisting of pink and yellow, albeit her body is spotted with blue speckles in some areas. Cassie knows just about everything there is to know about Dragon Land and has a deep love of fairy-tales, both stemming from her love of reading. Her dragon badge glows when she feels confident, but she often worries about making a mistake.<ref name=\"ctwcassie\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|title=Dragontales - characters - \"Meet Cassie!\"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000620023542/http://www.ctw.org/preschool/dragontales/characters/0,4278,cassie,00.html|archive-date=June 20, 2000|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Zak and Wheezie===\nZak and Wheezie, voiced by Jason Michas and [[Kathleen Barr]], are [[conjoined twin]] dragons with opposite personalities; Zak (green) is male, and Wheezie (purple) is female. Zak is neat and clean, worries a lot, and is pessimistic about many things. His catchphrase is \"Take it easy, Wheezie!\", which he often says when Wheezie takes off running, dragging him with her. Wheezie, on the other hand, is bold, hyper, and free-spirited, with a tendency to be messy, much to her brother's annoyance. Her catchphrase is \"Love it!\", when she loves something. The two have a shared love of music and performing and they often perform in talent shows and recitals together.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" />\n\nZak and Wheezie always fly with Enrique, although prior to his debut, Zak and Wheezie rarely flew with any of their human friends. Their dragon badges glow when they work together and get along, though will sometimes glow independently when one of them accomplishes something on their own of significance. Although they fight a lot, they are very close and care about each other a lot.\n\n===Quetzal===\nQuetzal, portrayed by [[Eli Gabay]], is an elderly dragon who\u2019s the teacher at The School in the Sky where young dragons attend. He has an [[Twin|identical twin]] brother named Fernando who works in his garden. Quetzal typically speaks with a Mexican accent and is named after the Aztec deity [[Quetzalcoatl]]. He tries to encourage his students to find solutions to their problems on their own, but is a sounding board who offers stability and comfort, as well as sound advice.<ref name=\"sproutchar\" /> In the episode 'Snow Dragon,' Quetzal mentions it has been hundreds of years since he visited the dragon snow sculpture as a child, implying he is centuries old.\n\n===Other characters===\nEach of the following have appeared more than once:\n* Arlo, a dragon who works at the Dragon Dump, he has a machine at the Dragon Dump which he calls his \"lil' ol' recycler\" that sorts out things that can be used again.

It is home to numerous colorful, anthropomorphic dragons and many other fantastical creatures. Max and Emmy travel to Dragon Land  by holding an enchanted dragon scale while reciting the rhyme: \"I wish, I wish, with all my heart, to fly with dragons in a land apart.\" The scale then teleports them to Dragon Land. It appears that it does not matter who does or does not say the rhyme, as long as at least one person says it; whoever is holding the dragon scale while they say the rhyme will be teleported with them. Returning home from Dragon Land is done in the same fashion, although no dragon scale is needed. The rhyme is: \"I wish, I wish, to use this rhyme, to go back home until next time.\" The person reciting the rhyme, as well as all those holding their hand, will be transported back to where the reciter said the rhyme that took them to Dragon Land.\n*Basketball Court \u2013 For one episode, Emmy and Max and the dragons come here for a game of basketball.\n*Chile Valley \u2013 A valley with lots of tasty, yet spicy chilly peppers, which are red in color and resemble dragonberries.\n*The Cloud Factory \u2013 Where a dragon named Polly Nimbus manufactures rain clouds, snow clouds, etc., and ejects them into the sky as needed.\n*Crystal Cave \u2013 A giant, crystallized cave where crystals are stored and special crystals dance, with the aid of water from Singing Springs, and some Dandelion fuzzies from the Dandelion Forest.\n*Crystal Fountain \u2013 A fountain inside Crystal Cave for cleaning.\n*Dandelion Forest \u2013 A forest made of dandelions that actually roar and growl like real lions, and are as tall as trees.

Ord is very afraid of this forest because of its darkness and other things that inhabit this strange Forest.\n*The Knuckerhole \u2013 Zak & Wheezie's home. Of course, there are also lots of other knuckerholes all over Dragonland.\n*Lost Forever Hole \u2013 A small tunnel formed by a river.

In the first half, they discovered Ord's missing tooth, while the adventures continued in the second story with Ord facing his fear of the dark. A total of forty episodes were aired in the first season, with the finale airing on April 28, 2000. The show's second season premiered on June 4, 2001 and had 25 episodes. 20 of these episodes were broadcast from June 4, 2001 to September 20, 2001. The final installment of this set, \"Just the Two of Us / Cowboy Max,\" was broadcast only in non-U.S. markets such as Guam and Canada and did not premiere to U.S. audiences until the program's third season, though \"Cowboy Max\" was released on DVD prior to this. The special \"Let's Start a Band!,\" featuring the dragon characters blended with live humans in a musical show based on the program's \"Dragon Tunes\" segments, was released on March 2, 2003. Following this, no new episodes were aired until February 21, 2005, leading many long-time viewers to believe the program had been quietly canceled. The new season introduced the new character Enrique, an immigrant from Colombia, as well as an updated focus on folk songs and teaching of Spanish. The premiere installment, in two parts, showed Enrique being introduced to the sights and sounds of Dragon Lands, learning to fly on Zak & Wheezie, and having his first adventure. The second half appeared as \"The Mystery of the Missing Knuckerholes\" in some listings, but on the program was simply titled as Part 2 of the episode. Though 29 episodes were broadcast, including \"Just the Two of Us / Cowboy Max,\" only one story from each was original, while the others were a repeat of a story from the second season.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

It indicates a [[Crash (computing)|system crash]], in which the [[operating system]] has reached a condition where it can no longer operate safely.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BSoD in Windows 1.0.png|thumb|A blue screen, as appears on [[Windows 1.0]], [[Windows 2.0|2.0]], and [[Windows 3.0|3.0]].|right]]\n[[File:Windows NT BSOD at GVA baggage claim, 1999-10-03.jpg|thumb|A [[Windows NT 4.0]] BSoD, seen on a baggage claim monitor in [[Geneva Airport]] (1999)|left]]\n[[File:Blue Screen of Death on Windows XP on a drugstore - 2019-09-03.jpg|thumb|Blue Screen of Death on Windows XP on a drugstore in 2019|left]]\n[[File:BSOD @ BNA.jpg|thumb|Windows 98 BSOD on [[Nashville International Airport]].|left]]\n[[File:BSOD in the CNIT.JPG|thumb|Windows XP BSOD in [[CNIT]].]]\n[[File:BSOD V\u00e9lo'v.jpg|thumb|Windows 7 BSOD on [[V\u00e9lo'v]].]]\nBSoDs have been around since [[Windows 1.0]]. In Windows 1.0-3.0, if the system crashed, the OS would give a blue screen with white text listing loaded kernel modules and their respective memory address, including the module that caused the kernel fault. It appears as a blue screen with white letters telling of a problem. BSoDs have been present in [[Windows NT 3.1]] (the first version of the [[Windows NT]] family, released in 1993) and all Windows operating systems released afterwards. (See [[History of Microsoft Windows]].) BSoDs can be caused by poorly written [[device driver]]s or malfunctioning hardware, such as faulty [[Computer memory|memory]], power supply issues, overheating of components, or hardware running beyond its specification limits. In the [[Windows 9x]] era, incompatible [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]] or bugs in the operating system [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] could also cause BSoDs. Because of the instability and lack of memory protection in Windows 9x, BSoDs were much more common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Incorrect attribution===\nOn 4 September 2014, several

This is usually caused by an [[General protection fault|illegal operation]] being performed. The only safe action the operating system can take in this situation is to [[triple fault|restart the computer]]. As a result, data may be lost, as users are not given an opportunity to save data that has not yet been saved to the hard drive.\n\nThe text on the error screen contains the code of the error and its symbolic name (e.g. \"0x0000001E, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED\") along with four error-dependent values in parentheses that are there to help software engineers fix the problem that occurred. Depending on the error code, it may display the address where the problem occurred, along with the driver which is loaded at that address. Under Windows NT, the second and third sections of the screen may contain information on all loaded drivers and a stack dump, respectively. The driver information is in three columns; the first lists the base address of the driver, the second lists the driver's creation date (as a [[Unix time]]stamp), and the third lists the name of the driver.<ref>{{cite book | title=Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit | publisher=[[Microsoft Press]] | date=29 October 1996 | edition=1st | location=Redmond, WA | isbn=1-57231-343-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftwindow00micr }}</ref>[[File:Reactos bsod2.png|thumb|[[ReactOS]], an attempt at creating a [[free and open-source]] implementation of a Windows NT-compatible [[operating system]], also features its own BSoD similar to the one in the Windows NT family.]]By default, Windows will create a [[core dump|memory dump]] file when a stop error occurs. Depending on the OS version, there may be several formats this can be saved in, ranging from a 64kB \"minidump\" (introduced in Windows 2000) to a \"complete dump\" which is effectively a copy of the entire contents of physical memory ([[RAM]]). The resulting memory dump file may be debugged later, using a kernel [[debugger]]. For Windows WinDBG or KD debuggers from [[WinDbg|Debugging Tools for Windows]] are used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn745912(v=vs.85).aspx|title=Getting Started with WinDbg (Kernel-Mode)|last=DOMARS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref> A debugger is necessary to obtain a [[call stack|stack]] trace, and may be required to ascertain the true cause of the problem; as the information on-screen is limited and thus possibly misleading, it may hide the true source of the error. By default, Windows XP is configured to save only a 64kB minidump when it encounters a stop error, and to then automatically reboot the computer. Because this process happens very quickly, the blue screen may be seen only for an instant or not at all. Users have sometimes noted this as a [[Booting#Random reboot|random reboot]] rather than a traditional stop error, and are only aware of an issue after Windows reboots and displays a notification that it has recovered from a serious error. This happens only when the computer has a function called \"Auto Restart\" enabled, which can be disabled in the Control Panel which in turn shows the stop error.\n\nMicrosoft Windows can also be configured to send live debugging information to a kernel debugger running on a separate [[computer]]. If a stop error is encountered while a live kernel debugger is attached to the system, Windows will halt execution and cause the debugger to break in, rather than displaying the BSoD. The debugger can then be used to examine the contents of memory and determine the source of the problem.\n\nA BSoD can also be caused by a critical boot loader error, where the operating system is unable to access the boot partition due to incorrect storage drivers, a damaged file system or similar problems. The error code in this situation is STOP 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2673509/you-receive-error-stop-error-code-0x0000007b-inaccessible-boot-device|title=Stop error code 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE)|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=support.microsoft.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> In such cases, there is no memory dump saved. Since the system is unable to boot from the hard drive in this situation, correction of the problem often requires using the repair tools found on the Windows installation disc.\n\n===Details===\nBefore [[Windows Server 2012]], each BSoD displayed an error name in uppercase (e.g. APC_INDEX_MISMATCH), a hexadecimal error number (e.g. 0x00000001) and four parameters. The last two are shown together in the following format:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms818748.aspx|title=STOP: 0x00000001 (parameter, parameter, parameter, parameter) APC_INDEX_MIS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|error code (parameter 1, parameter 2, parameter 3, parameter 4) error name}}\n\nDepending on the error number and its nature, all, some, or even none of the parameters contain data pertaining to what went wrong, and/or where it happened. In addition, the error screens showed four paragraphs of general explanation and advice and may have included other technical data such the file name of the culprit and memory addresses.\n\nWith the release of Windows Server 2012, the BSoD was changed, removing all of the above in favor of the error name, and a concise description. Windows 8 added a sad emoticon as well. The hexadecimal error code and parameters can still be found in the [[Event Viewer|Windows Event Log]] or in [[memory dump]]s. Since Windows 10 Build 14393, Windows 10 has added [[QR code]] for quick troubleshooting.\n\n==Windows 9x==\n<!-- Windows ME is also Windows 9x -->\n[[File:Windows 9X BSOD.png|thumb|right|A blue screen of death, as appears on [[Windows 9x]]]]\nThe blue screen of death frequently occurs in Microsoft's home desktop operating systems [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98|98]], and [[Windows ME|ME]]. In these operating systems, the BSoD is the main way for [[VxD|virtual device drivers]] to report errors to the user. It is internally referred to by the name of \"<code>_VWIN32_FaultPopup</code>\". A Windows 9x BSoD gives the user the option either to restart or continue.\n\nThe most common BSoD is on an 80\u00d725 screen which is the operating system's way of reporting an interrupt caused by a processor exception; it is a more serious form of the [[general protection fault]] dialog boxes. The memory address of the error is given and the error type is a hexadecimal number from 00 to 11 (0 to 17 decimal). The error codes are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|title=What Are Fatal Exception Errors|last=|first=|date=19 January 2007|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823202532/http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|archive-date=23 August 2003|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>\n* 00: Division [[Trap (computing)|fault]]\n* 01: Startup Error\n* 02: [[Non-maskable interrupt|Non-Maskable Interrupt]]\n* 03: Shutdown Error\n* 04: Overflow Trap\n* 05: Bounds Check Fault\n* 06: Invalid Opcode Fault\n* 07: \"[[Coprocessor]] Not Available\" Fault \n* 08: Double Fault\n* 09: Coprocessor Segment Overrun\n* 0A: Invalid Task State [[Segmentation fault|Segment Fault]]\n* 0B: Not Present Fault\n* 0C: Stack Fault\n* 0D: General Protection Fault\n* 0E: Page Fault\n* 0F: Error Message Limit Exceed\n* 10: Coprocessor Error Fault\n* 11: Alignment Check Fault\n\nReasons for BSoDs include:\n* Problems that occur with incompatible versions of [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]: Windows loads these DLLs into memory when they are needed by application programs; if versions are changed, the next time an application loads the DLL it may be different from what the application expects. These incompatibilities increase over time as more new software is installed, and is one of the main reasons why a freshly installed copy of Windows is more stable than an \"old\" one.\n* Faulty or poorly written [[device driver]]s\n* Hardware incompatibilities\nDamaged hardware may also cause a BSoD.\n\nIn Windows 95 and 98, a BSoD occurs when the system attempts to access the file \"<code>c:\\con\\con</code>\" or \"<code>c:\\aux\\aux</code>\" on the hard drive. This could be inserted on a website to crash visitors' machines.

In Windows 1.0-3.0, if the system crashed, the OS would give a blue screen with white text listing loaded kernel modules and their respective memory address, including the module that caused the kernel fault. It appears as a blue screen with white letters telling of a problem. BSoDs have been present in [[Windows NT 3.1]] (the first version of the [[Windows NT]] family, released in 1993) and all Windows operating systems released afterwards. (See [[History of Microsoft Windows]].) BSoDs can be caused by poorly written [[device driver]]s or malfunctioning hardware, such as faulty [[Computer memory|memory]], power supply issues, overheating of components, or hardware running beyond its specification limits. In the [[Windows 9x]] era, incompatible [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]] or bugs in the operating system [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] could also cause BSoDs. Because of the instability and lack of memory protection in Windows 9x, BSoDs were much more common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Incorrect attribution===\nOn 4 September 2014, several

Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 use [[Segoe UI]] and attempt to render the BSoD at native resolution (in case of newer PCs), otherwise defaulting to 640x480 (in case of older PCs). Windows 10 versions 1607 onwards uses the same format as Windows 8, but has a [[QR code]] which leads to a Microsoft survey about how the blue screen was caused.\n\nDespite the \"blue screen\" name, in Windows 9x, the color of the message could be customized by the user.<ref>{{cite book|year=2000|author=Scott Seely|title=Windows Shell Programming|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|isbn=9780130254962|quote=BSOD stands for Blue Screen Of Death.

This is usually caused by an [[General protection fault|illegal operation]] being performed. The only safe action the operating system can take in this situation is to [[triple fault|restart the computer]]. As a result, data may be lost, as users are not given an opportunity to save data that has not yet been saved to the hard drive.\n\nThe text on the error screen contains the code of the error and its symbolic name (e.g. \"0x0000001E, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED\") along with four error-dependent values in parentheses that are there to help software engineers fix the problem that occurred. Depending on the error code, it may display the address where the problem occurred, along with the driver which is loaded at that address. Under Windows NT, the second and third sections of the screen may contain information on all loaded drivers and a stack dump, respectively. The driver information is in three columns; the first lists the base address of the driver, the second lists the driver's creation date (as a [[Unix time]]stamp), and the third lists the name of the driver.<ref>{{cite book | title=Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit | publisher=[[Microsoft Press]] | date=29 October 1996 | edition=1st | location=Redmond, WA | isbn=1-57231-343-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftwindow00micr }}</ref>[[File:Reactos bsod2.png|thumb|[[ReactOS]], an attempt at creating a [[free and open-source]] implementation of a Windows NT-compatible [[operating system]], also features its own BSoD similar to the one in the Windows NT family.]]By default, Windows will create a [[core dump|memory dump]] file when a stop error occurs. Depending on the OS version, there may be several formats this can be saved in, ranging from a 64kB \"minidump\" (introduced in Windows 2000) to a \"complete dump\" which is effectively a copy of the entire contents of physical memory ([[RAM]]). The resulting memory dump file may be debugged later, using a kernel [[debugger]]. For Windows WinDBG or KD debuggers from [[WinDbg|Debugging Tools for Windows]] are used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn745912(v=vs.85).aspx|title=Getting Started with WinDbg (Kernel-Mode)|last=DOMARS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref> A debugger is necessary to obtain a [[call stack|stack]] trace, and may be required to ascertain the true cause of the problem; as the information on-screen is limited and thus possibly misleading, it may hide the true source of the error. By default, Windows XP is configured to save only a 64kB minidump when it encounters a stop error, and to then automatically reboot the computer. Because this process happens very quickly, the blue screen may be seen only for an instant or not at all. Users have sometimes noted this as a [[Booting#Random reboot|random reboot]] rather than a traditional stop error, and are only aware of an issue after Windows reboots and displays a notification that it has recovered from a serious error. This happens only when the computer has a function called \"Auto Restart\" enabled, which can be disabled in the Control Panel which in turn shows the stop error.\n\nMicrosoft Windows can also be configured to send live debugging information to a kernel debugger running on a separate [[computer]]. If a stop error is encountered while a live kernel debugger is attached to the system, Windows will halt execution and cause the debugger to break in, rather than displaying the BSoD. The debugger can then be used to examine the contents of memory and determine the source of the problem.\n\nA BSoD can also be caused by a critical boot loader error, where the operating system is unable to access the boot partition due to incorrect storage drivers, a damaged file system or similar problems. The error code in this situation is STOP 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2673509/you-receive-error-stop-error-code-0x0000007b-inaccessible-boot-device|title=Stop error code 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE)|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=support.microsoft.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> In such cases, there is no memory dump saved. Since the system is unable to boot from the hard drive in this situation, correction of the problem often requires using the repair tools found on the Windows installation disc.\n\n===Details===\nBefore [[Windows Server 2012]], each BSoD displayed an error name in uppercase (e.g. APC_INDEX_MISMATCH), a hexadecimal error number (e.g. 0x00000001) and four parameters. The last two are shown together in the following format:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms818748.aspx|title=STOP: 0x00000001 (parameter, parameter, parameter, parameter) APC_INDEX_MIS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|error code (parameter 1, parameter 2, parameter 3, parameter 4) error name}}\n\nDepending on the error number and its nature, all, some, or even none of the parameters contain data pertaining to what went wrong, and/or where it happened. In addition, the error screens showed four paragraphs of general explanation and advice and may have included other technical data such the file name of the culprit and memory addresses.\n\nWith the release of Windows Server 2012, the BSoD was changed, removing all of the above in favor of the error name, and a concise description. Windows 8 added a sad emoticon as well. The hexadecimal error code and parameters can still be found in the [[Event Viewer|Windows Event Log]] or in [[memory dump]]s. Since Windows 10 Build 14393, Windows 10 has added [[QR code]] for quick troubleshooting.\n\n==Windows 9x==\n<!-- Windows ME is also Windows 9x -->\n[[File:Windows 9X BSOD.png|thumb|right|A blue screen of death, as appears on [[Windows 9x]]]]\nThe blue screen of death frequently occurs in Microsoft's home desktop operating systems [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98|98]], and [[Windows ME|ME]]. In these operating systems, the BSoD is the main way for [[VxD|virtual device drivers]] to report errors to the user. It is internally referred to by the name of \"<code>_VWIN32_FaultPopup</code>\". A Windows 9x BSoD gives the user the option either to restart or continue.\n\nThe most common BSoD is on an 80\u00d725 screen which is the operating system's way of reporting an interrupt caused by a processor exception; it is a more serious form of the [[general protection fault]] dialog boxes. The memory address of the error is given and the error type is a hexadecimal number from 00 to 11 (0 to 17 decimal). The error codes are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|title=What Are Fatal Exception Errors|last=|first=|date=19 January 2007|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823202532/http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|archive-date=23 August 2003|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>\n* 00: Division [[Trap (computing)|fault]]\n* 01: Startup Error\n* 02: [[Non-maskable interrupt|Non-Maskable Interrupt]]\n* 03: Shutdown Error\n* 04: Overflow Trap\n* 05: Bounds Check Fault\n* 06: Invalid Opcode Fault\n* 07: \"[[Coprocessor]] Not Available\" Fault \n* 08: Double Fault\n* 09: Coprocessor Segment Overrun\n* 0A: Invalid Task State [[Segmentation fault|Segment Fault]]\n* 0B: Not Present Fault\n* 0C: Stack Fault\n* 0D: General Protection Fault\n* 0E: Page Fault\n* 0F: Error Message Limit Exceed\n* 10: Coprocessor Error Fault\n* 11: Alignment Check Fault\n\nReasons for BSoDs include:\n* Problems that occur with incompatible versions of [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]: Windows loads these DLLs into memory when they are needed by application programs; if versions are changed, the next time an application loads the DLL it may be different from what the application expects. These incompatibilities increase over time as more new software is installed, and is one of the main reasons why a freshly installed copy of Windows is more stable than an \"old\" one.\n* Faulty or poorly written [[device driver]]s\n* Hardware incompatibilities\nDamaged hardware may also cause a BSoD.\n\nIn Windows 95 and 98, a BSoD occurs when the system attempts to access the file \"<code>c:\\con\\con</code>\" or \"<code>c:\\aux\\aux</code>\" on the hard drive. This could be inserted on a website to crash visitors' machines.
