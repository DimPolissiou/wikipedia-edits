Seiko launched the [[Ruputer]] in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).\n\nIn 1999, [[Samsung]] launched the world's first watch phone, the SPH-WP10.

Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC.

Some watches can serve as full [[GPS watch]]es, displaying maps and current coordinates, and recording tracks.  Users can \"mark\" their current location and then edit the entry's name and coordinates, which enables navigation to those new coordinates.

Functions may include training programs (such as intervals), lap times, speed display, [[GPS tracking unit]], Route tracking, [[dive computer]], [[heart rate monitor]] compatibility, [[Cadence (cycling)|Cadence]] sensor compatibility, and compatibility with sport transitions (as in [[triathlon]]s). Other watches can cooperate with an app in a [[smartphone]] to carry out their functions.  They are paired usually by [[Bluetooth]] with a smartphone.  Some of these only work with a phone that runs the same [[mobile operating system]]; others use a unique watch OS, or otherwise are able to work with most smartphones.  Paired, the watch may function as a remote to the phone.  This allows the watch to display data such as calls, SMS messages, emails, calendar invites, and any data that may be made available by relevant [[phone app]]s.

He studied chemistry, mineralogy and mining for two years in London under [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], and afterwards examined the mining districts in various parts of England, [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]].\n\nWhile in [[Cornwall]] he discovered ores of nickel and [[cobalt]] in material that had been rejected as worthless. He completed his studies under [[Robert Jameson]] and others at Edinburgh, was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1807, a member of the newly established [[Geological Society of London]] in 1808, and in the same year he returned to Ireland.\n\nIn 1809, he was appointed by the commissioners to inquire into the nature and extent of the bogs in Ireland, and the means of improving them. In 1812 he was elected Professor of Geology and Mining Engineer to the [[Royal Dublin Society]]. Shortly afterwards he expressed his intention of preparing a geological map of Ireland. During subsequent years he made many surveys and issued many reports on mineral districts in Ireland, and these formed the foundation of his first geological map of the country (1815). He also succeeded [[Richard Kirwan|Dr. Richard Kirwan]] as government inspector of mines in Ireland. In 1822 Griffith became engineer of public works in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]] and [[Limerick]], and was occupied until 1830 in repairing old roads and in laying out many miles of new roads in some of the most inaccessible parts of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1825, he was appointed by the government to carry out a boundary survey of Ireland. He was to mark the boundaries of every county, barony, civil parish and townland in preparation for the first [[Ordnance Survey]]. He was also called upon to assist in the preparation of a parliamentary Bill to provide for the general valuation of Ireland. This Act was passed in 1826, and he was appointed Commissioner of Valuation in 1827, but did not start work until 1830 when the new 6\" maps became available from the Ordnance survey and which he was required to use as provided for by statute. He continued to work on this until 1868. On [[Griffith's valuation]] the various local and public assessments were made.\n\nHis extensive investigations furnished him with ample material for improving his geological map, and the second edition was published in 1835. A third edition on a larger scale (1 in. to 4 m.) was issued under the [[Board of Ordnance]] in 1839, and it was further revised in 1855. For this work and his other services to science he was awarded the [[Wollaston medal]] by the Geological Society in 1854. In 1850 he was made chairman of the Irish Board of Works, and in 1858 he was created a baronet. \n\nAfter research in the 20th century, is now known that to a large extent the improvements of detail in the maps which Griffith was praised for and the geological research for Griffith's papers were down to [[Patrick Ganly]], whose pioneering work went entirely uncredited by Griffith.<ref name=\"Kerry Magazine\">{{cite journal|title=Patrick Ganly (1809-1899) and the discovery of way-up in rocks on the Dingle Peninsula|last1=Wyse Jackson|first1=Dr. Patrick N.|volume=7|publisher=Kerry Archaeological and Historical Society|year=1996}}</ref><ref name=\"RGS\">{{cite web|url=https://readinggeology.org.uk/docs/reports/WeekTrips/RGS_Antrim_2012_09.pdf|publisher=Special Proceedings of the Reading Geological Society|last1=Barrett|first1=Barbara|title=Field visit to Antrim, NI, 15th - 22nd September 2012|website=readinggeology.org.uk|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHe died at his residence, 2 Fitzwilliam Place in Dublin, on 22 September 1878 in his 95th year.

He was to mark the boundaries of every county, barony, civil parish and townland in preparation for the first [[Ordnance Survey]]. He was also called upon to assist in the preparation of a parliamentary Bill to provide for the general valuation of Ireland. This Act was passed in 1826, and he was appointed Commissioner of Valuation in 1827, but did not start work until 1830 when the new 6\" maps became available from the Ordnance survey and which he was required to use as provided for by statute. He continued to work on this until 1868. On [[Griffith's valuation]] the various local and public assessments were made.\n\nHis extensive investigations furnished him with ample material for improving his geological map, and the second edition was published in 1835. A third edition on a larger scale (1 in. to 4 m.) was issued under the [[Board of Ordnance]] in 1839, and it was further revised in 1855. For this work and his other services to science he was awarded the [[Wollaston medal]] by the Geological Society in 1854. In 1850 he was made chairman of the Irish Board of Works, and in 1858 he was created a baronet. \n\nAfter research in the 20th century, is now known that to a large extent the improvements of detail in the maps which Griffith was praised for and the geological research for Griffith's papers were down to [[Patrick Ganly]], whose pioneering work went entirely uncredited by Griffith.<ref name=\"Kerry Magazine\">{{cite journal|title=Patrick Ganly (1809-1899) and the discovery of way-up in rocks on the Dingle Peninsula|last1=Wyse Jackson|first1=Dr. Patrick N.|volume=7|publisher=Kerry Archaeological and Historical Society|year=1996}}</ref><ref name=\"RGS\">{{cite web|url=https://readinggeology.org.uk/docs/reports/WeekTrips/RGS_Antrim_2012_09.pdf|publisher=Special Proceedings of the Reading Geological Society|last1=Barrett|first1=Barbara|title=Field visit to Antrim, NI, 15th - 22nd September 2012|website=readinggeology.org.uk|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHe died at his residence, 2 Fitzwilliam Place in Dublin, on 22 September 1878 in his 95th year.  At the time of his death, he was the oldest surviving fellow of the Geological Society of London and was the last survivor of the long-since disbanded Royal Irish Regiment of Artillery. He was buried alongside his wife, Maria Jane (n\u00e9e Waldie m. 21 Sep 1812) in [[Mount Jerome Cemetery]], Harold's Cross, Dublin; on his grave is the epitaph: ''Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, Serving the Lord''.\n\n==Family==\n\nIn 1812 he married Maria Jane Waldie of Hendersyde Park in [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]].
