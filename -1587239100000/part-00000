It was originally released on September 17, 2013, by [[Capitol Records]] as the first promotional single from Perry's fourth [[studio album]], ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013). Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17. Both artists co-wrote the song with its producers, [[Max Martin]], [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]], and [[Dr. Luke]], alongside [[Sarah Hudson (singer)|Sarah Hudson]]. It was conceived by Perry and Hudson during a writing session in Perry's hometown of [[Santa Barbara, California]], and Juicy J was later commissioned for a verse on the song.\n\n\"Dark Horse\" combines the genres of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Electropop|electropop]], replicating what has been described as a \"[[Southern rap]]-[[techno]] mashup\". The track features a minimal production, with a \"seductive\" and \"mature\" tone to Perry's vocals, while Juicy J is featured on the song's intro and [[Rapping|rapped]] [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a \"witchy, [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]-y kind of [[black magic]]-y idea\", so she wrote it from the perspective of a [[witch]] warning a man not to [[falling in love|fall in love]] with her because if he does, she will be his last. The song was part of a competition sponsored by [[Pepsi]] in which fans could vote via [[Twitter]] on whether they would prefer either \"Dark Horse\" or \"[[Walking on Air (Katy Perry song)|Walking on Air]]\" to be released as the first promotional single from ''Prism''. \n\n\"Dark Horse\" was a commercial success, charting at number one in Canada, the [[Netherlands]] and the United States. It also reached the top ten in almost 20 countries including [[New Zealand]], United Kingdom, [[Sweden]] and [[Venezuela]] as well as the Digital Songs chart of ''Billboard'' magazine.<ref name=\"Caulfield\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5855135/beyonce-leads-for-third-week-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart |title=Beyonce Leads for Third Week at No. 1 on Billboard 200 Chart |first=Keith |last=Caulfield |work=Billboard |date=January 2, 2014 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104075520/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5855135/beyonce-leads-for-third-week-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart |archivedate=January 4, 2014 }}</ref> ''Billboard'' identified Dark Horse as cementing trap music's place on the charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2015/6804537/justin-bieber-omi-kygo-lillywood-robin-schulz-mr-probs-tropical-house-hits-2015|title=How Justin Bieber, OMI and More Helped Tropical House Heat Up in 2015|website=Billboard}}</ref> Perry first performed the song live at the 2013 [[iHeartRadio Music Festival]] in [[Las Vegas]] on September 20, 2013.

On July 29, 2019, a federal jury ruled in favor of Flame and the co-plaintiffs Da' T.R.U.T.H. and  Chike Ojukwu. The jury ordered Perry, her collaborators, and associated labels to pay $2.78 million in damages. Of this, Perry was ordered to pay $550,000. However, in part due to a similar judgement that found [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" clear of copyright infringement in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], the jury award was vacated on appeal in March 2020.\n\n==Production and release==\nInspired by the 1996 film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5763220/katy-perry-reveals-prism-influences-adds-stripped-down |title=Katy Perry Reveals 'Prism' Influences, Adds Stripped-Down Performances at Album Release Event |author=Rutherford, Kevin |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |date=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027052306/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5763220/katy-perry-reveals-prism-influences-adds-stripped-down |archivedate=October 27, 2013 }}</ref> Perry and singer-songwriter Sarah Hudson wrote the first version of \"Dark Horse\" in Perry's hometown of [[Santa Barbara, California]].<ref name=\"MTV1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1713269/katy-perry-dark-horse-prism.jhtml |title=Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' Is A 'Warning' |first=Christina |last=Garibaldi |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=August 29, 2013 |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203083356/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1713269/katy-perry-dark-horse-prism.jhtml |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> Perry described the song as a \"[[wiktionary:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]]\", as it mixed her, a [[pop music]] artist, with an \"urban kind of [[hip-hop]]-flavored background soundtrack\"; and its lyrics as \"witchy and dark\", written from the perspective of \"a witch warning [a] man to not fall in love with [her]\", and if so, she would be his last.

For the opening verses, Perry's character Katy P\u00e4tra, the witch of Memphis, is shown wearing a white dress and white and blue wig while floating on a large [[barge]] at sunset, with pyramids and palm trees visible in the background. The video transitions to a different scene where P\u00e4tra, now wearing a longer dress and a black wig, sits in an extravagant [[Sphinx]]-like throne while pharaohs gather to bring her expensive gifts (such as a large [[diamond]]) in an attempt to \"win her heart.\"\n\nAfter retrieving the first suitor's gift, she hits the man with a magical bolt of lightning from her hand, turning him into a pile of sand, and takes his jewels to wear on her teeth as a [[grill (jewelry)|grill]]. Another suitor brings her [[candy]], [[cupcake]]s, [[twinkie]]s, and spicy [[cheese puffs]]. After she burns her mouth with the spicy cheese puffs, she turns the suitor into a large cup of water, which she drinks. P\u00e4tra also appears as a gray statue in a scene where golden pythons and gray guardian statues such as [[Anubis]], [[Horus]], [[Nisroch]] and [[Apep]] surround her, and in a scene with a blue background where she wears a golden dress and several golden hieroglyphs levitate around her.\n\nDuring Juicy J's verse, the rapper emerges from a gold [[sarcophagus]] while P\u00e4tra accepts an Egyptian chariot with hydraulics (she turns the associated suitor into a set of giant dice to hang from the frame) and rejects a suitor who turns out to have the [[Sobek|face of a crocodile]] by turning him into a wallet. During the final chorus, the last suitor brings P\u00e4tra a large gold pyramid with a pink capstone, which she ascends. At the top of the pyramid, P\u00e4tra, dressed as [[Isis]], uses her powers to conjure up a magical \"perfect storm\" with pink, purple, and violet clouds. Although it seems like P\u00e4tra has finally found a gift she likes, the final frame of the video reveals that she has turned the final suitor into a [[Japanese urban legend#Jinmenken (\"Human-Faced Dog\")|dog with a human head]].\n\n===Reception===\nThe music video was criticized by some for appropriating the symbols and imagery of Egyptian culture. Cullen, the director, defended the music video, saying that, while he believes it is dangerous to rip things directly from present cultures without adding anything to them, Ancient Egypt is part of what he calls our \"shared collective mythology\". He said: \"The most important thing is that when you create something, and this is actually something Katy and I worked to do \u2014 you bring a new spin to it.\" Egyptologist [[David P. Silverman]] praised the music video's use of Egyptian imagery and the interest it could generate to viewers: \"[Egypt has] always been a part of popular culture. It encourages people to think of these things, and some of those people actually begin to learn a lot.\" The video was noted by conspiracy theorists for bearing resemblance to imagery used by the alleged [[Illuminati]], but Ritner rejected the allegations, saying that \"The many discussions of the Illuminati are nonsense\" and that, in fact, the [[Freemasonry|masonic]] imagery associated with the Illuminati is drawn from Egyptian imagery (as a common source for both).<ref name=\"TimeMagazine\" />\n\nOn June 9, 2015, the music video for \"Dark Horse\" became the first video by a female artist to reach 1 billion views on [[Vevo]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' Passes 1 Billion Vevo Views |first=Erin |last=Strecker |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6590902/katy-perry-dark-horse-1-billion-vevo-views |journal=Billboard |date=June 10, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612233806/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6590902/katy-perry-dark-horse-1-billion-vevo-views |archivedate=June 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Katy Perry Just Beat Taylor Swift To A Huge Milestone |first=Gil |last=Kaufman |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2181184/katy-perry-dark-horse-billion-video-taylor-swift/ |publisher=MTV News |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=June 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610090021/http://www.mtv.com/news/2181184/katy-perry-dark-horse-billion-video-taylor-swift/ |archivedate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> Perry also became the first female to have a video on [[YouTube]] with 1 billion views.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31487/katy-perry-just-left-taylor-swift-in-the-dust-on-youtube/ |title=Katy Perry Just Left Taylor Swift in the Dust on YouTube |magazine=[[Seventeen (American magazine)]] |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |date=June 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723153039/http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31487/katy-perry-just-left-taylor-swift-in-the-dust-on-youtube/ |archivedate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> As of March 2020, the video has received over 2.7 billion views on YouTube, making it the [[List of most viewed YouTube videos#All-time|18th most viewed video of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1000 Most Viewed YouTube Videos of All Time|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11E57E1166929B60 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809182529/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2r5g8xGajEwdXd3x1sZh8hC |archivedate=August 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Accusations of blasphemy====\nThe music video caused controversy among some [[Muslim]]s who criticized a scene in the video where a man wearing a [[pendant]] appearing to display the [[Arabic]] word for \"[[Allah]]\" is disintegrated and turned into sand by Perry's character.

It was originally released on September 17, 2013, by [[Capitol Records]] as the first promotional single from Perry's fourth [[studio album]], ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013). Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17. Both artists co-wrote the song with its producers, [[Max Martin]], [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]], and [[Dr. Luke]], alongside [[Sarah Hudson (singer)|Sarah Hudson]]. It was conceived by Perry and Hudson during a writing session in Perry's hometown of [[Santa Barbara, California]], and Juicy J was later commissioned for a verse on the song.\n\n\"Dark Horse\" combines the genres of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Electropop|electropop]], replicating what has been described as a \"[[Southern rap]]-[[techno]] mashup\". The track features a minimal production, with a \"seductive\" and \"mature\" tone to Perry's vocals, while Juicy J is featured on the song's intro and [[Rapping|rapped]] [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a \"witchy, [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]-y kind of [[black magic]]-y idea\", so she wrote it from the perspective of a [[witch]] warning a man not to [[falling in love|fall in love]] with her because if he does, she will be his last. The song was part of a competition sponsored by [[Pepsi]] in which fans could vote via [[Twitter]] on whether they would prefer either \"Dark Horse\" or \"[[Walking on Air (Katy Perry song)|Walking on Air]]\" to be released as the first promotional single from ''Prism''. \n\n\"Dark Horse\" was a commercial success, charting at number one in Canada, the [[Netherlands]] and the United States. It also reached the top ten in almost 20 countries including [[New Zealand]], United Kingdom, [[Sweden]] and [[Venezuela]] as well as the Digital Songs chart of ''Billboard'' magazine.<ref name=\"Caulfield\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5855135/beyonce-leads-for-third-week-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart |title=Beyonce Leads for Third Week at No. 1 on Billboard 200 Chart |first=Keith |last=Caulfield |work=Billboard |date=January 2, 2014 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104075520/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5855135/beyonce-leads-for-third-week-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart |archivedate=January 4, 2014 }}</ref> ''Billboard'' identified Dark Horse as cementing trap music's place on the charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2015/6804537/justin-bieber-omi-kygo-lillywood-robin-schulz-mr-probs-tropical-house-hits-2015|title=How Justin Bieber, OMI and More Helped Tropical House Heat Up in 2015|website=Billboard}}</ref> Perry first performed the song live at the 2013 [[iHeartRadio Music Festival]] in [[Las Vegas]] on September 20, 2013.

However, in part due to a similar judgement that found [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" clear of copyright infringement in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], the jury award was vacated on appeal in March 2020.\n\n==Production and release==\nInspired by the 1996 film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5763220/katy-perry-reveals-prism-influences-adds-stripped-down |title=Katy Perry Reveals 'Prism' Influences, Adds Stripped-Down Performances at Album Release Event |author=Rutherford, Kevin |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |date=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027052306/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5763220/katy-perry-reveals-prism-influences-adds-stripped-down |archivedate=October 27, 2013 }}</ref> Perry and singer-songwriter Sarah Hudson wrote the first version of \"Dark Horse\" in Perry's hometown of [[Santa Barbara, California]].<ref name=\"MTV1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1713269/katy-perry-dark-horse-prism.jhtml |title=Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' Is A 'Warning' |first=Christina |last=Garibaldi |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=August 29, 2013 |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203083356/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1713269/katy-perry-dark-horse-prism.jhtml |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> Perry described the song as a \"[[wiktionary:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]]\", as it mixed her, a [[pop music]] artist, with an \"urban kind of [[hip-hop]]-flavored background soundtrack\"; and its lyrics as \"witchy and dark\", written from the perspective of \"a witch warning [a] man to not fall in love with [her]\", and if so, she would be his last.

Speaking of Perry's concept, Cullen said \"That's music to my ears \u2014 when an artist has a couple concepts that they want to mash up to create something fresh.\"<ref name=\"TimeMagazine\">{{cite journal|last=Rothman |first=Lily |title=Katy Perry Dark Horse Music Video: Egypt Setting Gets OK from Experts |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/02/21/katy-perry-dark-horse-egypt/ |journal=Time |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223223043/http://entertainment.time.com/2014/02/21/katy-perry-dark-horse-egypt/ |archivedate=February 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Synopsis===\n[[File:Dark Horse Disintegration.png|thumb|right|The video was criticized for including a scene where Perry's character disintegrated a man (pictured), originally seen wearing a pendant appearing to display the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for \"[[Allah]]\", which was subsequently edited out of the video]]\nDuring the video's opening, it is revealed that the music video takes place \"a crazy long time ago\" in [[Memphis, Egypt]]. For the opening verses, Perry's character Katy P\u00e4tra, the witch of Memphis, is shown wearing a white dress and white and blue wig while floating on a large [[barge]] at sunset, with pyramids and palm trees visible in the background. The video transitions to a different scene where P\u00e4tra, now wearing a longer dress and a black wig, sits in an extravagant [[Sphinx]]-like throne while pharaohs gather to bring her expensive gifts (such as a large [[diamond]]) in an attempt to \"win her heart.\"\n\nAfter retrieving the first suitor's gift, she hits the man with a magical bolt of lightning from her hand, turning him into a pile of sand, and takes his jewels to wear on her teeth as a [[grill (jewelry)|grill]]. Another suitor brings her [[candy]], [[cupcake]]s, [[twinkie]]s, and spicy [[cheese puffs]]. After she burns her mouth with the spicy cheese puffs, she turns the suitor into a large cup of water, which she drinks. P\u00e4tra also appears as a gray statue in a scene where golden pythons and gray guardian statues such as [[Anubis]], [[Horus]], [[Nisroch]] and [[Apep]] surround her, and in a scene with a blue background where she wears a golden dress and several golden hieroglyphs levitate around her.\n\nDuring Juicy J's verse, the rapper emerges from a gold [[sarcophagus]] while P\u00e4tra accepts an Egyptian chariot with hydraulics (she turns the associated suitor into a set of giant dice to hang from the frame) and rejects a suitor who turns out to have the [[Sobek|face of a crocodile]] by turning him into a wallet. During the final chorus, the last suitor brings P\u00e4tra a large gold pyramid with a pink capstone, which she ascends. At the top of the pyramid, P\u00e4tra, dressed as [[Isis]], uses her powers to conjure up a magical \"perfect storm\" with pink, purple, and violet clouds. Although it seems like P\u00e4tra has finally found a gift she likes, the final frame of the video reveals that she has turned the final suitor into a [[Japanese urban legend#Jinmenken (\"Human-Faced Dog\")|dog with a human head]].\n\n===Reception===\nThe music video was criticized by some for appropriating the symbols and imagery of Egyptian culture. Cullen, the director, defended the music video, saying that, while he believes it is dangerous to rip things directly from present cultures without adding anything to them, Ancient Egypt is part of what he calls our \"shared collective mythology\". He said: \"The most important thing is that when you create something, and this is actually something Katy and I worked to do \u2014 you bring a new spin to it.\" Egyptologist [[David P. Silverman]] praised the music video's use of Egyptian imagery and the interest it could generate to viewers: \"[Egypt has] always been a part of popular culture. It encourages people to think of these things, and some of those people actually begin to learn a lot.\" The video was noted by conspiracy theorists for bearing resemblance to imagery used by the alleged [[Illuminati]], but Ritner rejected the allegations, saying that \"The many discussions of the Illuminati are nonsense\" and that, in fact, the [[Freemasonry|masonic]] imagery associated with the Illuminati is drawn from Egyptian imagery (as a common source for both).<ref name=\"TimeMagazine\" />\n\nOn June 9, 2015, the music video for \"Dark Horse\" became the first video by a female artist to reach 1 billion views on [[Vevo]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' Passes 1 Billion Vevo Views |first=Erin |last=Strecker |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6590902/katy-perry-dark-horse-1-billion-vevo-views |journal=Billboard |date=June 10, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612233806/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6590902/katy-perry-dark-horse-1-billion-vevo-views |archivedate=June 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Katy Perry Just Beat Taylor Swift To A Huge Milestone |first=Gil |last=Kaufman |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2181184/katy-perry-dark-horse-billion-video-taylor-swift/ |publisher=MTV News |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=June 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610090021/http://www.mtv.com/news/2181184/katy-perry-dark-horse-billion-video-taylor-swift/ |archivedate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> Perry also became the first female to have a video on [[YouTube]] with 1 billion views.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31487/katy-perry-just-left-taylor-swift-in-the-dust-on-youtube/ |title=Katy Perry Just Left Taylor Swift in the Dust on YouTube |magazine=[[Seventeen (American magazine)]] |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |date=June 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723153039/http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31487/katy-perry-just-left-taylor-swift-in-the-dust-on-youtube/ |archivedate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> As of March 2020, the video has received over 2.7 billion views on YouTube, making it the [[List of most viewed YouTube videos#All-time|18th most viewed video of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1000 Most Viewed YouTube Videos of All Time|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11E57E1166929B60 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809182529/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2r5g8xGajEwdXd3x1sZh8hC |archivedate=August 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Accusations of blasphemy====\nThe music video caused controversy among some [[Muslim]]s who criticized a scene in the video where a man wearing a [[pendant]] appearing to display the [[Arabic]] word for \"[[Allah]]\" is disintegrated and turned into sand by Perry's character.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

But the system that would assign to these degraded blacks an origin different from the whites, if it is not ready to be deserted by philosophers, must be relinquished as similar instances multiply; and that such must frequently happen cannot well be doubted, should no check impede the progress of humanity, which, meliorating the condition of slavery, necessarily leads to its final extinction.\u2014Let, however, the issue be what it will, I cannot but wish, on this occasion, to see the Public patronage keep pace with my black friend's merit.\"<br />(4) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112037299119;view=1up;seq=10 Banneker 1792a, p. 2.] \"Baltimore, August 20, 1791. BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh. In 1999 MdHS sent the journal to the Center for Conservation in Philadelphia where it was rebound, deacidified, and given full conservation treatment.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219030526/http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2014/02/06/the-dreams-of-benjamin-banneker/|archivedate=2018-02-19}}<br>(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302003904/http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|archivedate=March 2, 2020|url=http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|title=Banneker Astronomical Journal, 1781; 1790-1802; 1806.|work=[[Maryland Historical Society#Library|H.

Today it is an [[Italian surname]].\n\n==History==\nThe importance of Schiavoni's role in the [[Venetian Republic]] is best shown by the name of one of the main streets in Venice, Riva degli Schiavoni, just in front of the Doge Palace and San Marco Square.\n\nA number of artists who worked in Italy who were of [[Slavs|Slavic]] descent were nicknamed ''Schiavone'' by their origin: most famous among them are [[Giulio Clovio]], [[Francesco Laurana]], and [[Luciano Laurana]].\n\nSchiavone was also a designation of the [[Oltremarini]], a military unit of the same descent in the [[Venetian Navy]]. The basket-hilted sword [[schiavona]] was also named after the Schiavone.\n\n==Surname==\nIn [[Italy]], the surname Schiavone mostly occurs in the southernmost regions of the mainland, namely [[Campania]] and [[Apulia]], but it is also common in [[Rome]], [[Turin]], [[Milan]], and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref>[http://gens.labo.net/it/cognomi/genera.html?cognome=SCHIAVONE&t=cognomi-prov Cognomi.] ''GENS''.

Today it is an [[Italian surname]].\n\n==History==\nThe importance of Schiavoni's role in the [[Venetian Republic]] is best shown by the name of one of the main streets in Venice, Riva degli Schiavoni, just in front of the Doge Palace and San Marco Square.\n\nA number of artists who worked in Italy who were of [[Slavs|Slavic]] descent were nicknamed ''Schiavone'' by their origin: most famous among them are [[Giulio Clovio]], [[Francesco Laurana]], and [[Luciano Laurana]].\n\nSchiavone was also a designation of the [[Oltremarini]], a military unit of the same descent in the [[Venetian Navy]]. The basket-hilted sword [[schiavona]] was also named after the Schiavone.\n\n==Surname==\nIn [[Italy]], the surname Schiavone mostly occurs in the southernmost regions of the mainland, namely [[Campania]] and [[Apulia]], but it is also common in [[Rome]], [[Turin]], [[Milan]], and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref>[http://gens.labo.net/it/cognomi/genera.html?cognome=SCHIAVONE&t=cognomi-prov Cognomi.] ''GENS''.
