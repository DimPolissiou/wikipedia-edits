Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-batman-production-shut-down-due-to-coronavirus/|title=The Batman production shut down due to coronavirus|last=Musil|first=Steven|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good.

Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thinking about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.-->the eleventh film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) and<!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Director [[Matt Reeves]] stated: \"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character,<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> who was previously portrayed by [[J.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious.

Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros.

{"title_page": "Asbestos abatement", "text_new": "{{refimprove article|date=September 2018}}\n{{Globalize|date=September 2019}} \n[[File:FAC-roof-sheeting.JPG|right|thumb|Weathered fibrous asbestos sheeting showing loose fibres]]\n\nMany buildings contain [[asbestos]], which was used in spray-applied [[flame retardant]], thermal system insulation, and in a variety of other materials. Asbestos was sometimes \"[[Flocking (texture)|flocked]]\" above false ceilings, inside technical ducts, and in many other small spaces where firefighters would have difficulty gaining access. Structural components like asbestos panels were also used.  In residences, asbestos was often a component of a type of flocked acoustic ceiling called [[popcorn ceiling]] or \"cottage cheese ceiling\", until its production was banned in the US in 1978.  However, the ban allowed installers to use up remaining stocks, so houses built as late as 1986 could still have asbestos in their acoustic ceilings.{{cn|date=August 2014}}  The only way to be sure is to remove a sample and have it tested by a competent laboratory. \n\n==Rationale==\nDepending on how and where asbestos was applied, it might not pose any risk to most users of the building.  If the fibers cannot become dislodged, they cannot be inhaled, and thus the asbestos poses no risk. However, some methods of applying asbestos, particularly [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]], allow asbestos fibers to  gradually drop off into the air. Asbestos poses hazards to maintenance personnel who have to drill holes in walls for installation of cables or pipes. Even if the workers are [[ppe|protected]], such maintenance operation may release fibers into the air, which may be inhaled by others. Interventions in areas where asbestos is present often have to follow stringent procedures.\n\nWhen asbestos fibers can easily be made into airborne dust, the material is known as \"friable\". For example, a [[popcorn ceiling]] is extremely friable, whereas [[Vinyl composition tile|asbestos floor tile]] is considered non-friable.{{Citation needed|reason=evidence not provided by Vinyl tile link|date=January 2020}} Friable materials, such as popcorn ceiling tiles, have a lifespan between 20\u201340 years plus; whereas non-friable materials, such as asbestos roofing tiles, have a lifespan of 50\u2013100 years and beyond.   \n\nDifferent countries have different regulations and methods of enforcement, when it comes to asbestos removal. It is extremely important to remember that prior to any asbestos removal procedures taking place; the client has a duty of care and must verify that the specialist removal contractor can provide proof of the following:{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n*license if licensing is required within the jurisdiction\n*specific asbestos public and employer [[liability insurance]]\n*worker training to include supervisor and contract manager training within the past 12 months\n*worker fit-testing and medical surveillance within 12 months\n*specialist equipment testing within 6 months - DOP and PAT within the EU\n\nOptionally, the specialist contractor should be able to provide accreditation from [[ARCA]] or other such trade organization.{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Removal procedures==\n[[File:UK Asbestos Removal Enclosure.jpg|right|thumb|Typical UK temporary enclosure used for asbestos removal]]\n[[File:Asbestos-abatement-temporary-air-duct.jpg|right|thumb|A temporary plastic air duct used to exhaust filtered air from a negative air pressure (suction) machine|alt=A photo of a temporary plastic air duct that leads out from an area where asbestos abatement is taking place.]]\n[[File:Asbestos Removal 2008.JPG|thumb|right|An apartment complex that was subject to asbestos removal before [[demolition]]]]\nIn the United States, asbestos removal must be completed by an [[EPA]] licensed asbestos abatement contractor. Furthermore, the building has to be tested by an EPA licensed testing consultant. \n\nWhen asbestos abatement is taking place, occupants are not allowed to enter the area.  Typically, the part of the building from which asbestos is being removed has to be sealed off in order to prevent contamination of the other areas. Methods of sealing off an area often include the use of [[polyethylene]] film, [[duct tape]] and [[negative air pressure]] machines which are fitted with [[HEPA]] filters. The idea is that the contained area is pulling fresh air in as to not let asbestos fibers out into the surrounding environment.{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n\nOnly a special [[vacuum cleaner]] that is designed for asbestos containment (class H) can be safely used when cleaning up during and after asbestos removal.  Ordinary vacuum cleaners cannot be used, even those fitted with a HEPA filter.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/guidance/em4.pdf British government]</ref>  An ordinary vacuum cleaner will expel the asbestos fibres into the room air.\n\nIf the building is closed to normal users, it may be necessary to seal it off from outside atmosphere so that no accessible air is contaminated. Examples of buildings that required asbestos removal  include the [[Jussieu Campus]] and the [[Tour Montparnasse]].\n\nAn asbestos-containing building that is to be [[demolition|torn down]] may have to be sealed, and to have its asbestos safely removed before ordinary [[demolition]] can be performed.  The asbestos removal may take longer and cost more than the actual demolition. For example, the former seat of parliament of [[East Germany]], the [[Palast der Republik]], was stripped of most of its asbestos between 1998 and 2001, before it was finally demolished starting in 2006.\n\nNew innovative methods for asbestos removal have been used. One example is the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]\u2019s B238 building, where a track mounted wet cutting [[saw]] with a [[diamond blade]] was used in order to cut the building into small sections. These small sections were then double wrapped in plastic, the minimum requirement when transporting asbestos material, and driven to a [[landfill]]. This method not only contained the asbestos material within the [[gunite]] and metal layers of the walls, but also kept workers at a safe distance since the saw was [[Unmanned ground vehicle|controlled remotely]].<ref name=\"Open Air\">[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/19-FINAL_%20EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20002_Open%20Air%20Demolition%20of%20Asbestos%20Gunite.pdf Open Air Demolition of Asbestos Gunite by Using Track Mounted Wet Cutting Saw] dndkm.org</ref>\n\n==Alternatives to removal==\nRemoval is not the only means of Removal [http://www.aucoinsinsulation.com asbestos abatement]. Asbestos and asbestos-bearing materials may be \"enclosed\" or \"encapsulated\" to prevent building occupants from being exposed to the fibers.{{cn|date=April 2020<ref>www.aucoinsinsulation.com </ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n\n* [[Asbestine]]\n* [[Asbestos and the law]]\n* [[Fibro]]\n* [[Fireproofing]]\n* [[List of minerals]]\n* [[Mesothelioma]]\n* [[Vermiculite]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Asbestos|Abatement]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove article|date=September 2018}}\n{{Globalize|date=September 2019}} \n[[File:FAC-roof-sheeting.JPG|right|thumb|Weathered fibrous asbestos sheeting showing loose fibres]]\n\nMany buildings contain [[asbestos]], which was used in spray-applied [[flame retardant]], thermal system insulation, and in a variety of other materials.

For example, a [[popcorn ceiling]] is extremely friable, whereas [[Vinyl composition tile|asbestos floor tile]] is considered non-friable.{{Citation needed|reason=evidence not provided by Vinyl tile link|date=January 2020}} Friable materials, such as popcorn ceiling tiles, have a lifespan between 20\u201340 years plus; whereas non-friable materials, such as asbestos roofing tiles, have a lifespan of 50\u2013100 years and beyond.   \n\nDifferent countries have different regulations and methods of enforcement, when it comes to asbestos removal. It is extremely important to remember that prior to any asbestos removal procedures taking place; the client has a duty of care and must verify that the specialist removal contractor can provide proof of the following:{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n*license if licensing is required within the jurisdiction\n*specific asbestos public and employer [[liability insurance]]\n*worker training to include supervisor and contract manager training within the past 12 months\n*worker fit-testing and medical surveillance within 12 months\n*specialist equipment testing within 6 months - DOP and PAT within the EU\n\nOptionally, the specialist contractor should be able to provide accreditation from [[ARCA]] or other such trade organization.{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Removal procedures==\n[[File:UK Asbestos Removal Enclosure.jpg|right|thumb|Typical UK temporary enclosure used for asbestos removal]]\n[[File:Asbestos-abatement-temporary-air-duct.jpg|right|thumb|A temporary plastic air duct used to exhaust filtered air from a negative air pressure (suction) machine|alt=A photo of a temporary plastic air duct that leads out from an area where asbestos abatement is taking place.]]\n[[File:Asbestos Removal 2008.JPG|thumb|right|An apartment complex that was subject to asbestos removal before [[demolition]]]]\nIn the United States, asbestos removal must be completed by an [[EPA]] licensed asbestos abatement contractor. Furthermore, the building has to be tested by an EPA licensed testing consultant. \n\nWhen asbestos abatement is taking place, occupants are not allowed to enter the area.  Typically, the part of the building from which asbestos is being removed has to be sealed off in order to prevent contamination of the other areas. Methods of sealing off an area often include the use of [[polyethylene]] film, [[duct tape]] and [[negative air pressure]] machines which are fitted with [[HEPA]] filters. The idea is that the contained area is pulling fresh air in as to not let asbestos fibers out into the surrounding environment.{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n\nOnly a special [[vacuum cleaner]] that is designed for asbestos containment (class H) can be safely used when cleaning up during and after asbestos removal.  Ordinary vacuum cleaners cannot be used, even those fitted with a HEPA filter.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/guidance/em4.pdf British government]</ref>  An ordinary vacuum cleaner will expel the asbestos fibres into the room air.\n\nIf the building is closed to normal users, it may be necessary to seal it off from outside atmosphere so that no accessible air is contaminated. Examples of buildings that required asbestos removal  include the [[Jussieu Campus]] and the [[Tour Montparnasse]].\n\nAn asbestos-containing building that is to be [[demolition|torn down]] may have to be sealed, and to have its asbestos safely removed before ordinary [[demolition]] can be performed.  The asbestos removal may take longer and cost more than the actual demolition. For example, the former seat of parliament of [[East Germany]], the [[Palast der Republik]], was stripped of most of its asbestos between 1998 and 2001, before it was finally demolished starting in 2006.\n\nNew innovative methods for asbestos removal have been used. One example is the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]\u2019s B238 building, where a track mounted wet cutting [[saw]] with a [[diamond blade]] was used in order to cut the building into small sections. These small sections were then double wrapped in plastic, the minimum requirement when transporting asbestos material, and driven to a [[landfill]]. This method not only contained the asbestos material within the [[gunite]] and metal layers of the walls, but also kept workers at a safe distance since the saw was [[Unmanned ground vehicle|controlled remotely]].<ref name=\"Open Air\">[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/19-FINAL_%20EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20002_Open%20Air%20Demolition%20of%20Asbestos%20Gunite.pdf Open Air Demolition of Asbestos Gunite by Using Track Mounted Wet Cutting Saw] dndkm.org</ref>\n\n==Alternatives to removal==\nRemoval is not the only means of asbestos abatement. Asbestos and asbestos-bearing materials may be \"enclosed\" or \"encapsulated\" to prevent building occupants from being exposed to the fibers.{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n\n* [[Asbestine]]\n* [[Asbestos and the law]]\n* [[Fibro]]\n* [[Fireproofing]]\n* [[List of minerals]]\n* [[Mesothelioma]]\n* [[Vermiculite]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Asbestos|Abatement]]\n", "name_user": "216.181.255.67", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAlternatives to removal)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos_abatement"}

They had met while performing a play together. She had already appeared in her first film, an uncredited role as a student in the melodrama ''[[Girls in Distress|Young Girls in Trouble]]'' (''Jeunes filles en d\u00e9tresse'', 1939).<ref name=\"Grimes\"/> In June 1940, Lebeau and Dalio (who was Jewish) fled Paris ahead of the invading [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and reached [[Lisbon]]. They are presumed to have received transit visas from [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], allowing them to enter Spain and journey on to Portugal. It took them two months to obtain visas to Chile.<ref name=G&M-2016-05-16/>\n\nHowever, when their ship, the [[S.S. Quanza|S.S. ''Quanza'']], stopped in Mexico, they were stranded, along with around 200 other passengers, when the Chilean visas they had purchased turned out to be forgeries. Eventually, they were able to get temporary Canadian passports and entered the United States.<ref name=G&M-2016-05-16/> Lebeau made her Hollywood debut in ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]'' (1941), which featured [[Charles Boyer]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]] in the leading roles. The following year, she appeared in the [[Errol Flynn]] movie ''[[Gentleman Jim (1942 film)|Gentleman Jim]]'', a biography of Irish-American boxer [[James J. Corbett]].<ref name=holly/>\n\nLebeau learned English during a seven-week stay with Dalio on a Portuguese freighter that was seeking a port for landing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=Harrison|title=Behind the Scenes in Hollywood|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17084658/madeleine_lebeau/|work=The Call-Leader|date=March 29, 1941|location=Indiana, Elwood|page=2|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = February 2, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==''Casablanca''==\nLater that year she was cast in the role of Yvonne, [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character's discarded mistress, in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] signed her to a $100-a-week contract for twenty-six weeks to be in a number of films. On 22 June, while she was filming her scenes in ''Casablanca'', her husband, Marcel Dalio, who played Emil the croupier in the same film, filed for divorce in [[Los Angeles]] on the grounds of desertion. They divorced in 1942. Shortly before the release of the film, Warner Bros. terminated her contract. After  [[Joy Page]] died in April 2008, Lebeau was the last surviving credited cast member of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36295621 |title=Last surviving Casablanca actress Madeleine Lebeau dies |work=BBC News |accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nShe told [[Charlotte Chandler]], author of a biography of female lead [[Ingrid Bergman]], in the 1990s: \"It wasn't that I was cut out, it was because they kept changing the script, and each time they changed it, I had less of a part\". \"It was not personal, but I was so disappointed\".<ref name=\"Grimes\"/>\n\nLebeau's best moments in ''Casablanca'' are during the scene when French nationals sing \"The Marseillaise\" drowning out the group of German soldiers singing \"Die Wacht am Rhein\".

They had met while performing a play together. She had already appeared in her first film, an uncredited role as a student in the melodrama ''[[Girls in Distress|Young Girls in Trouble]]'' (''Jeunes filles en d\u00e9tresse'', 1939).<ref name=\"Grimes\"/> In June 1940, Lebeau and Dalio (who was Jewish) fled Paris ahead of the invading [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and reached [[Lisbon]]. They are presumed to have received transit visas from [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], allowing them to enter Spain and journey on to Portugal. It took them two months to obtain visas to Chile.<ref name=G&M-2016-05-16/>\n\nHowever, when their ship, the [[S.S. Quanza|S.S. ''Quanza'']], stopped in Mexico, they were stranded, along with around 200 other passengers, when the Chilean visas they had purchased turned out to be forgeries. Eventually, they were able to get temporary Canadian passports and entered the United States.<ref name=G&M-2016-05-16/> Lebeau made her Hollywood debut in ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]'' (1941), which featured [[Charles Boyer]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]] in the leading roles. The following year, she appeared in the [[Errol Flynn]] movie ''[[Gentleman Jim (1942 film)|Gentleman Jim]]'', a biography of Irish-American boxer [[James J.

[[Warner Bros.]] signed her to a $100-a-week contract for twenty-six weeks to be in a number of films. On 22 June, while she was filming her scenes in ''Casablanca'', her husband, Marcel Dalio, who played Emil the croupier in the same film, filed for divorce in [[Los Angeles]] on the grounds of desertion. They divorced in 1942. Shortly before the release of the film, Warner Bros. terminated her contract.

The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], remnant of the veil present in young fructifications, is whitish, descendent, thin and fragile. The odor and taste resembles almonds.\n\nThe [[spore print]] is dark brownish. The [[spores]] are 4.5\u20136.0 x 3.5\u20134.0&nbsp;\u03bcm on average, [[nonamyloid]], and elliptical. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] turns slightly in yellow when cut or bruised, sometime with orange tints in [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]].\n\nMacrochemical reactions: flesh turns orange and [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] turns yellow in contact with 10% [[KOH test|KOH]].\n\n==Other taxonomic considerations==\n\nSeveral characteristics like flesh yellowing on contact or in air, orange reaction with KOH, overall size, puts this species within ''Minores'' [[section (biology)|section]] of the genus ''[[Agaricus]]'', along with ''[[Agaricus comtulus]]'', ''[[Agaricus xantholepis]]'', ''[[Agaricus porphyrizon]]'' and ''[[Agaricus luteomaculatus]]''.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n'''''Agaricus dulcidulus''''' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species in close relation with different [[oak]] species.<ref>LENTI, Istv\u00e1n.

The basidiocarps appear, depending on microclimatic conditions, in late July to early October.\n\n==Edibility==\nAlthough considered to be [[edible mushroom|edible]], the small size and usually the sporadic presence prevents it from being widely eaten.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Agaricus species|List of ''Agaricus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4691341}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agaricus Dulcidulus}}\n[[Category:Agaricus|dulcidulus]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1874]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Africa]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricus_dulcidulus"}
