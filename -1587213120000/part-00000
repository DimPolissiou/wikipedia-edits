Harrison went on to become one of the most productive receivers from that draft class, which included [[Keyshawn Johnson]], [[Eric Moulds]], [[Bobby Engram]], [[Muhsin Muhammad]], [[Eddie Kennison]], [[Terry Glenn]], [[Amani Toomer]], [[Joe Horn]], and [[Terrell Owens]] among others.\n\nIn 2002, Harrison broke [[Herman Moore]]'s single season receptions record by 20 receptions.

He is also one of only seven wide receivers in NFL history to reach 100 touchdowns.\n\nIn 2005, Harrison had five 100+ yard receiving games in a seven-game stretch late in the season. During Week 15, he passed [[Isaac Bruce]] to become 10th in all-time career receiving yards, and also the leader among active players. He maintained this title for exactly two seasons, until Bruce retook the lead in Week 15 of 2007. Harrison had injured his knee against the Denver Broncos while attempting a block and was lost for the season, making only a small appearance in their lone playoff game that season. It marked only the second time Harrison had missed regular season action due to injuries and the first since 1998.\n\nOn December 14, 2008, in a game against the [[Detroit Lions]], Harrison caught his 1,095th career reception, passing [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] for third all time.

On January 6, 2009, Philadelphia District Attorney [[Lynne Abraham]] confirmed that the gun that fired shots at Dixon was the same model as Harrison's gun, but they had been unable to determine who pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AgtnMKpTyiRcunZwv_Iez7tDubYF?slug=ap-colts-harrison&prov=ap&type=lgns |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 14, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019074505/http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news |archivedate=October 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Philadelphia District Attorney also stated that she was not going to pursue charges in this case due to conflicting witness statements.

At the hospital after the shooting, detectives questioned Dixon before surgery and he stated that it stemmed from the Harrison incident a year prior and that Harrison had hired a gun man to shoot him. An informant also made a statement asserting the gunman that killed Dixon was Lonnie Harrison, Marvin Harrison's cousin. On June 16, 2010, [[Shaun Assael]] of ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' reported that police confiscated a 9mm handgun from Harrison during a routine traffic stop on Wednesday in Philadelphia. Police tested the gun to see if it matches three spent 9mm shell casings that ended up inside the truck driven by Dwight Dixon at the scene of an April 2008 shooting. Dixon, who eventually was shot and killed after filing a civil lawsuit, claimed that the casings came from a second gun that Harrison fired. Authorities already have matched other bullets to a separate gun that Harrison owns\u2014and that he stated was in his home on the day the shooting occurred. Police found the gun during a search of Harrison's Escalade. The stop occurred as Harrison drove the vehicle the wrong way on a one-way street. Harrison claimed he did not have a gun. But police believed they saw Harrison put what appeared to be a weapon in the console between the two front seats. They concluded that they had probable cause to search the vehicle, and they found the gun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4826851 |title=Sources: FBI joins probe of Marvin Harrison gun case |publisher=ESPN|date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> Harrison was not charged.\n\nAnother incident occurred in 2014, when Harrison narrowly escaped a [[Philadelphia]] shooting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marvin Harrison Narrowly Avoids Gunfire in Philadelphia|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/263154971.html|work=philly.com|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's son, Marvin Jr., announced his commitment to play for the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] football team as wide receiver on October 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ohio State gets commitment from Marvin Harrison Jr|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/27974208/ohio-state-gets-commitment-receiver-marvin-harrison-jr|work=espn.com|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080518011636/http://www.colts.com/sub.cfm?page=bio&player_id=2 Indianapolis Colts bio]\n{{Footballstats |nfl=HAR608874 |cfl= |afl= |espn=939 |cbs= |yahoo=3514 |fox= |si= |pfr=H/HarrMa00 |rotoworld=}}\n\n{{navboxes\n| title = Marvin Harrison\u2014awards, championships, and honors\n| list1 =\n{{1996 NFL Draft}}\n{{ColtsFirstPick}}\n{{Super Bowl XLI}}\n{{NFL receiving yardage leaders}}\n{{NFL receiving touchdown leaders}}\n{{NFL2000s}}\n{{NFL100}}\n{{Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor}}\n{{2016 Football HOF}}\n{{Pro Football Hall of Fame members}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harrison, Marvin}}\n[[Category:1972 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:African-American players of American football]]\n[[Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players]]\n[[Category:American football wide receivers]]\n[[Category:Syracuse Orange football players]]\n[[Category:Indianapolis Colts players]]\n[[Category:People from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Super Bowl champions]]\n[[Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American football wide receiver}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use American English|date=December 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox NFL biography\n| name = Marvin Harrison\n| image = Marvin Harrison in 2007 Training Camp 2.jpg\n| image_size =\n| alt =\n| caption = Harrison with the Indianapolis Colts in 2007\n| number = 88\n| position = [[Wide receiver]]\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1972|8|25|mf=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n| death_date =\n| death_place =\n| height_ft = 6\n| height_in = 0\n| weight_lbs = 185\n| high_school = [[Roman Catholic High School|Philadelphia (PA) Roman Catholic]]\n| college = [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]]\n| draftyear = 1996\n| draftround = 1\n| draftpick = 19\n| pastteams =\n* [[Indianapolis Colts]] ({{NFL Year|1996}}\u2013{{NFL Year|2008}}) \n| highlights =\n* [[Super Bowl]] champion ([[Super Bowl XLI|XLI]])\n* 8\u00d7 [[Pro Bowl]] ([[2000 Pro Bowl|1999]]\u2013[[2007 Pro Bowl|2006]])\n* 3\u00d7 First-team [[All-Pro]] ([[1999 All-Pro Team|1999]], [[2002 All-Pro Team|2002]], [[2006 All-Pro Team|2006]])\n* 5\u00d7 Second-team [[All-Pro]] ([[2000 All-Pro Team|2000]], [[2001 All-Pro Team|2001]], [[2003 All-Pro Team|2003]]\u2013[[2005 All-Pro Team|2005]])\n* 2\u00d7 [[List of National Football League season receiving yards leaders|NFL receiving yards leader]] (1999, 2002)\n* [[List of National Football League season receiving touchdown leaders|NFL receiving touchdowns co-leader]] (2005)\n* 2\u00d7 [[List of National Football League annual receptions leaders|NFL receptions leader]] (2000, 2002)\n* [[National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team|NFL 2000s All-Decade Team]]\n* [[NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team]]\n* [[Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor]]\n* All-[[Big East]] (1995)\n| statlabel1 = Receptions\n| statvalue1 = 1,102\n| statlabel2 = Receiving yards\n| statvalue2 = 14,580\n| statlabel3 = Receiving [[touchdowns]]\n| statvalue3 = 128\n| nfl = HAR608874\n| HOF = marvin-harrison\n}}\n'''Marvin Darnell Harrison''' (born August 25, 1972) is a former [[American football]] [[wide receiver]] who played 13 seasons in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).

Harrison went on to become one of the most productive receivers from that draft class, which included [[Keyshawn Johnson]], [[Eric Moulds]], [[Bobby Engram]], [[Muhsin Muhammad]], [[Eddie Kennison]], [[Terry Glenn]], [[Amani Toomer]], [[Joe Horn]], and [[Terrell Owens]] among others.\n\nIn 2002, Harrison broke [[Herman Moore]]'s single season receptions record by 20 receptions. He finished with 143 catches, and he also had 1,722 yards receiving. That record stood until December 22nd 2019, when [[Michael Thomas (wide receiver, born 1993)|Michael Thomas]] of the New Orleans Saints broke that record with 144.  In December 2006, Harrison became just the fourth player in NFL history to record 1000 receptions, joining [[Jerry Rice]] (1549), [[Cris Carter]] (1101), and [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] (1094). He is also one of only seven wide receivers in NFL history to reach 100 touchdowns.\n\nIn 2005, Harrison had five 100+ yard receiving games in a seven-game stretch late in the season. During Week 15, he passed [[Isaac Bruce]] to become 10th in all-time career receiving yards, and also the leader among active players. He maintained this title for exactly two seasons, until Bruce retook the lead in Week 15 of 2007. Harrison had injured his knee against the Denver Broncos while attempting a block and was lost for the season, making only a small appearance in their lone playoff game that season. It marked only the second time Harrison had missed regular season action due to injuries and the first since 1998.\n\nOn December 14, 2008, in a game against the [[Detroit Lions]], Harrison caught his 1,095th career reception, passing [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] for third all time.

On January 6, 2009, Philadelphia District Attorney [[Lynne Abraham]] confirmed that the gun that fired shots at Dixon was the same model as Harrison's gun, but they had been unable to determine who pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AgtnMKpTyiRcunZwv_Iez7tDubYF?slug=ap-colts-harrison&prov=ap&type=lgns |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 14, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019074505/http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news |archivedate=October 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Philadelphia District Attorney also stated that she was not going to pursue charges in this case due to conflicting witness statements.

At the hospital after the shooting, detectives questioned Dixon before surgery and he stated that it stemmed from the Harrison incident a year prior and that Harrison had hired a gun man to shoot him. An informant also made a statement asserting the gunman that killed Dixon was Lonnie Harrison, Marvin Harrison's cousin. On June 16, 2010, [[Shaun Assael]] of ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' reported that police confiscated a 9mm handgun from Harrison during a routine traffic stop on Wednesday in Philadelphia. Police tested the gun to see if it matches three spent 9mm shell casings that ended up inside the truck driven by Dwight Dixon at the scene of an April 2008 shooting. Dixon, who eventually was shot and killed after filing a civil lawsuit, claimed that the casings came from a second gun that Harrison fired. Authorities already have matched other bullets to a separate gun that Harrison owns\u2014and that he stated was in his home on the day the shooting occurred. Police found the gun during a search of Harrison's Escalade. The stop occurred as Harrison drove the vehicle the wrong way on a one-way street. Harrison claimed he did not have a gun. But police believed they saw Harrison put what appeared to be a weapon in the console between the two front seats. They concluded that they had probable cause to search the vehicle, and they found the gun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4826851 |title=Sources: FBI joins probe of Marvin Harrison gun case |publisher=ESPN|date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> Harrison was not charged.\n\nAnother incident occurred in 2014, when Harrison narrowly escaped a [[Philadelphia]] shooting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marvin Harrison Narrowly Avoids Gunfire in Philadelphia|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/263154971.html|work=philly.com|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's son, Marvin Jr., announced his commitment to play for the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] football team as wide receiver on October 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ohio State gets commitment from Marvin Harrison Jr|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/27974208/ohio-state-gets-commitment-receiver-marvin-harrison-jr|work=espn.com|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080518011636/http://www.colts.com/sub.cfm?page=bio&player_id=2 Indianapolis Colts bio]\n{{Footballstats |nfl=HAR608874 |cfl= |afl= |espn=939 |cbs= |yahoo=3514 |fox= |si= |pfr=H/HarrMa00 |rotoworld=}}\n\n{{navboxes\n| title = Marvin Harrison\u2014awards, championships, and honors\n| list1 =\n{{1996 NFL Draft}}\n{{ColtsFirstPick}}\n{{Super Bowl XLI}}\n{{NFL receiving yardage leaders}}\n{{NFL receiving touchdown leaders}}\n{{NFL2000s}}\n{{NFL100}}\n{{Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor}}\n{{2016 Football HOF}}\n{{Pro Football Hall of Fame members}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harrison, Marvin}}\n[[Category:1972 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:African-American players of American football]]\n[[Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players]]\n[[Category:American football wide receivers]]\n[[Category:Syracuse Orange football players]]\n[[Category:Indianapolis Colts players]]\n[[Category:People from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Super Bowl champions]]\n[[Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees]]\n", "name_user": "Bagumba", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison"}
{"title_page": "IB Diploma Programme", "text_new": "{{short description|Educational programme}}\n{{other uses|Baccalaureate (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\n{{IB}}\nThe '''International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme''' ('''IBDP''') is a two-year [[Curriculum|educational programme]] primarily aimed at 16-to-19-year-olds. The programme provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It was developed in the early to mid-1960s in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]], by a group of international educators. After a six-year pilot programme that ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established. \n\nAdministered by the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries, in one of three languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, students must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each [[#Subject groups|subject group]], and [[#Core requirements and subject groups|three core requirements]]. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. \n\nGenerally, the IBDP has been well received. It has been commended for introducing interdisciplinary thinking to students. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper claims that the IBDP is \"more academically challenging and broader than three or four [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]\".<ref name=\"guardian-2009-02-10\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/10/international-baccalaureate-moved-amsterdam|title=Leap from Cardiff to Amsterdam for Baccalaureate|work=Guardian.co.uk|first=Jessica|last=Shepard|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=28 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==History and background==\nIn 1945 the \"Conference of Internationally-minded Schools\" asked the [[International School of Geneva]] (Ecolint) to create an international schools programme.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\">Peterson p. 17</ref><ref>Fox p. 5</ref> When he became director of Ecolint's English division, Desmond Cole-Baker began to develop the idea, and in 1962, his colleague Robert Leach organised a conference in Geneva, at which the term \"International Baccalaureate\" was first mentioned.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\"/><ref>HIll, 2007 p. 19</ref> An American social studies teacher, Leach organized the conference\u2014with a $2500 grant from [[UNESCO]]\u2014which was attended by observers from European schools and [[UNESCO]]. Writing about the genesis of the International Baccalaureate in ''Schools Across Frontiers'', [[Alec Peterson]] credits Leach as \"the original promoter of the International Baccalaureate.\"<ref>Peterson p. 18</ref>  At the end of the conference, Unesco funded the International School Association with an additional $10,000, which was inadequate to do more than produce a few papers, or bring teachers together for meetings.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\">Peterson p. 18-26</ref>\n[[File:Ecolintchateau.jpg|thumb|right|Ch\u00e2teau at [[Ecolint]] where [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] was developed.]]\n\nBy 1964, international educators such as [[Alec Peterson]] (director of the Department of Education at [[Oxford University]]), [[Harlan Hanson]] (director of the [[AP Program|College Board Advanced Placement Program]]), Desmond Cole (director of [[United Nations International School]] in New York) and Desmond Cole-Baker (head of the International School of Geneva) founded the International Schools Examination Syndicate (ISES).<ref name=\"Fox65-75\">Fox, pp. 65-75</ref><ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\">Mathews, p. 22</ref> Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States, and Hanson, in particular, brought his experience from a long relationship with the [[College Board]].<ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\"/> According to Peterson, \"the breakthrough in the history of the IB\" came in 1965 with a grant from the [[The Century Foundation|Twentieth Century Fund]], which commissioned [[Martin Mayer (writer)|Martin Mayer]], author of ''The Schools'', to produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for [[international school]]s that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> This led to conferences involving Ecolint, [[Atlantic College|United World College of the Atlantic (UWC Atlantic College)]], and others in the spring and fall of 1965, at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/>\n\nThe Ford Foundation grant, secured in 1966, funded Peterson's study at Oxford University, which focused on three issues: a comparative analysis of \"secondary educational programmes in European countries...in cooperation with the Council of Europe\"; university expectations for secondary students intending to enter university; and a \"statistical comparison of IB pilot examination results with...national school leaving examinations such as [[GCE Advanced Level|British A Levels]] and [[AP Program|US College Board (AP) Tests]]\".<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/><ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> As a result of the study and the curriculum model developed at [[Atlantic College|UWC Atlantic College]], Peterson initiated the pattern of combining \"general education with specialization\", which melded with the curricula of the United States and Canada, and became the \"curriculum framework\"  proposed at the UNESCO conference in Geneva in 1967.<ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> Late in 1967, ISES was restructured and renamed the IB Council of Foundation, and John Goormaghtigh became the first president in January 1968.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> In 1967, the group, which by then also included [[Ralph W.

The programme provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It was developed in the early to mid-1960s in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]], by a group of international educators. After a six-year pilot programme that ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established. \n\nAdministered by the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries, in one of three languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, students must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each [[#Subject groups|subject group]], and [[#Core requirements and subject groups|three core requirements]]. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator. \n\nGenerally, the IBDP has been well received.
