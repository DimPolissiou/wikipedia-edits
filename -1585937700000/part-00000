He is a producer and DJ commonly associated with the North London grime scene, including [[Roll Deep]] and [[Boy Better Know]]. Skepta released his debut album ''[[Greatest Hits (Skepta album)|Greatest Hits]]'' on 17 September 2007. It was released on the Boy Better Know label. Skepta self-released the first single \"[[Rolex Sweep]]\" in September 2008, which reached number 89 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He released the album ''[[Microphone Champion]]'' on 1 June 2009. The single \"Too Many Man\", with JME, Wiley, Frisco and Shorty, charted at number 79.\n\nSkepta has released five singles off his third studio album ''[[Doin' It Again]]'' (first with a major label): \"[[Bad Boy (Skepta song)|Bad Boy]]\", \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\", \"[[Cross My Heart (Skepta song)|Cross My Heart]]\" featuring [[Preeya Kalidas]], \"[[So Alive (Skepta song)|So Alive]]\" and \"[[Amnesia (Skepta song)|Amnesia]]\", as well as a video for \"[[Hello Good Morning#Remixes|Hello Good Morning]]\" (Grime Remix). Three singles reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\" being the most successful at number 14. \"Cross My Heart\" came in at number 31 and dropped out of the Top 40 a week later. ''Doin' it Again'' spent three weeks in the top 100 album charts and debuted and peaked at number 19 on its first week of release. In 2012, Skepta released two singles from his forthcoming fourth album.\n\nSkepta's second major label album, ''The Honeymoon'', was intended to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, but was delayed till 2012. After a disappointing response from the first two singles Skepta decided to release a purchasable mixtape, titled ''Blacklisted''. This was released on 2 December 2012 along with music videos to support the release. In March 2014, Skepta provided a verse for the remix of \"[[German Whip]]\" by [[Meridian Dan]]. In the same month, he debuted his new single, \"[[That's Not Me (Skepta song)|That's Not Me]]\", featuring his brother, [[JME (rapper)|JME]]. Released on 8 June 2014, the song peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br/><ref name=\"UK\">Peak positions in the UK:\n* For all except noted: {{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5188/skepta/|title=Skepta|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=19 May 2018}}\n* For \"Too Many Man\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: DJ S - The System Of Life|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Lush\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/091031cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 31.10.2009 (wk43)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For ''Microphone Champion'': {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/090613cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 13.06.2009 (wk23)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Amnesia\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/110212cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 12.02.2011 (wk5)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"It Ain't Safe\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/160514cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 14.05.2016 (wk19)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br/><ref name=\"AUS\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Skepta|title=Discography Skepta|publisher=Australian Charts Portal.

He is a producer and DJ commonly associated with the North London grime scene, including [[Roll Deep]] and [[Boy Better Know]]. Skepta released his debut album ''[[Greatest Hits (Skepta album)|Greatest Hits]]'' on 17 September 2007. It was released on the Boy Better Know label. Skepta self-released the first single \"[[Rolex Sweep]]\" in September 2008, which reached number 89 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He released the album ''[[Microphone Champion]]'' on 1 June 2009. The single \"Too Many Man\", with JME, Wiley, Frisco and Shorty, charted at number 79.\n\nSkepta has released five singles off his third studio album ''[[Doin' It Again]]'' (first with a major label): \"[[Bad Boy (Skepta song)|Bad Boy]]\", \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\", \"[[Cross My Heart (Skepta song)|Cross My Heart]]\" featuring [[Preeya Kalidas]], \"[[So Alive (Skepta song)|So Alive]]\" and \"[[Amnesia (Skepta song)|Amnesia]]\", as well as a video for \"[[Hello Good Morning#Remixes|Hello Good Morning]]\" (Grime Remix). Three singles reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\" being the most successful at number 14. \"Cross My Heart\" came in at number 31 and dropped out of the Top 40 a week later. ''Doin' it Again'' spent three weeks in the top 100 album charts and debuted and peaked at number 19 on its first week of release. In 2012, Skepta released two singles from his forthcoming fourth album.\n\nSkepta's second major label album, ''The Honeymoon'', was intended to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, but was delayed till 2012. After a disappointing response from the first two singles Skepta decided to release a purchasable mixtape, titled ''Blacklisted''. This was released on 2 December 2012 along with music videos to support the release. In March 2014, Skepta provided a verse for the remix of \"[[German Whip]]\" by [[Meridian Dan]]. In the same month, he debuted his new single, \"[[That's Not Me (Skepta song)|That's Not Me]]\", featuring his brother, [[JME (rapper)|JME]]. Released on 8 June 2014, the song peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br/><ref name=\"UK\">Peak positions in the UK:\n* For all except noted: {{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5188/skepta/|title=Skepta|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=19 May 2018}}\n* For \"Too Many Man\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: DJ S - The System Of Life|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Lush\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/091031cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 31.10.2009 (wk43)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For ''Microphone Champion'': {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/090613cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 13.06.2009 (wk23)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Amnesia\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/110212cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 12.02.2011 (wk5)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"It Ain't Safe\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/160514cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 14.05.2016 (wk19)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br/><ref name=\"AUS\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Skepta|title=Discography Skepta|publisher=Australian Charts Portal.

He noted that while the [[2007 Lebanon conflict]] saw a mere 450 gunmen in one refugee camp kill or wound several hundred Lebanese security forces and force the government to reduce the camp to rubble to flush them out, the Syrian war spillover was dealt with much more cleanly and efficiently, with the Lebanese Army swiftly defeating and evicting a force of several thousand Islamic State militants. In addition to noting the large improvements in troop and equipment quality over the preceding decade (partly thanks to American funding), Saab also noted that the battles solidified the legitimacy of the Lebanese Army as a defender of the country, earning it positive publicity among the country's northern regions and detracting from the influence of Hezbollah.<ref>Saab, Bilal.

He noted that while the [[2007 Lebanon conflict]] saw a mere 450 gunmen in one refugee camp kill or wound several hundred Lebanese security forces and force the government to reduce the camp to rubble to flush them out, the Syrian war spillover was dealt with much more cleanly and efficiently, with the Lebanese Army swiftly defeating and evicting a force of several thousand Islamic State militants. In addition to noting the large improvements in troop and equipment quality over the preceding decade (partly thanks to American funding), Saab also noted that the battles solidified the legitimacy of the Lebanese Army as a defender of the country, earning it positive publicity among the country's northern regions and detracting from the influence of Hezbollah.<ref>Saab, Bilal.

{"title_page": "Western Marxism", "text_new": "{{Marxism|variants}}\n'''Western Marxism''' is a current of [[Marxist theory]] arising from [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] in the aftermath of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]] and the ascent of [[Leninism]]. The term denotes a loose collection of theorists who advanced an interpretation of [[Marxism]] distinct from [[Soviet Marxism|that codified by the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Jacoby|1991|p=581}}\n\nThe Western Marxists placed more emphasis on Marxism's [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[sociology|sociological]] aspects, and the origins of [[Karl Marx]]'s thought in the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (for which reason it is sometimes called ''Hegelian Marxism''),{{sfn|Jay|1984|p=3}} as well as what they called the \"[[Young Marx]]\" (the more humanistic early works of Marx). Although some early figures such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] had been prominent in political activities, Western Marxism became primarily the reserve of academia, especially after the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Anderson|1976|pp=49-50}} Prominent figures included [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]].\n\nSince the 1960s, the concept has been closely associated with the [[New Left]]. Many of the Western Marxists were adherents of [[Marxist humanism]] but the term also encompasses their critics in the form of the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Louis Althusser]].{{sfn|Jay|1984|p=3}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe phrase ''Western Marxism'' was first used disparagingly by the [[Third International]] in 1923.  [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] re-appropriated and popularized the term with his book ''Adventures of the Dialectic'' in 1953.{{sfnm |1a1=Jay |1y=1984 |1p=1 |2a1=Merleau-Ponty |2y=1973 |2pp=30\u201359}} While it is often contrasted with the [[Soviet Marxism|Marxism of the Soviet Union]], Western Marxists have been divided in their opinion of it and other [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]s.{{sfn|Jay|1984|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n==History and distinctive elements==\nAlthough there have been many schools of [[Marxist]] thought that are sharply distinguished from [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], such as [[Austromarxism]] or the [[left communism]] of [[Antonie Pannekoek]], the theorists who downplay the primacy of economic analysis are considered Western Marxists, as they focus on areas such as [[culture]], [[philosophy]], and [[art]].{{sfn|Jacoby|1991|p=581}}\n\nGy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs's ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' and [[Karl Korsch]]'s ''Marxism and Philosophy'', published in 1923, are the works that inaugurated Western Marxism.{{sfn|Jacoby|1991|p=581}} In these books, Luk\u00e1cs and Korsch proffer a Marxism that emphasizes the [[Hegelian]] components of [[Karl Marx]]'s thought. Marxism is not simply a theory of [[political economy]] that improves on its [[bourgeois]] predecessors. Nor is it a scientific [[sociology]], akin to the [[Natural science|natural sciences]]. Marxism is primarily a critique&nbsp;\u2013 a self-conscious transformation of society.

The term denotes a loose collection of theorists who advanced an interpretation of [[Marxism]] distinct from [[Soviet Marxism|that codified by the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Jacoby|1991|p=581}}\n\nThe Western Marxists placed more emphasis on Marxism's [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[sociology|sociological]] aspects, and the origins of [[Karl Marx]]'s thought in the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (for which reason it is sometimes called ''Hegelian Marxism''),{{sfn|Jay|1984|p=3}} as well as what they called the \"[[Young Marx]]\" (the more humanistic early works of Marx). Although some early figures such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] had been prominent in political activities, Western Marxism became primarily the reserve of academia, especially after the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Anderson|1976|pp=49-50}} Prominent figures included [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]].\n\nSince the 1960s, the concept has been closely associated with the [[New Left]]. Many of the Western Marxists were adherents of [[Marxist humanism]] but the term also encompasses their critics in the form of the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Louis Althusser]].{{sfn|Jay|1984|p=3}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe phrase ''Western Marxism'' was first used disparagingly by the [[Third International]] in 1923.

It is the third installment in the [[Friday (film series)|''Friday'' series]]. The film was theatrically released on November 22, 2002, to minor box office success but generally negative reviews. This film has since gained a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins when a robber ([[Rickey Smiley]]), disguised as [[Santa Claus]], breaks into Craig ([[Ice Cube]]) and Day-Day's ([[Mike Epps]]) house at 3:37 AM on Christmas Eve. Craig fights with the robber, trashing their apartment while making frantic, futile attempts to wake Day-Day. The robber escapes with Craig and Day-Day's Christmas presents and rent money. The same morning, the police come over to get a report.\n\nAfter the police leave, Mrs. Pearly (Bebe Drake) comes in and says that if the two do not pay their rent money by the end of the day, she will evict them. Furthermore, she promises to send her [[homosexual]] [[ex-convict]] son, Damon ([[Terry Crews]]), who just got out of prison after 12 years, after them if they do not pay in a timely manner. The same day, Craig and Day-Day get jobs as \"Top Flight Security Guards\" from Moly ([[Maz Jobrani]]), the property manager and owner of a notoriously squalid doughnut shop and the shopping center that they are assigned to patrol.\n\nLater that day, they meet Donna ([[K.D. Aubert]]) and Money Mike ([[Katt Williams]]), who run a fledgling shop called 'Pimps and Hoes.' The shopping center is also the home of a BBQ rib restaurant called 'Bros. BBQ', owned by the cousins' fathers, Willie ([[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]) and Elroy ([[Don \"D.C.\" Curry]]).\n\nA couple of baseheads try to rob Money Mike's store, but Craig and Day-Day catch them both. Mike offers them a cash reward, but Craig refuses it and instead invites him to his Christmas party. Willie and Elroy are having trouble with some of the children. When one of them kicks Elroy, he retaliates by taking out a belt and starts a series of beatings on the kids. Then, shortly after Moly gives Craig and Day-Day a lunch break, a gang of thugs, supposedly the grandsons of some of the carolers that were chased off by Day-Day for loitering in front of the corner store, chase after Craig and Day-Day. After failing to catch them, they proceed to beat up Moly for supposedly hiding them, resulting in the two throwing away their uniforms after witnessing what happened to Moly, and ultimately getting unjustly fired from their jobs (due to Moly accusing them of lazing around and allowing him to be beaten, even though he'd just given them a lunch break). As revenge, Willie rats Moly out to the Department of Health.\n\nLater that night, Craig and Day-Day throw a [[rent party]] to recoup their stolen rent money and stay in their apartment. While Money Mike is in the bathroom, Damon tries to [[rape]] him, but fails when Money Mike crunches his testicles with pliers. Damon then proceeds to chase him when he tries to run away. Also Mrs. Pearly comes on to Willie when he uses her bathroom, causing Craig's mother, Betty ([[Anna Maria Horsford]]), to come in and attack her when she catches the two. Craig and Day-Day see the robber and give chase, running into other obstacles (including an elderly comedic but crazed gunman, played by Epps) and are ultimately successful after the robber gets run over by Pinky's limousine.\n\nThe movie ends with Craig and Day-Day retrieving their stolen rent money and Christmas presents and tying the robber up on his roof. During the credits, it is revealed that Craig and Donna hooked up after Craig returned, Damon is still chasing Money Mike throughout the neighborhood, and that Ms. Pearly tried to stop the party by calling the police, but they left after receiving marijuana as a bribe.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ice Cube]] &mdash; Craig Jones / Narrator\n*[[Mike Epps]] &mdash; Day-Day Jones / Old Man with Shotgun\n*[[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] &mdash; Mr. Willie Jones\n*[[Don 'D.C.'

It is the third installment in the [[Friday (film series)|''Friday'' series]]. The film was theatrically released on November 22, 2002, to minor box office success but generally negative reviews. This film has since gained a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins when a robber ([[Rickey Smiley]]), disguised as [[Santa Claus]], breaks into Craig ([[Ice Cube]]) and Day-Day's ([[Mike Epps]]) house at 3:37 AM on Christmas Eve. Craig fights with the robber, trashing their apartment while making frantic, futile attempts to wake Day-Day. The robber escapes with Craig and Day-Day's Christmas presents and rent money. The same morning, the police come over to get a report.\n\nAfter the police leave, Mrs. Pearly (Bebe Drake) comes in and says that if the two do not pay their rent money by the end of the day, she will evict them. Furthermore, she promises to send her [[homosexual]] [[ex-convict]] son, Damon ([[Terry Crews]]), who just got out of prison after 12 years, after them if they do not pay in a timely manner. The same day, Craig and Day-Day get jobs as \"Top Flight Security Guards\" from Moly ([[Maz Jobrani]]), the property manager and owner of a notoriously squalid doughnut shop and the shopping center that they are assigned to patrol.\n\nLater that day, they meet Donna ([[K.D. Aubert]]) and Money Mike ([[Katt Williams]]), who run a fledgling shop called 'Pimps and Hoes.' The shopping center is also the home of a BBQ rib restaurant called 'Bros. BBQ', owned by the cousins' fathers, Willie ([[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]) and Elroy ([[Don \"D.C.\" Curry]]).\n\nA couple of baseheads try to rob Money Mike's store, but Craig and Day-Day catch them both. Mike offers them a cash reward, but Craig refuses it and instead invites him to his Christmas party. Willie and Elroy are having trouble with some of the children. When one of them kicks Elroy, he retaliates by taking out a belt and starts a series of beatings on the kids. Then, shortly after Moly gives Craig and Day-Day a lunch break, a gang of thugs, supposedly the grandsons of some of the carolers that were chased off by Day-Day for loitering in front of the corner store, chase after Craig and Day-Day. After failing to catch them, they proceed to beat up Moly for supposedly hiding them, resulting in the two throwing away their uniforms after witnessing what happened to Moly, and ultimately getting unjustly fired from their jobs (due to Moly accusing them of lazing around and allowing him to be beaten, even though he'd just given them a lunch break). As revenge, Willie rats Moly out to the Department of Health.\n\nLater that night, Craig and Day-Day throw a [[rent party]] to recoup their stolen rent money and stay in their apartment. While Money Mike is in the bathroom, Damon tries to [[rape]] him, but fails when Money Mike crunches his testicles with pliers. Damon then proceeds to chase him when he tries to run away. Also Mrs. Pearly comes on to Willie when he uses her bathroom, causing Craig\u2019s mother, Betty ([[Anna Maria Horsford]]), to come in and attack her when she catches the two. Craig and Day-Day see the robber and give chase, running into other obstacles (including an elderly comedic but crazed gunman, played by Epps) and are ultimately successful after the robber gets run over by Pinky's limousine.\n\nThe movie ends with Craig and Day-Day retrieving their stolen rent money and Christmas presents and tying the robber up on his roof.

Both Orthodox and Protestant Christianity have large representations in southern and western Ethiopia.

Abyssinia is also mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]]. While many Ethiopians claim that the Bible references of Kush apply to their own ancient civilization, pointing out that the [[Gihon]] river, a name for the [[Nile]], is said to flow through the land, some scholars believe that the use of the term referred to the [[Kingdom of Kush]] in particular, or Africa outside of Egypt in general. The modern name ''Ethiopia'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''[[Aethiopia]]'' used to translate ''Kush'', and was applied to all of Sub-Saharan Africa, including what is now [[Sudan]], but with a few classical geographers giving more detailed descriptions of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea (e.g. [[Adulis]]) as well.\n\n===Islam===\n{{main|Islam in Ethiopia}}\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img33 Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mosque]] in [[Mekelle]].]]\n[[Islam in Ethiopia]] dates back to the founding of the religion; in 615, when a group of Muslims were counseled by Muhammad to escape persecution in [[Mecca]] and [[Migration to Abyssinia|travel to Ethiopia via modern-day Eritrea]], which was ruled by [[Ashama ibn Abjar]], a pious Christian king.

While many Ethiopians claim that the Bible references of Kush apply to their own ancient civilization, pointing out that the [[Gihon]] river, a name for the [[Nile]], is said to flow through the land, some scholars believe that the use of the term referred to the [[Kingdom of Kush]] in particular, or Africa outside of Egypt in general. The modern name ''Ethiopia'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''[[Aethiopia]]'' used to translate ''Kush'', and was applied to all of Sub-Saharan Africa, including what is now [[Sudan]], but with a few classical geographers giving more detailed descriptions of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea (e.g. [[Adulis]]) as well.\n\n===Islam===\n{{main|Islam in Ethiopia}}\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img33 Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mosque]] in [[Mekelle]].]]\n[[Islam in Ethiopia]] dates back to the founding of the religion; in 615, when a group of Muslims were counseled by Muhammad to escape persecution in [[Mecca]] and [[Migration to Abyssinia|travel to Ethiopia via modern-day Eritrea]], which was ruled by [[Ashama ibn Abjar]], a pious Christian king.

The 2002 winner of the [[Boston Underground Film Festival]] (BUFF) Bachus Award, The Neuchatel Sci-Fi Fest Audience Choice Award, and much critical acclaim for its razor sharp, if quite demented social satire, it was created by taking an old [[science fiction|sci-fi]] movie\u2014''[[Killers from Space]]''\u2014overdubbing the soundtrack with humorous dialogue, and adding some new scenes, essentially turning it into an entirely different movie. The plot involves alien invaders with a machine that turns [[Heterosexuality|straight]] people [[homosexuality|gay]].\n\n==Plot==\nScientist Doug Fartin (who insists that his name is pronounced \u201cFar-''tan''\u201d) is in charge of Operation Manhole, a project to eliminate all homosexuals in the military by luring them to a specific spot and then dropping a bomb on them.  The bomb, however, misses its target and instead obliterates part of the nearby town of [[inbreeding|Inbred]], [[Texas]].  The plane is then struck by an invisible force and crashes to earth, and its occupants\u2014Dr. Fartin and the pilot\u2014are presumed dead.\n\nFartin, however, was saved from the plane by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] with bulging eyeballs, who then performed an operation on him.

She tries her best to sexually arouse him, but he can only have sex with her while imagining that she's [[Ted Kennedy]].\n\nThe next day, Doug Fartin\u2014whose security clearance has been revoked because of his new gayness\u2014steals a piece of paper from a vault in Butz's office.  Upon hearing of this, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Priggs tries to figure out what was stolen, which isn't easy because the vault is highly disorganized and mostly filled with take-out menus.  Priggs discovers a handful of [[marijuana]] on the floor in front of the vault, and immediately recognizes it as part of Fartin's stash.\n\nDoug arrives at [[Sodomy|Sodom]] Flats with the paper, but is caught and confronted by Priggs.  Doug punches Priggs out and tries to escape in his car, but a hallucination of bulging eyeballs causes him to run off the road and crash.  Regaining consciousness in the base infirmary, Fartin remembers what happened to him after the plane went down, and tells his story to Butz and the others:\n\nThe aliens, who are from [[Uranus]] (\u201can all-gay planet\u201d), have been the ones responsible for creating homosexuals on Earth and other planets.  Over the centuries, they've monitored these planets and tried to snuff out [[homophobia]].  The last time they\u2019d visited Earth was during [[World War II]], when their agents abducted [[Adolf Hitler]] and turned him into a [[cross-dressing]] [[lounge singer]] on another planet; the Germans set up an [[imposter]] in Hitler's place, but when the imposter ordered the invasion of [[Russia]], the aliens knew that [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] was doomed, so they left.\n\nNow the aliens have returned, with a new mission: to build a machine whose transmissions will cause everyone on Earth to become homosexual.  They had ordered Fartin to return to the military base, steal from the vault the bottom half of page 32 from the original manuscript of ''[[Giovanni's Room]]'', and bring it to the aliens\u2019 subterranean headquarters at Sodom Flats.  Fartin rightly concluded that there's something on the paper that the aliens needed to complete their machine and refused to cooperate, but the alien leader\u2014the Super-Homo\u2014[[hypnosis|hypnotized]] Doug to ensure his complicity.\n\nAfter hearing Fartin's story, Butz and his associates aren't sure about Doug's sanity.  Later, Sheriff [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolino]] of Inbred (who's been turned into a bulging-eyed agent of the aliens) materializes in Fartin's room and tells him that the aliens now need a power source for their machine; Fartin, who is now convinced that helping the aliens is the right thing to do, goes to the nearby [[power station]] and orders the technician, at gunpoint, to move certain levers and switches (one of which causes the camera filming this movie to temporarily falter).  Butz, Problemo, Priggs, Vagina, and others try to stop Doug, but they're too late; everyone looks out the window and witnesses a huge explosion, the radiation from which changes the sexuality of everyone on Earth, turning straight people gay and gay people\u2014such as Doug Fartin\u2014straight.\n\n==Notes==\n* This film incorporates part of the independent short film ''Titler'', in which a cross-dressing Adolf Hitler is singing about coming out of the closet.
