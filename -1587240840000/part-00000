At that time the land consisted of farms, [[market garden]]s and [[orchard]]s; there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" approximately where the modern Terminal 2 is situated, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House.\" This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road), which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\n\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a much larger airport began in 1944. It was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East; by the time the airfield was nearing completion, [[World War II]] had ended, and the UK Government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as London Airport and was renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966. The layout for the airport was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]], who designed the original terminals and central area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith Chapel of St George's.\n\n==Operations==\n===Facilities===\n[[File:TerminalFiveAirportHeathrowAugust2012.JPG|thumb|Central waiting area in [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]\n[[File:Concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow]]\n[[File:Four aircraft on the approach to LHR runway 09L 10Sep2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Four aircraft on the approach to Heathrow runway 09L]]\n[[File:London Heathrow tower and Virgin B747 (5048342074) (2).jpg|thumb|Heathrow's control tower with a departing [[Virgin Atlantic]] [[Boeing 747-400]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|British Airways aircraft at [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5C]]]]\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries. The airport is the primary [[Airline hub|hub]] of British Airways and is a base for [[Virgin Atlantic]]. It has four passenger terminals (numbered 2 to 5) and a cargo terminal. Of Heathrow's 78&nbsp;million passengers in 2017, 94% were international travellers; the remaining 6% were bound for (or arriving from) places in the UK.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=13 March 2019|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvLjhZ76?url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/facts-and-figures|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3&nbsp;million passengers flying between Heathrow and JFK Airport in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2013|page=68|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=12 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704161033/https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a [[hexagram]] with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field; two of its runways would always be within 30\u00b0 of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east\u2013west. These are extended versions of the two east\u2013west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways.

Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby landings are allocated to one runway and takeoffs to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the takeoff runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded [[Cranford Agreement]], pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.\n\nNight-time flights at Heathrow are subject to [[Night flying restrictions|restrictions]]. Between 23:00 and 04:00, the noisiest aircraft (rated [[Quota Count system|QC]]/8 and QC/16) cannot be scheduled for operation. Also, during the night quota period (23:30\u201306:00) there are four limits:\n*A limit on the number of flights allowed;\n*A [[Quota Count system]] which limits the total amount of noise permitted, but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes;<ref name=\"Ref_p\">{{cite web|title=Noise limits|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=27 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225040213/http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|archive-date=25 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*QC/4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation.\n*A voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 04:30.\n\nA trial of \"noise relief zones\" ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out.

In 1991, Pan Am and TWA sold their rights to [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom concerning its EU membership, and as a consequence, the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004.

The airport is located within the [[Hayes and Harlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hayes and Harlington]] parliamentary constituency.\n\nAs the airport is located west of London and as its runways run east\u2013west, an airliner's landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of London when the wind is from the west, which is most of the time.\n\nAlong with [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]], [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] and [[London City Airport|London City]], Heathrow is one of six airports with scheduled services serving the London area.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Heathrow Airport, 1955.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of Heathrow Airport from the 1950s, before the terminals were built]]\n[[File:EI-DWI LHR (7079539739).jpg|thumb|right|Heathrow in 2009, much expanded from its original layout.]]\n<!-- The history of Heathrow Airport is now described in [[History of Heathrow Airport]].

At that time the land consisted of farms, [[market garden]]s and [[orchard]]s; there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" approximately where the modern Terminal 2 is situated, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House.\" This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road), which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\n\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a much larger airport began in 1944. It was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East; by the time the airfield was nearing completion, [[World War II]] had ended, and the UK Government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as London Airport and was renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966. The layout for the airport was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]], who designed the original terminals and central area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith Chapel of St George's.\n\n==Operations==\n===Facilities===\n[[File:TerminalFiveAirportHeathrowAugust2012.JPG|thumb|Central waiting area in [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]\n[[File:Concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow]]\n[[File:Four aircraft on the approach to LHR runway 09L 10Sep2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Four aircraft on the approach to Heathrow runway 09L]]\n[[File:London Heathrow tower and Virgin B747 (5048342074) (2).jpg|thumb|Heathrow's control tower with a departing [[Virgin Atlantic]] [[Boeing 747-400]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|British Airways aircraft at [[Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5C]]]]\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 80 airlines flying to 185 destinations in 84 countries. The airport is the primary [[Airline hub|hub]] of British Airways and is a base for [[Virgin Atlantic]]. It has four passenger terminals (numbered 2 to 5) and a cargo terminal. Of Heathrow's 78&nbsp;million passengers in 2017, 94% were international travellers; the remaining 6% were bound for (or arriving from) places in the UK.<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=13 March 2019|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvLjhZ76?url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/facts-and-figures|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3&nbsp;million passengers flying between Heathrow and JFK Airport in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf|title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2013|page=68|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=12 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704161033/https://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2013Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2013.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a [[hexagram]] with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field; two of its runways would always be within 30\u00b0 of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east\u2013west. These are extended versions of the two east\u2013west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways.

Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby landings are allocated to one runway and takeoffs to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the takeoff runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded [[Cranford Agreement]], pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.\n\nNight-time flights at Heathrow are subject to [[Night flying restrictions|restrictions]]. Between 23:00 and 04:00, the noisiest aircraft (rated [[Quota Count system|QC]]/8 and QC/16) cannot be scheduled for operation. Also, during the night quota period (23:30\u201306:00) there are four limits:\n*A limit on the number of flights allowed;\n*A [[Quota Count system]] which limits the total amount of noise permitted, but allows operators to choose to operate fewer noisy aircraft or a greater number of quieter planes;<ref name=\"Ref_p\">{{cite web|title=Noise limits|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|publisher=Heathrow Airport|accessdate=27 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225040213/http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/what-we-do-about-it/measures-already-in-place/noise-limits|archive-date=25 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*QC/4 aircraft cannot be scheduled for operation.\n*A voluntary agreement with the airlines that no early morning arrivals will be scheduled to land before 04:30.\n\nA trial of \"noise relief zones\" ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out.

The treaty originally allowed only British Airways, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] to fly from Heathrow to the US. In 1991, Pan Am and TWA sold their rights to [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom concerning its EU membership, and as a consequence, the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004. A new \"[[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement|open skies]]\" agreement was signed by the United States and the [[European Union]] on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

The film is about the murders of a [[serial killer]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], told through interviews and footage from a cache of the killer's [[snuff film]]s.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], but had a troubled release history; it was originally slated for theatrical release by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in February 2008, but was removed from the release schedule. The film had a brief [[video-on-demand]] release in 2014, but remained unavailable on home media.<ref name=donovan>{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3922884|title='The Poughkeepsie Tapes' Is One Of The Best Horror Films You May Never See|last=Donovan|first=Paul|date=June 30, 2016|work=[[Moviepilot]]|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref> In October 2017, the film was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] by [[Scream Factory]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{hatnote|The killer is not identified by name in the film, but is credited as \"Edward Carver\" (he also states that his name is Ed when he is picked up as a hitchhiker). For simplicity, that name is used in this summary.}}\n\nWhen police raid a house in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], they discover over 800 videotapes shot by serial killer Edward Carver, which present a visual record of his murders. Both state and federal law enforcement teams look for clues of his identity, his victims, and where he could have gone. \n\nCarver films all stages of his killings, beginning with abduction and ending with postmortem mutilation. He is careful never to be shown on film unless entirely disguised. The first tape displays his first and most vulnerable victim: an eight-year-old girl who he abducts, rapes, and murders. After the success of his first crime, Carver becomes more meticulous. He convinces a couple, the Andersons, to give him a ride. He clubs the man and subdues the woman with [[chloroform]]. He then performs a [[Cesarian section]] on the woman, placing the severed head of her husband inside her womb before sewing her up, waking her, and filming her reaction. Carver shows himself in the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage of another gas station, using sign language to reveal the location of the bodies.\n\nCarver's next victim is teenager Cheryl Dempsey. He murders and mutilates her boyfriend Tim and imprisons Cheryl in his basement, abusing her sexually, physically and psychologically as his \"slave\". Cheryl's mother appeals to her kidnapper in a televised statement. He goes to see her, offering to help while filming her. Victoria realizes that he is her daughter's captor and stands shocked as he laughs and flees.\n\nWith attention rising, Carver changes his ''[[modus operandi]]'' and begins targeting prostitutes while posing as a police officer; he is dubbed the \"Water Street Butcher.\" Police investigation leads them to officer James Foley. Because Foley has a history of visiting prostitutes, no alibi, eyewitness statements and matching sperm samples, he is convicted and sentenced to death in 1996. Foley continues to plead his innocence and refuses to make any [[Plea bargain|plea deals]]. He is executed by [[lethal injection]] on September 9, 2001. Days later, his former partner finds a map in his mailbox with the location of another body. The real killer had presumably taken Foley's sperm from a fertility clinic and framed him. Foley is exonerated of the murders on September 12; because of the proximity to the [[September 11 attacks]], this goes unrecognized by the public.\n\nAfter another murder, the police reverse-engineer the killer's map search and Cheryl is discovered in his empty house. She is rescued but is irreversibly damaged from her ordeal, suffering from malnourishment and harming herself in secret. In an interview, she [[Stockholm syndrome|identifies with her captor]] and defends him, saying that he loved her. Two weeks later, she commits suicide. Her body is exhumed after its burial, with a tape left in her empty coffin. The investigators ponder where Carver is and assert that he will watch the documentary. A [[post-credits scene]] shows a restrained woman being filmed by Carver, who says she will be allowed to live for as long as she does not blink.Big boobies\n\n== Cast ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Stacy Chbosky as Cheryl Dempsey\n* Ben Messmer as Edward Carver\n* [[Ivar Brogger]] as Leonard Schway\n* Lou George as Felton Lewis\n* Michael Lawson as Simon Alray\n* [[Samantha Robson]] as Samantha Baker\n* [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]] as Mike Moakes\n* Kim Kenny as Pam Frears\n* [[Iris Bahr]] as Aretha Creely\n* Lisa Black as Victoria Dempsey\n* Bill Bookston as James Foley\n* [[Jules Bruff]] as Joanne Blackwell\n* [[Todd Cahoon]] as [[Ted Bundy]]\n* Meredith Cross as Jeannette Anderson\n* [[Henry Dittman]] as Frank Anderson\n* Dennis Garber as Joseph Danvers\n* Chip Godwin as Hank Foley\n* [[David Haack]] as Tim Surrey\n* [[Keisuke Hoashi]] as Dai Loung\n}}\n\n== Release ==\n''The Poughkeepsie Tapes'' premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in May 2007.<ref name=bd2007>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/110628/the-poughkeepsie-tapes-2/|title=The Poughkeepsie Tapes|date=May 5, 2007|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=December 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607194341/https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/110628/the-poughkeepsie-tapes-2/|archive-date=June 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/indie/3303716/pigs-fly-poughkeepsie-tapes-now-vod/|title=Pigs Fly: \u2018The Poughkeepsie Tapes\u2019 Now On VOD!|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=July 19, 2014|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=December 8, 2019}}</ref> It was scheduled for a theatrical release by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) on February 8, 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|work=The Hollywood Reporter|volume= 403|page=200|title=Weekend box office|quote=Looking to next weekend, wide-openers will include MGM horror film \"The Poughkeepsie Tapes\"...|date=February 4, 2008}}</ref> The film, however, was removed from the release schedule, in spite of promotional advertising.<ref name=donovan/>\n\nIn July 2014, the film was given its first official release as a [[video-on-demand]] title available through [[DirecTV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/indie/3303716/pigs-fly-poughkeepsie-tapes-now-vod/|title=Pigs Fly: 'The Poughkeepsie Tapes' Now On VOD!|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=July 19, 2014|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> It was subsequently pulled again less than a month later with Dowdle suggesting that MGM was considering a wider release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/361107-the-poughkeepsie-tapes-pulled-from-vod-heres-why/|title=The Poughkeepsie Tapes Pulled from VOD, Here's Why\u2026|last=Turek|first=Ryan|date=July 26, 2014|website=Shock Till You Drop|access-date=April 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''The Poughkeepsie Tapes'' has an approval rating of 60% on the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 6.06/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_poughkeepsie_tapes|title=The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2009)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=December 8, 2019}}</ref> Michael Gingold of ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'' called the film \"a creepy yet frustrating experience\", criticizing it for not giving enough \"insight into the reasons why [the villain] brutalized and slew his victims\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rue-morgue.com/blu-raydvd-review-the-poughkeepsie-tapes-dont-quite-reveal-enough/|title=Blu-ray/DVD Review: \u201cThe Poughkeepsie Tapes\u201d Don't Quite Reveal Enough|last=Gingold|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2017|work=[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]|access-date=December 8, 2019}}</ref> Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com gave the film a rating of 4 out of 10 stars, writing that the film \"teases a few interesting directions\" but \"loses tension the longer it recycles the same beats of distress, selecting a cheap way to disturb its audience.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/The-Poughkeepsie-Tapes/357209/#Review|title=The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2007) Review|last=Orndorf|first=Brian|date=August 7, 2014|website=Blu-ray.com|access-date=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Bloody Disgusting]] gave the film a score of 4 out of 5, calling it \"one of the best indie films\" of 2007 and writing that \"the movie is scary, creepy, unnerving, bizarre and very uncomfortable to watch.\"<ref name=bd2007 /> Michele \"Izzy\" Galgana of [[Screen Anarchy]] called it \"definitely not a film for everyone, particularly those who have a low threshold for violence and torture.
