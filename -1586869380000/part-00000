{"title_page": "List of Israeli highways", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of Israeli highways'''. Besides [[highway]]s in [[Israel]] proper, it includes highways in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Golan Heights]], because the Israeli administration maintains them in these areas.\n\nThere are 48 designated Israeli highways. Most of these are open-access arterial expressways, which may be entered from ordinary junctions. Some are limited-access freeways, which may be entered from [[Interchange (road)|interchange]]s. Six highways are freeways, six are partially limited-access freeways and partially expressways, and the other 35 are expressways.  There is only one three-digit road in the country classified as a freeway, [[Route 431 (Israel)|Route 431]]. [[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]], the Trans-Israel Highway, is the only [[toll road]].\n\nTwo of the expressways ([[Highway 57 (Israel and Palestine)|Highway 57]] and [[Highway 60 (Israel\u2013Palestine)|Highway 60]]) are divided into several separate sections as a result of an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] decree forbidding [[Israelis]] from traveling on certain stretches of these highways (see Notes below).\n\n==1\u201399==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=1 cellpadding=1\n!Road\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Classification\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Start

article}}\nThis is a '''list of Israeli highways'''. Besides [[highway]]s in [[Israel]] proper, it includes highways in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Golan Heights]], because the Israeli administration maintains them in these areas.\n\nThere are 48 designated Israeli highways. Most of these are open-access arterial expressways, which may be entered from ordinary junctions. Some are limited-access freeways, which may be entered from [[Interchange (road)|interchange]]s. Six highways are freeways, six are partially limited-access freeways and partially expressways, and the other 35 are expressways.  There is only one three-digit road in the country classified as a freeway, [[Route 431 (Israel)|Route 431]]. [[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]], the Trans-Israel Highway, is the only [[toll road]].\n\nTwo of the expressways ([[Highway 57 (Israel and Palestine)|Highway 57]] and [[Highway 60 (Israel\u2013Palestine)|Highway 60]]) are divided into several separate sections as a result of an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] decree forbidding [[Israelis]] from traveling on certain stretches of these highways (see Notes below).\n\n==1\u201399==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=1 cellpadding=1\n!Road\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Classification\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Start

They employ a two rail [[parapet]] which optimises views of the landscape. The bridges were designed with the natural surroundings in mind and form a simple uncluttered shape so not to detract from the natural bushland of the national park. The three span haunched [[girder]]s on the bridge were critical to this as were the multiple [[pier]]s that provide character and strength.<ref name=\"rtabadg\">{{cite web |work=NSW Roads & Traffic Authority |title=Bridge Aesthetics \u2013 Design guidelines to improve the appearance of bridges in NSW |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/downloads/urbandesign/rta_bridges_final_1.pdf | accessdate=14 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=488537280631911;res=IELENG |title=Design of Balanced Cantilever Bridges at Mooney Mooney Creek |author1=Judd, B.

They employ a two rail [[parapet]] which optimises views of the landscape. The bridges were designed with the natural surroundings in mind and form a simple uncluttered shape so not to detract from the natural bushland of the national park.
