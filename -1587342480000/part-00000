It developed as a [[linear village]] along the Great Conestoga Road, stretching about two miles along path later known as the [[Strasburg Road]].<ref name=\"nom\">Susan M. Zacher, [{{NRHP-PA|H000795_01H.pdf}} NRHP Nomination Form Strasburg]</ref> The population was 2,809 at the 2010 census. \nThe town was named after the French city of [[Strasbourg]], the native home of an early settler.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyAxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s-IFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5721%2C5662865 | title=Early history | work=Reading Eagle | date=Jun 9, 1896 | accessdate=18 October 2015 | pages=25}}</ref>\nThe town is often called \"Train Town USA\" because of the many railroad attractions in and around town, including the [[Strasburg Rail Road]] and the [[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]]. Much of the movie ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' was filmed on a farm nearby.  Much of the borough was listed as a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] by the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Strasburg Historic District (Strasburg, Pennsylvania)}}\nThe Old Conestoga Road was in use by 1714, and by 1750 a tavern and some log houses were built near the current site of Strasburg.  Strasburg grew as the trade over the road with Philadelphia grew. By 1759, there were 32 taxable properties in the town, including about ten hotels. Many early settlers were [[Huguenot]]s or Swiss or German [[Mennonite]]s and several church congregations of various faiths formed during the 1760s.  The first church was built in 1807 by Methodists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.lancaster.pa.us/strasburg_boro/cwp/view.asp?A=3&Q=519767|title=History, Strasburg Borough|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Strasburg E Main 109.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Old brick house on East Main Street]]\nThe Old Conestoga Road was the main path connecting [[Philadelphia]] to the west, but in 1792 the new [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]] was built, bypassing Strasburg four miles to the north.  However, in 1793 construction on the new [[Strasburg Road]] started, roughly following the old road, passing through [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]] on the way to Philadelphia.  It attracted traffic because it was not a toll-road, unlike the Philadelphia Turnpike.  This road later developed into [[Pennsylvania Route 741|PA 741]].<ref name=\"nom\"/>\n\nBy 1815 there were 90 houses in Strasburg, about half of which were two stories, indicating a relatively well-off population. There were 53 log, 29 brick, and 4 limestone houses.  About half of the log houses survive today, as well as 12 of the brick houses and all 4 of the stone houses. About 150 other houses stand in the historic district, nearly all built before 1900.<ref name=\"nom\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nStrasburg is located at {{coord|39|58|56|N|76|10|58|W|type:city}} (39.982300, -76.182713).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.0|sqmi}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 445\n|1850= 880\n|1860= 921\n|1870= 1008\n|1880= 1005\n|1890= 918\n|1900= 916\n|1910= 885\n|1920= 853\n|1930= 975\n|1940= 1706\n|1950= 1890\n|1960= 2081\n|1970= 1897\n|1980= 1999\n|1990= 2568\n|2000= 2800\n|2010= 2809\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2983\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 2, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|df=}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 2,800 people, 1,110 households, and 798 families residing in the borough.

It developed as a [[linear village]] along the Great Conestoga Road, stretching about two miles along path later known as the [[Strasburg Road]].<ref name=\"nom\">Susan M. Zacher, [{{NRHP-PA|H000795_01H.pdf}} NRHP Nomination Form Strasburg]</ref> The population was 2,809 at the 2010 census. \nThe town was named after the French city of [[Strasbourg]], the native home of an early settler.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyAxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s-IFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5721%2C5662865 | title=Early history | work=Reading Eagle | date=Jun 9, 1896 | accessdate=18 October 2015 | pages=25}}</ref>\nThe town is often called \"Train Town USA\" because of the many railroad attractions in and around town, including the [[Strasburg Rail Road]] and the [[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]]. Much of the movie ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' was filmed on a farm nearby.  Much of the borough was listed as a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] by the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Strasburg Historic District (Strasburg, Pennsylvania)}}\nThe Old Conestoga Road was in use by 1714, and by 1750 a tavern and some log houses were built near the current site of Strasburg.  Strasburg grew as the trade over the road with Philadelphia grew. By 1759, there were 32 taxable properties in the town, including about ten hotels. Many early settlers were [[Huguenot]]s or Swiss or German [[Mennonite]]s and several church congregations of various faiths formed during the 1760s.  The first church was built in 1807 by Methodists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.lancaster.pa.us/strasburg_boro/cwp/view.asp?A=3&Q=519767|title=History, Strasburg Borough|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Strasburg E Main 109.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Old brick house on East Main Street]]\nThe Old Conestoga Road was the main path connecting [[Philadelphia]] to the west, but in 1792 the new [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]] was built, bypassing Strasburg four miles to the north.  However, in 1793 construction on the new [[Strasburg Road]] started, roughly following the old road, passing through [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]] on the way to Philadelphia.  It attracted traffic because it was not a toll-road, unlike the Philadelphia Turnpike.  This road later developed into [[Pennsylvania Route 741|PA 741]].<ref name=\"nom\"/>\n\nBy 1815 there were 90 houses in Strasburg, about half of which were two stories, indicating a relatively well-off population. There were 53 log, 29 brick, and 4 limestone houses.  About half of the log houses survive today, as well as 12 of the brick houses and all 4 of the stone houses. About 150 other houses stand in the historic district, nearly all built before 1900.<ref name=\"nom\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nStrasburg is located at {{coord|39|58|56|N|76|10|58|W|type:city}} (39.982300, -76.182713).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.0|sqmi}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 445\n|1850= 880\n|1860= 921\n|1870= 1008\n|1880= 1005\n|1890= 918\n|1900= 916\n|1910= 885\n|1920= 853\n|1930= 975\n|1940= 1706\n|1950= 1890\n|1960= 2081\n|1970= 1897\n|1980= 1999\n|1990= 2568\n|2000= 2800\n|2010= 2809\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2983\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 2, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|df=}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 2,800 people, 1,110 households, and 798 families residing in the borough.

The K6-III was heavily based on the preceding K6-2 - it essentially was a K6-2 core with a full speed 256KiB [[L2 cache]] integrated on the same die. This gave a very significant improvement in system performance over a K6-2 system. \n\nAt its release, the fastest available desktop processor from Intel was the Pentium II 450&nbsp;MHz, and in integer application benchmarks a 400&nbsp;MHz K6-III was able to beat it as the fastest processor available for business applications <ref>https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/02/24/intel_pentium_iii_vs_amd/</ref>.  Just days later on February 26 Intel released the [[Pentium III#Katmai|Pentium III \"Katmai\"]] line at speeds of 500&nbsp;MHz, slightly faster than the K6-III 450&nbsp;MHz. However a K6-III system when equipped with a 1MB L3 cache on the motherboard was found by [[Ars Technica]] to allow the 400 and 450&nbsp;MHz K6-IIIs to often outperform<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/4q99/intelvsamd.html|title=Ars Technica: Intel vs. AMD - (10/99)|website=arstechnica.com|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref> the more expensive Pentium III \"Katmai\" 450- and 500-MHz models, respectively.\n\nIt is important to note however that Intel retained the lead in 3D gaming performance. Many popular [[Quake_(video_game)|first person]] games at the time were specifically tuned to extract maximum performance from Intel's [[Pipeline_(computing)|pipelined]] floating point unit in drawing their 3D environments. Since the K6-III inherits the same floating point unit as the K6-2 (low latency but not pipelined), unless the game was updated to use AMD's 3D-Now! [[SIMD]] instructions - performance could still remain significantly lower than when run on Intel.\n\nThe K6-III was the last processor officially released for desktop [[Socket 7]] systems, however later mobile K6-III+ and K6-2+ processors could be unofficially run in certain socket 7 motherboards if an updated bios was made available for a given board.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[Image:Amdk6III arch.svg|300px|thumb|The AMD K6-III architecture.]]\nIn conception, the design is simple: it was a [[K6-2]] with on-die 256KiB L2 [[CPU cache|cache]]. In execution, however, the design was not simple, with 21.4 million transistors. The pipeline was short compared to that of the Pentium III and thus the design did not scale well past 500&nbsp;MHz. Nevertheless, the K6-III 400 sold well, and the AMD K6-III 450 was clearly the fastest x86 chip on the market on introduction, comfortably outperforming AMD K6-2s and Intel Pentium IIs.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/211/5 AMD K6-3 Review - Windows 98 Performance Comparison] by Anand Lal Shimpi on anandtech.com</ref>\n\n===3DNow!===\n\n{{ details|3DNow! }}\n\n3DNow! is an extension to the x86 [[instruction set]] developed by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD). It added [[SIMD|single instruction multiple data]] (SIMD) instructions to the base x86 instruction set, enabling it to perform [[vector processing]], which improves the performance of many graphic-intensive applications. The first microprocessor to implement 3DNow was the [[AMD K6-2]], which was introduced in 1998.\n\nThe K6-III+ had the \"Enhanced 3DNow!\"(Extended 3DNow! or 3DNow+) which added 5 new [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] instructions, but not the 19 new extended MMX instructions.\n\n===TriLevel Cache===\nThe original K6-2 had a 64 KB primary cache and a much larger amount of motherboard-mounted cache (usually 512 KB or 1024 KB but varying depending on the choice of motherboard). The K6-III, with its 256 KB on-die secondary cache, re-purposed the variable-size external cache on the motherboard as the L3 cache. This scheme was termed \"TriLevel Cache\" by AMD. The L3 cache has a capacity of up to 2 MB.\n\n==Market performance==\nIntel's Pentium II replacement was not yet available but, as a stop-gap, Intel introduced a modestly revised version of the [[Pentium II]] and re-badged it as the \"[[Pentium III]]\". The base design was unchanged (the addition of [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instructions was at that time of no performance significance) but Intel's new production process allowed clockspeed improvements, and it became difficult to determine which company's part was the faster.\n\nBoth firms were keen to establish a clear lead, and both experienced manufacturing problems with their higher-frequency parts. AMD chose not to sell a 500&nbsp;MHz or faster K6-III after the rare 500&nbsp;MHz K6-III had been immediately recalled; it was found to be drawing enough current to damage some motherboards. AMD preferred to concentrate on their soon-to-be-released [[Athlon]] instead. Intel produced a 550&nbsp;MHz Pentium III with some success but their 600&nbsp;MHz version had reliability issues and was soon recalled.\n\nWith the release of the [[Athlon]], the K6-III became something of an orphan. No longer a competitive CPU in its intended market segment, it nevertheless required substantial manufacturing resources to produce: in spite of its 21.4 million transistors, its 118&nbsp;mm\u00b2 die was considerably smaller than the 184&nbsp;mm\u00b2 of the 22-million-transistor Athlon (cache RAM taking much less area per-transistor than logic), but the K6-III was still significantly more costly to produce than the 81&nbsp;mm\u00b2 9.3 million-transistor K6-2 CPUs. (roughly 2/3 the size of the K6-III) For a time, the K6-III was a low priority part for AMD&mdash;something to be made only when all orders for high-priced Athlons and cheap-to-produce K6-2s had been filled&mdash;and it became difficult to obtain in significant quantities.\n\nThe original K6-III went out of production when Intel released their \"[[Pentium III#Coppermine|Coppermine]]\" Pentium III (a much improved part that used an on-die cache) and, at the same time, switched to a new production process. The changeover was fraught with difficulties and Intel CPUs were in global short supply for 12 months or more. This, coupled with the better performance of the Athlon, resulted in even many former Intel-only manufacturers ordering Athlon parts, and stretched AMD's manufacturing facilities to the limit. In consequence, AMD stopped making the K6-III in order to leave more room to manufacture Athlons (and K6-2s).\n\n=== K6-III+ and K6-2+ ===\nBy the time the x86 CPU shortage was over, AMD had developed and released revised members of the K6 family. These K6-2+ and K6-III+ variants were specifically designed as low-power mobile (laptop) CPUs, and significantly marked the transition of the K6 architecture (and foretold of AMD's future K7 project) to the new 180&nbsp;nm production process. Functionally, both parts were die shrunk K6-IIIs (the 2+ disabled 128&nbsp;KiB of cache, the III+ had the full 256 KiB) and introduced AMD's new [[PowerNow!]] power saving technology. PowerNow! offered processor power savings for mobile applications by measuring computational load, and reduced processor operational voltage and frequency during idle periods in order to reduce overall system power consumption.\n\nAlthough intended for notebook computers, both parts found an enthusiast following also in desktop systems as some motherboard companies (such as Gigabyte and FIC) provided [[BIOS#Reprogramming|BIOS]] updates for their desktop motherboards to allow usage of these processors. For other officially not supported mainboards, the enthusiast community created [[Unofficial patch|unofficial BIOS updates]] on their own.<ref>[http://wims.rainbow-software.org/index.php?count=250 M577 BIOS 03/06/1999 with K6-2+/III+ & HDD up to 128GB] by Ondrej Zary on rainbow-software.org</ref><ref>[http://www.ryston.cz/petr/bios/ Award BIOS Modifications] by Petr Soucek on ryston.cz</ref><ref>[http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/J.Steunebrink/k6plus.htm K6plus] by Jan Steunebrink on inter.nl.net</ref> These boards became firm favorites within the [[overclocking]] community. Both the K6-III+ and K6-2+ 450&nbsp;MHz CPUs were routinely overclocked to over 600&nbsp;MHz (112*5.5=616). Unfortunately, even with the 180&nbsp;nm process shrink, the K6 architecture's short 6-stage pipeline while efficient, was difficult to scale with regards to clock speed. K6 III+ and 2+ were never offered higher than 570&nbsp;MHz officially, and [[overclocking]] efforts using air cooling achieved a maximum around 800&nbsp;MHz (133x6) at best - however this constraint was also exacerbated by a lack of Socket 7 motherboards supporting stable speeds over 112&nbsp;MHz [[front-side bus|FSB]].\n\nAs AMD's marketing resources at the time were focused on the launch of the upcoming Athlon K7 processor line, the 180&nbsp;nm K6 series were relatively unknown outside of the industry.\n\n== Features  ==\n[[Template:AMD x86 CPU features|CPU features table]]\n\n== Models ==\n===K6-III (\"Sharptooth\", K6-3D+, 250 nm)===\n[[File:AMD K6 3.jpg|thumb|AMD K6-III 400&nbsp;MHz Microprocessor]]\n* CPU ID: AuthenticAMD Family 5 Model 9 \n* L1-Cache: 32 + 32 KiB (Data + Instructions)\n* L2-Cache: 256 KiB, full speed\n* [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], [[3DNow!]]\n* Socket 7, [[Super Socket 7|Super7]]\n* [[Front side bus]]: 66/100, 100&nbsp;MHz\n* VCore: 2.2 V, 2.4 V\n* First release: February 22, 1999\n* Manufacturing process: 0.25&nbsp;\u03bcm\n* Clockrate: 333, 400, 450&nbsp;MHz\n\n===K6-III-P (250 nm, mobile)===\n* CPU ID: AuthenticAMD Family 5 Model 9 \n* L1-Cache: 32 + 32 KiB (Data + Instructions)\n* L2-Cache: 256 KiB, full speed\n* [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], 3DNow!\n* Socket 7, Super7\n* [[Front side bus]]: 66, 95, 96.2, 66/100, 100&nbsp;MHz\n* VCore: 2.0 V, 2.2 V\n* First release: May 31, 1999\n* Manufacturing process: 0.25&nbsp;\u03bcm\n* Clockrate: 350, 366, 380, 400, 433, 450, 475&nbsp;MHz\n\n===K6-2+ (180 nm, mobile)===\n[[File:AMD K6 2 Plus.jpg|thumb|AMD K6-2+ 475&nbsp;MHz Microprocessor]]\n* CPU ID: AuthenticAMD Family 5 Model 13\n* L1-Cache: 32 + 32 KiB (Data + Instructions)\n* L2-Cache: 128 KiB, full speed\n* [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], Extended 3DNow!, [[PowerNow!]]\n* Super Socket 7\n* Front side bus: 95, 97, 100&nbsp;MHz\n* VCore: 2.0 V\n* First release: April 18, 2000\n* Manufacturing process: 0.18&nbsp;\u03bcm\n* Clockrate: 450, 475, 500, 533, 550&nbsp;MHz.

The L3 cache has a capacity of up to 2 MB.\n\n==Market performance==\nIntel's Pentium II replacement was not yet available but, as a stop-gap, Intel introduced a modestly revised version of the [[Pentium II]] and re-badged it as the \"[[Pentium III]]\". The base design was unchanged (the addition of [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instructions was at that time of no performance significance) but Intel's new production process allowed clockspeed improvements, and it became difficult to determine which company's part was the faster.\n\nBoth firms were keen to establish a clear lead, and both experienced manufacturing problems with their higher-frequency parts. AMD chose not to sell a 500&nbsp;MHz or faster K6-III after the rare 500&nbsp;MHz K6-III had been immediately recalled; it was found to be drawing enough current to damage some motherboards. AMD preferred to concentrate on their soon-to-be-released [[Athlon]] instead. Intel produced a 550&nbsp;MHz Pentium III with some success but their 600&nbsp;MHz version had reliability issues and was soon recalled.\n\nWith the release of the [[Athlon]], the K6-III became something of an orphan. No longer a competitive CPU in its intended market segment, it nevertheless required substantial manufacturing resources to produce: in spite of its 21.4 million transistors, its 118&nbsp;mm\u00b2 die was considerably smaller than the 184&nbsp;mm\u00b2 of the 22-million-transistor Athlon (cache RAM taking much less area per-transistor than logic), but the K6-III was still significantly more costly to produce than the 81&nbsp;mm\u00b2 9.3 million-transistor K6-2 CPUs. (roughly 2/3 the size of the K6-III) For a time, the K6-III was a low priority part for AMD&mdash;something to be made only when all orders for high-priced Athlons and cheap-to-produce K6-2s had been filled&mdash;and it became difficult to obtain in significant quantities.\n\nThe original K6-III went out of production when Intel released their \"[[Pentium III#Coppermine|Coppermine]]\" Pentium III (a much improved part that used an on-die cache) and, at the same time, switched to a new production process. The changeover was fraught with difficulties and Intel CPUs were in global short supply for 12 months or more. This, coupled with the better performance of the Athlon, resulted in even many former Intel-only manufacturers ordering Athlon parts, and stretched AMD's manufacturing facilities to the limit. In consequence, AMD stopped making the K6-III in order to leave more room to manufacture Athlons (and K6-2s).\n\n=== K6-III+ and K6-2+ ===\nBy the time the x86 CPU shortage was over, AMD had developed and released revised members of the K6 family. These K6-2+ and K6-III+ variants were specifically designed as low-power mobile (laptop) CPUs, and significantly marked the transition of the K6 architecture (and foretold of AMD's future K7 project) to the new 180&nbsp;nm production process. Functionally, both parts were die shrunk K6-IIIs (the 2+ disabled 128&nbsp;KiB of cache, the III+ had the full 256 KiB) and introduced AMD's new [[PowerNow!]] power saving technology. PowerNow! offered processor power savings for mobile applications by measuring computational load, and reduced processor operational voltage and frequency during idle periods in order to reduce overall system power consumption.\n\nAlthough intended for notebook computers, both parts found an enthusiast following also in desktop systems as some motherboard companies (such as Gigabyte and FIC) provided [[BIOS#Reprogramming|BIOS]] updates for their desktop motherboards to allow usage of these processors. For other officially not supported mainboards, the enthusiast community created [[Unofficial patch|unofficial BIOS updates]] on their own.<ref>[http://wims.rainbow-software.org/index.php?count=250 M577 BIOS 03/06/1999 with K6-2+/III+ & HDD up to 128GB] by Ondrej Zary on rainbow-software.org</ref><ref>[http://www.ryston.cz/petr/bios/ Award BIOS Modifications] by Petr Soucek on ryston.cz</ref><ref>[http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/J.Steunebrink/k6plus.htm K6plus] by Jan Steunebrink on inter.nl.net</ref> These boards became firm favorites within the [[overclocking]] community. Both the K6-III+ and K6-2+ 450&nbsp;MHz CPUs were routinely overclocked to over 600&nbsp;MHz (112*5.5=616). Unfortunately, even with the 180&nbsp;nm process shrink, the K6 architecture's short 6-stage pipeline while efficient, was difficult to scale with regards to clock speed. K6 III+ and 2+ were never offered higher than 570&nbsp;MHz officially, and [[overclocking]] efforts using air cooling achieved a maximum around 800&nbsp;MHz (133x6) at best - however this constraint was also exacerbated by a lack of Socket 7 motherboards supporting stable speeds over 112&nbsp;MHz [[front-side bus|FSB]].\n\nAs AMD's marketing resources at the time were focused on the launch of the upcoming Athlon K7 processor line, the 180&nbsp;nm K6 series were relatively unknown outside of the industry.\n\n== Features  ==\n[[Template:AMD x86 CPU features|CPU features table]]\n\n== Models ==\n===K6-III (\"Sharptooth\", K6-3D+, 250 nm)===\n[[File:AMD K6 3.jpg|thumb|AMD K6-III 400&nbsp;MHz Microprocessor]]\n* CPU ID: AuthenticAMD Family 5 Model 9 \n* L1-Cache: 32 + 32 KiB (Data + Instructions)\n* L2-Cache: 256 KiB, full speed\n* [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], [[3DNow!]]\n* Socket 7, [[Super Socket 7|Super7]]\n* [[Front side bus]]: 66/100, 100&nbsp;MHz\n* VCore: 2.2 V, 2.4 V\n* First release: February 22, 1999\n* Manufacturing process: 0.25&nbsp;\u03bcm\n* Clockrate: 333, 400, 450&nbsp;MHz\n\n===K6-III-P (250 nm, mobile)===\n* CPU ID: AuthenticAMD Family 5 Model 9 \n* L1-Cache: 32 + 32 KiB (Data + Instructions)\n* L2-Cache: 256 KiB, full speed\n* [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], 3DNow!\n* Socket 7, Super7\n* [[Front side bus]]: 66, 95, 96.2, 66/100, 100&nbsp;MHz\n* VCore: 2.0 V, 2.2 V\n* First release: May 31, 1999\n* Manufacturing process: 0.25&nbsp;\u03bcm\n* Clockrate: 350, 366, 380, 400, 433, 450, 475&nbsp;MHz\n\n===K6-2+ (180 nm, mobile)===\n[[File:AMD K6 2 Plus.jpg|thumb|AMD K6-2+ 475&nbsp;MHz Microprocessor]]\n* CPU ID: AuthenticAMD Family 5 Model 13\n* L1-Cache: 32 + 32 KiB (Data + Instructions)\n* L2-Cache: 128 KiB, full speed\n* [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], Extended 3DNow!, [[PowerNow!]]\n* Super Socket 7\n* Front side bus: 95, 97, 100&nbsp;MHz\n* VCore: 2.0 V\n* First release: April 18, 2000\n* Manufacturing process: 0.18&nbsp;\u03bcm\n* Clockrate: 450, 475, 500, 533, 550&nbsp;MHz.

A modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as high-performance [[video card]]s and high core-count [[central processing unit]]s, that sacrifice power efficiency for raw performance. Gaming computers are often associated with [[enthusiast computing]] due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming computer is built to achieve performance for actual gameplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing.<ref>{{cite web |last=D. |first=Pablo |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO/ |title=GPU battle: 4670 vs. 9600GSO |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |publisher=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120224434/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines. In order to generate interest, gaming computer manufacturers that sell complete systems often produce boutique models, allowing them to compete on aesthetic design in addition to the hardware inside.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, gaming computers had several distinct hardware components that set them apart from a typical PC. The push for better graphics began with color fidelity, from display systems such as [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] eventually graduating to [[VGA]], which was adopted for the mass market. Gaming also led the push for the adoption of [[sound card]]s, a component that is now commonly integrated onto [[motherboard]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, several non-[[IBM PC compatible]] platforms gained a measure of popularity due to advanced graphics and sound capabilities, starting with the Atari 400/800 and the TI 99/4, and then continuing with others such as the [[Commodore 64]] and eventually the [[Amiga]]. [[Video game developer]]s of the time targeted these platforms for their games, though typically they would later port their games to the more common PC and Apple platforms as well. The [[MSX]] was also popular in Japan, where it preceded the [[video game console]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Most Popular Computers in History|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/10-most-popular-computers-in-history.htm#page=3|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> Japan also had several other popular gaming computers during the 1980s to early 1990s, including the very popular [[PC-88]] and [[PC-98]] as well as the powerful [[X68000]] and [[FM Towns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm |title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, PC-compatibles were the standard for gaming in the US.

Modern consumer-grade CPUs often have on-[[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] [[Integrated graphics|integrated GPUs]]; however, these GPUs typically do not provide the adequate performance for playing graphics-intensive games, and are instead aimed primarily for less demanding workloads such as [[graphical user interface]] rendering for \"everyday\" tasks, video playback, and [[Casual game|light gaming]].\n\n===Processors===\nA major component of a gaming computer is the processor, or [[Central processing unit|CPU (central processing unit)]]. There are two major brands that manufacture CPUs, [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-pc-gaming-cpus-processors/|title=The best PC gaming processor|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> As of 2019, most gaming computers are built with Intel's [[Ice Lake (microarchitecture)|Ice Lake]] or AMD's [[Zen 2|Ryzen 2]] CPUs.<ref name=\":1\" /> While a powerful CPU is important to avoid [[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]], after a certain level of CPU power, diminishing returns become evident if the PC is not being used for other, more CPU-intensive purposes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Motherboards===\n[[Motherboard]]s that are designed for gaming computers are differentiated from their normal counterparts by being created with case windows in mind; having more visually appealing designs, sturdier materials, and, in some models, built-in [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-motherboards/|title=The best gaming motherboards|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> They also have the capability to [[Overclocking|overclock]] certain models of CPUs, and an increased number of various connection ports.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Memory===\n[[Random-access memory]] (RAM) is one of the most important components for a gaming computer. Computers designed for playing games often are supplied with a high amount of RAM.\n\n==== DDR memory ====\n[[Double data rate|DDR]] (double data rate) [[Computer memory|memory]] is essential for any computer system. Adding more memory allows the CPU to address more data for it to quickly access instead of reading off a comparatively slow disk drive or [[solid-state storage device]]. [[DDR SDRAM]] also has much lower latency than its GDDR counterpart and much lower bandwidth as the CPU relies on being able to change small amounts of data quickly. The latest standard of DDR memory is DDR4L.\n\n==== GDDR memory ====\nGDDR (graphical double data rate) memory is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card and is built directly onto the card itself. The amount of RAM built onto a graphics card allows the GPU to quickly access data such as textures instead of reading from a much slower storage device. Having more GDDR memory allows the system to handle higher levels of [[spatial anti-aliasing]] and more complex textures. GDDR memory has a much higher latency when compared to DDR memory but also has a much larger bandwidth, thus allowing the GPU to deal with larger amounts of data at a slower rate when compared to a CPU. The latest revision of GDDR memory is GDDR6.\n\n==== High bandwidth memory (HBM) ====\n[[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM]] is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card, and is placed directly beside the GPU itself on the graphics card. This is different from standard GDDR as standard GDDR memory sits on the PCB of the graphics card. The main advantages of having the memory mounted so close to the GPU itself are as follows; reduced latency due to signals traveling a shorter distance, more bandwidth due to more space for data lanes, and decreased power consumption due to inherent differences to GDDR on the microscopic level. The latest revision of HBM is HBM2.\n\n===Solid-state drives===\n[[Solid-state drive]]s (SSD) are a newer form of data storage that is gaining in popularity. The more common and traditional [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs in favor of the advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. For an SSD, files open almost instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |title=SSD Drive vs Hard Drive |publisher=Gaming Laptop |access-date=2015-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222141728/http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |archive-date=2015-02-22 |df= }}</ref> This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santo |first=Joel |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404260,00.asp |title=Advantages/Disadvantages - SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference? |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order to load items from the game such as level files and texture images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |title=Computer memory articles for SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM from |publisher=Crucial.com |date= |access-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003057/http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-03 |df= }}</ref> However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost-effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.\n\n===Power supply units===\nAlthough occasionally overlooked, the power supply unit (PSU) is still an important component to consider. The wattage needed to run a system is dependent on the hardware, so often a PSU calculator is used to determine the wattage needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Power-Supply |title=How to Buy a Power Supply: 7 Steps (with Pictures) |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> In addition, future upgrades to a gaming rig will possibly require more power, and PSUs lose power as they age, so it is often a good idea to buy a PSU that has the capability of lasting through several years and upgrades. The PSU must also be compatible with the other hardware\npieces. PSU IS THE PMA OF THE BATEERY MY SPELLING WAS INCORRECT THIS INFORMATION IS DEFINETLY BAD TRY NOT TO REED.\n\nThere are two types of PSUs, modular PSUs (MPSU) and non-modular PSUs. Non-modular PSUs come with fixed cables, meaning unused ones will be left unconnected. Modular power supplies have cables that are detachable so unused cables do not create excess clutter but are often more expensive than their non-modular counterparts.<ref name=\"support.nzxt.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.nzxt.com/hc/en-us/articles/202798380-Full-Vs-Semi-Vs-Non-Modular-What-Are-The-Differences-|title=Full Vs Semi Vs Non Modular. What Are The Differences?|website=NZXT Support Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref> Both fulfill the same purpose, but often Modular PSUs are preferred because they allow for better cable management, as they remove the issue of unused cable clutter that non-modular PSUs often have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingupdate.com/articles/105/The-Modular-PSU-and-the-Modern-Gaming-Rig-A-Replaceme |title=The Modular PSU and the Modern Gaming Rig - A Replacement Tale |publisher=Gamingupdate.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Semi-modular power supplies come with only the necessary cables fixed, while cables that are not necessarily needed are able to be detached.<ref name=\"support.nzxt.com\"/>\n\n===Cooling systems===\nMany gamers and computer enthusiasts choose to overclock their CPU(s) and GPU(s) in order to gain extra performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, [[air cooling]] and [[water cooling]]. Air cooling,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Jeremy|title=Air Cooling Vs Liquid Cooling|url=http://gamesngearselite.com/air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling/|website=Games and Gears Elite|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with fans, heat pipes and/or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation. Watercooling is available as either a ready-to-use system (aio coolers) or as kits that need to be assembled and can be customized for expanding cooling capacity, cooling additional components or for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"CPU Cooling\">{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Chris|title=How do CPU coolers work?|url=http://www.techradar.com/au/news/computing-components/processors/how-do-cpu-coolers-work-721366|website=techradar|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Case===\nChoosing a computer case involves several considerations. For one, there is a large range of sizes. A larger gaming tower will allow for future upgrades and more movement. The case must also be compatible with the motherboard's form factor. Because games are oftentimes demanding on a system, one of the most important factors of choosing a case is cooling. In order to avoid the risk of overheating hardware, a computer case with good airflow and a quality fan will go a long way in ensuring proper cooling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/869-choosing-the-best-gaming-case |title=Picking the Best Gaming PC Case &#124; Gamers Nexus - Gaming PC Builds & Hardware Benchmarks |publisher=Gamers Nexus |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Other additional features such as fan speed controllers, filters for dust management, and clear side panels are all useful as well. Custom-building allows a builder to personalize their case if they so desire for aesthetic purposes. There are many designs for computer cases so the builder can choose to their liking.\n\n==Pre-built computers==\n[[File:Chillblast Fusion Tracer with green case lighting.jpg|thumb|An example of a pre-built gaming computer showing the case lighting used for the rig.]]\nWhile many \"advanced\" gamers build their gaming PCs themselves, some choose to go with pre-built or custom-built gaming PCs. These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service.\n\nDifferent companies offer varying degrees of customization. While established gaming computers such as [[Alienware]] offer unique case designs and little customization from the user prior to purchase, other smaller firms allow a greater degree of customization and better value-for-money, often to the same extent as if the user were to build the computer themselves.\n\nThere are, however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it is in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover the entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufacturers.\n\nDue to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufacturers, trying to get support can be a daunting task. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building a PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or maybe as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.<ref>[http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ Build Your Own PC]. PCMech. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref>\n\nOne major drawback of buying a prebuilt gaming PC aside from the extra cost is that they are often built with a very powerful CPU, but with a relatively weak graphics card. This results in a \"gaming\" PC that performs poorly in gaming for the price paid. Most games today do not benefit much from having a very powerful CPU with more than 4 [[Multi-core processor|CPU cores]] and hyper-threading,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVl8Eupbr_E CPU Cores for Gaming: How many do you need? - Q1 2015 Update]</ref> but benefits greatly with a more powerful graphics card.\n\n==Gaming laptop computers==\n\nGaming [[laptop]]s such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] are the mobile equivalent of gaming desktops and are usually more expensive than their desktop counterparts. Currently, most gaming laptops like [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] feature more power-efficient versions of high-end desktop [[Video card|graphics card]]s, which nevertheless still significantly drain the battery, and necessitate more advanced systems. One recent development by [[Nvidia]] is [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] for laptops. Generally, gaming laptops are not considered \"rigs\" as the term can also refer to the physical size of the system. Modern gaming laptops can achieve respectable game performance, but never quite match desktops in a class to class comparison, and most do not feature upgradeable graphics cards.\n\nDue to the relatively small size that the hardware has to fit in, cooling the heat-intensive components is a major problem affecting the performance of such laptops, usually causing degraded value for money performance-wise. Attempts at using the same performance hardware as desktops usually end in a decreased clock frequency of graphics chips to reduce heat, causing the poor value for money.\n\nOne can find many value recommendations across the [[World Wide Web]] on [[website]]s like ''[[TechRadar]]'' or ''[[Tom's Hardware]]''.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Nvidia]] GTX 900M series of mobile GPUs in late 2014 represented a significant advancement from the previous 800M series, lessening the gap with desktop systems and making gaming laptops a more viable alternative to desktop PCs.\n\nA newer approach in the gaming PC industry is to create [[small form factor]] desktops that are more compact and easier to transport than a normal full-sized system.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{Portal bar|Video games|Electronics}}\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game hardware]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=June 2017}}\n{{tone|date=June 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Gaming PC set up.jpg|thumb|350px|An example of a dedicated gaming-PC rig.]]\n{{Video Games}}\nA '''gaming computer''', also known as a '''gaming PC''' or '''gaming rig''', is a [[personal computer]] designed for playing [[video game]]s that require a high amount of [[computing]] power. A modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as high-performance [[video card]]s and high core-count [[central processing unit]]s, that sacrifice power efficiency for raw performance. Gaming computers are often associated with [[enthusiast computing]] due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming computer is built to achieve performance for actual gameplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing.<ref>{{cite web |last=D. |first=Pablo |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO/ |title=GPU battle: 4670 vs. 9600GSO |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |publisher=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120224434/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines. In order to generate interest, gaming computer manufacturers that sell complete systems often produce boutique models, allowing them to compete on aesthetic design in addition to the hardware inside.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, gaming computers had several distinct hardware components that set them apart from a typical PC. The push for better graphics began with color fidelity, from display systems such as [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] eventually graduating to [[VGA]], which was adopted for the mass market. Gaming also led the push for the adoption of [[sound card]]s, a component that is now commonly integrated onto [[motherboard]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, several non-[[IBM PC compatible]] platforms gained a measure of popularity due to advanced graphics and sound capabilities, starting with the Atari 400/800 and the TI 99/4, and then continuing with others such as the [[Commodore 64]] and eventually the [[Amiga]]. [[Video game developer]]s of the time targeted these platforms for their games, though typically they would later port their games to the more common PC and Apple platforms as well. The [[MSX]] was also popular in Japan, where it preceded the [[video game console]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Most Popular Computers in History|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/10-most-popular-computers-in-history.htm#page=3|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> Japan also had several other popular gaming computers during the 1980s to early 1990s, including the very popular [[PC-88]] and [[PC-98]] as well as the powerful [[X68000]] and [[FM Towns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm |title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, PC-compatibles were the standard for gaming in the US.

The main advantages of having the memory mounted so close to the GPU itself are as follows; reduced latency due to signals traveling a shorter distance, more bandwidth due to more space for data lanes, and decreased power consumption due to inherent differences to GDDR on the microscopic level. The latest revision of HBM is HBM2.\n\n===Solid-state drives===\n[[Solid-state drive]]s (SSD) are a newer form of data storage that is gaining in popularity. The more common and traditional [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs in favor of the advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. For an SSD, files open almost instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |title=SSD Drive vs Hard Drive |publisher=Gaming Laptop |access-date=2015-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222141728/http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |archive-date=2015-02-22 |df= }}</ref> This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santo |first=Joel |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404260,00.asp |title=Advantages/Disadvantages - SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference? |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order to load items from the game such as level files and texture images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |title=Computer memory articles for SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM from |publisher=Crucial.com |date= |access-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003057/http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-03 |df= }}</ref> However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost-effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.\n\n===Power supply units===\nAlthough occasionally overlooked, the power supply unit (PSU) is still an important component to consider. The wattage needed to run a system is dependent on the hardware, so often a PSU calculator is used to determine the wattage needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Power-Supply |title=How to Buy a Power Supply: 7 Steps (with Pictures) |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> In addition, future upgrades to a gaming rig will possibly require more power, and PSUs lose power as they age, so it is often a good idea to buy a PSU that has the capability of lasting through several years and upgrades. The PSU must also be compatible with the other hardware\npieces.\n\nThere are two types of PSUs, modular PSUs (MPSU) and non-modular PSUs. Non-modular PSUs come with fixed cables, meaning unused ones will be left unconnected. Modular power supplies have cables that are detachable so unused cables do not create excess clutter but are often more expensive than their non-modular counterparts.<ref name=\"support.nzxt.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.nzxt.com/hc/en-us/articles/202798380-Full-Vs-Semi-Vs-Non-Modular-What-Are-The-Differences-|title=Full Vs Semi Vs Non Modular. What Are The Differences?|website=NZXT Support Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref> Both fulfill the same purpose, but often Modular PSUs are preferred because they allow for better cable management, as they remove the issue of unused cable clutter that non-modular PSUs often have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingupdate.com/articles/105/The-Modular-PSU-and-the-Modern-Gaming-Rig-A-Replaceme |title=The Modular PSU and the Modern Gaming Rig - A Replacement Tale |publisher=Gamingupdate.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Semi-modular power supplies come with only the necessary cables fixed, while cables that are not necessarily needed are able to be detached.<ref name=\"support.nzxt.com\"/>\n\n===Cooling systems===\nMany gamers and computer enthusiasts choose to overclock their CPU(s) and GPU(s) in order to gain extra performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, [[air cooling]] and [[water cooling]]. Air cooling,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Jeremy|title=Air Cooling Vs Liquid Cooling|url=http://gamesngearselite.com/air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling/|website=Games and Gears Elite|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with fans, heat pipes and/or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation. Watercooling is available as either a ready-to-use system (aio coolers) or as kits that need to be assembled and can be customized for expanding cooling capacity, cooling additional components or for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"CPU Cooling\">{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Chris|title=How do CPU coolers work?|url=http://www.techradar.com/au/news/computing-components/processors/how-do-cpu-coolers-work-721366|website=techradar|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Case===\nChoosing a computer case involves several considerations. For one, there is a large range of sizes. A larger gaming tower will allow for future upgrades and more movement. The case must also be compatible with the motherboard's form factor. Because games are oftentimes demanding on a system, one of the most important factors of choosing a case is cooling. In order to avoid the risk of overheating hardware, a computer case with good airflow and a quality fan will go a long way in ensuring proper cooling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/869-choosing-the-best-gaming-case |title=Picking the Best Gaming PC Case &#124; Gamers Nexus - Gaming PC Builds & Hardware Benchmarks |publisher=Gamers Nexus |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Other additional features such as fan speed controllers, filters for dust management, and clear side panels are all useful as well. Custom-building allows a builder to personalize their case if they so desire for aesthetic purposes. There are many designs for computer cases so the builder can choose to their liking.\n\n==Pre-built computers==\n[[File:Chillblast Fusion Tracer with green case lighting.jpg|thumb|An example of a pre-built gaming computer showing the case lighting used for the rig.]]\nWhile many \"advanced\" gamers build their gaming PCs themselves, some choose to go with pre-built or custom-built gaming PCs. These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service.\n\nDifferent companies offer varying degrees of customization. While established gaming computers such as [[Alienware]] offer unique case designs and little customization from the user prior to purchase, other smaller firms allow a greater degree of customization and better value-for-money, often to the same extent as if the user were to build the computer themselves.\n\nThere are, however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it is in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover the entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufacturers.\n\nDue to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufacturers, trying to get support can be a daunting task. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building a PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or maybe as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.<ref>[http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ Build Your Own PC]. PCMech. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref>\n\nOne major drawback of buying a prebuilt gaming PC aside from the extra cost is that they are often built with a very powerful CPU, but with a relatively weak graphics card. This results in a \"gaming\" PC that performs poorly in gaming for the price paid. Most games today do not benefit much from having a very powerful CPU with more than 4 [[Multi-core processor|CPU cores]] and hyper-threading,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVl8Eupbr_E CPU Cores for Gaming: How many do you need? - Q1 2015 Update]</ref> but benefits greatly with a more powerful graphics card.\n\n==Gaming laptop computers==\n\nGaming [[laptop]]s such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] are the mobile equivalent of gaming desktops and are usually more expensive than their desktop counterparts. Currently, most gaming laptops like [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] feature more power-efficient versions of high-end desktop [[Video card|graphics card]]s, which nevertheless still significantly drain the battery, and necessitate more advanced systems. One recent development by [[Nvidia]] is [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] for laptops. Generally, gaming laptops are not considered \"rigs\" as the term can also refer to the physical size of the system. Modern gaming laptops can achieve respectable game performance, but never quite match desktops in a class to class comparison, and most do not feature upgradeable graphics cards.\n\nDue to the relatively small size that the hardware has to fit in, cooling the heat-intensive components is a major problem affecting the performance of such laptops, usually causing degraded value for money performance-wise. Attempts at using the same performance hardware as desktops usually end in a decreased clock frequency of graphics chips to reduce heat, causing the poor value for money.\n\nOne can find many value recommendations across the [[World Wide Web]] on [[website]]s like ''[[TechRadar]]'' or ''[[Tom's Hardware]]''.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Nvidia]] GTX 900M series of mobile GPUs in late 2014 represented a significant advancement from the previous 800M series, lessening the gap with desktop systems and making gaming laptops a more viable alternative to desktop PCs.\n\nA newer approach in the gaming PC industry is to create [[small form factor]] desktops that are more compact and easier to transport than a normal full-sized system.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{Portal bar|Video games|Electronics}}\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game hardware]]\n", "name_user": "FactualNumber717171", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(I AM SORRY DON'T BAN ME SUPER BOARD WON'T HAPPEN  AGAIN.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer"}

By universal property of [[categorical quotient]]s, these affine quotients glue and result in\n:<math>\\pi\\colon X^{ss} \\to X /\\!/_L G</math>,\nwhich is the GIT quotient of ''X'' with respect to ''L''. Note that if ''X'' is projective; i.e., it is the Proj of ''R'', then the quotient <math>X /\\!/_L G</math> is given simply as the Proj of the [[ring of invariants]] <math>R^G</math>.\n\nThe most interesting case is when the stable locus<ref>NB: In {{harv|MFK}}, it was called the set of properly stable points</ref> <math>X^s</math> is nonempty; <math>X^s</math> is the open set of semistable points that have finite stabilizers and orbits that are closed in <math>X^{ss}</math>.

Because of this, when <math>X^s</math> is nonempty, the GIT quotient <math>\\pi</math> is often referred to as a \"compactification\" of a geometric quotient of an open subset of ''X''.\n\nA difficult and seemingly open question is: which geometric quotient arises in the above GIT fashion? The question is of a great interest since the GIT approach produces an ''explicit'' quotient, as opposed to an abstract quotient, which is hard to compute. One known partial answer to this question is the following:<ref>{{harvnb|MFK|loc=Converse 1.13. NB: even though the result is stated for a smooth variety, the proof there is valid for a locally factorial one.}}</ref> let <math>X</math> be a [[locally factorial scheme|locally factorial]] algebraic variety (for example, a smooth variety) with an action of <math>G</math>.

Then <math>U \\subset X^s(L)</math> for some linearlized line bundle ''L'' on ''X''. (An analogous question is to determine which subring is the ring of invariants in some manner.)\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Finite group action by <math>\\Z/2</math> ===\nA simple example of a GIT quotient is given by the <math>\\Z/2</math>-action on <math>\\C[x,y]</math> sending\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx \\mapsto -x && y \\mapsto -y\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNotice that the monomials <math>x^2,xy,y^2</math> generate the ring <math>\\C[x,y]^{\\Z/2}</math>. Hence we can write the ring of invariants as\n\n:<math>\\C[x,y]^{\\Z/2} = \\C[x^2,xy,y^2] = \\frac{\\C[a,b,c]}{(ac - b^2)}</math>\n\nScheme theoretically, we get the morphism\n:<math>\\mathbb{A}^2 \\to \\text{Spec}\\left(\\frac{\\C[a,b,c]}{(ac - b^2)}\\right) = \\mathbb{A}^2/(\\Z/2)</math>\n\nwhich is a singular subvariety with isolated singularity at <math>(0,0,0)</math>. This can be checked using the differentials, which are<blockquote><math>df = \\begin{bmatrix}\nc & -2b & a\n\\end{bmatrix}</math></blockquote>hence the only point where the differential and the polynomial <math>f</math> both vanish is at the origin.\n\n=== Torus action on plane ===\nConsider the torus action of <math>\\mathbb{G}_m</math> on <math>X = \\mathbb{A}^2</math> by <math>t\\cdot (x,y) = (tx,t^{-1}y)</math>. Note this action has a few orbits: the origin <math>(0,0)</math>, the punctured axes, <math>\\{(x,0) : x \\neq 0\\}, \\{(0,y) : y \\neq 0\\}</math>, and the affine conics given by <math>xy = a</math> for some <math>a \\in \\C^*</math>. Then, the GIT quotient <math>X//\\mathbb{G}_m</math> has structure sheaf <math>\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbb{A}^2)^{\\mathbb{G}_m}</math> which is the subring of polynomials <math>\\mathbb{C}[xy]</math>, hence it is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{A}^1</math>. This gives the GIT quotient<blockquote><math>\\pi\\colon \\mathbb{A}^2 \\to \\mathbb{A}^2//\\mathbb{G}_m</math></blockquote>Notice the inverse image of the point <math>(0)</math> is given by the orbits <math>(0,0), \\{(x,0) : x \\neq 0\\}, \\{(0,y) : y \\neq 0 \\}</math>, showing the GIT quotient isn't necessarily an orbit space.

Note this action has a few orbits: the origin <math>(0,0)</math>, the punctured axes, <math>\\{(x,0) : x \\neq 0\\}, \\{(0,y) : y \\neq 0\\}</math>, and the affine conics given by <math>xy = a</math> for some <math>a \\in \\C^*</math>. Then, the GIT quotient <math>X//\\mathbb{G}_m</math> has structure sheaf <math>\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbb{A}^2)^{\\mathbb{G}_m}</math> which is the subring of polynomials <math>\\mathbb{C}[xy]</math>, hence it is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{A}^1</math>. This gives the GIT quotient<blockquote><math>\\pi\\colon \\mathbb{A}^2 \\to \\mathbb{A}^2//\\mathbb{G}_m</math></blockquote>Notice the inverse image of the point <math>(0)</math> is given by the orbits <math>(0,0), \\{(x,0) : x \\neq 0\\}, \\{(0,y) : y \\neq 0 \\}</math>, showing the GIT quotient isn't necessarily an orbit space. If it were, there would be three origins, a non-separated space.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Thomas | first=Richard P. |authorlink=Richard Thomas (mathematician) |title=Notes on GIT and symplectic reduction for bundles and varieties | journal=Surveys in Differential Geometry | publisher=International Press of Boston | volume=10 | issue=1 | year=2006 | issn=1052-9233 | doi=10.4310/sdg.2005.v10.n1.a7 | pages=221\u2013273|arxiv=math/0512411|mr=2408226}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[quotient stack]]\n*[[character variety]]\n*[[Chow quotient]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Pedagogical ===\n*{{cite book\n| last        = Mukai\n| first       = Shigeru\n| authorlink = Shigeru Mukai\n| year        = 2002\n| title       = An introduction to invariants and moduli\n| series      = Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics\n| volume      = 81\n| isbn        = 978-0-521-80906-1\n| url         = http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521809061\n}}\n*{{cite web|first=Michel |last=Brion|title=Introduction to actions of algebraic groups|url=http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~mbrion/notes_luminy.pdf}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Thomas |first=Richard P. |authorlink=Richard Thomas (mathematician)| arxiv=math/0512411 |contribution=Notes on GIT and symplectic reduction for bundles and varieties |series=Surveys in Differential Geometry|title= A Tribute to Professor S.-S.

Father of the international Scouting movement, Honorary President of the Roosevelt Council (Arizona) [[Boy Scouts of America]]\n}}\n\n'''Frederick Russell Burnham''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (May 11, 1861 \u2013 September 1, 1947) was an American [[frontiersman|scout]] and world-traveling adventurer.  He is known for his service to the [[British South Africa Company]] and to the [[British Army]] in [[colonial Africa]], and for teaching [[Scoutcraft|woodcraft]]<!-- Do not change link to \"Woodcraft\". --> to [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] in [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]]. He helped inspire the founding of the international [[Scouting|Scouting Movement]].\n\nBurnham was born on a [[Dakota people|Dakota Sioux]] [[Indian reservation]] in Minnesota where he learned the ways of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] as a boy. By the age of 14, he was supporting himself in California,  while also learning scouting from some of the last of the cowboys and frontiersmen of the [[American Southwest]]. Burnham had little formal education, never finishing high school. After moving to the [[Arizona Territory]] in the early 1880s, he was drawn into the [[Pleasant Valley War]], a feud between families of ranchers and sheepherders. He escaped and later worked as a civilian tracker for the [[United States Army]] in the [[Apache Wars]]. Feeling the need for new adventures, Burnham took his family to southern Africa in 1893, seeing [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[Cape to Cairo Railway]] project as the next undeveloped frontier.\n\nBurnham distinguished himself in several battles in Rhodesia and South Africa and became Chief of Scouts. Despite his U.S. citizenship, his military title was British and his rank of major was formally given to him by King [[Edward VII]]. In special recognition of Burnham's heroism, the King invested him into the Companions of the [[Distinguished Service Order]], giving Burnham the highest military honors earned by any American in the [[Second Boer War]]. He had become friends with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] during the [[Second Matabele War]] in Rhodesia, teaching him outdoor skills and inspiring what would later become known as Scouting. Burnham returned to the United States, where he became involved in national defense efforts, business, oil, conservation, and the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).\n\nDuring World War I, Burnham was selected as an officer and recruited volunteers for a U.S. Army division similar to the [[Rough Riders]], which [[Theodore Roosevelt]] intended to lead into France. For political reasons, the unit was disbanded without seeing action.  After the war, Burnham and his business partner [[John Hays Hammond]] formed the Burnham Exploration Company; they became wealthy from oil discovered in California.  Burnham joined several new wilderness conservation organizations, including the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation|California State Parks Commission]]. In the 1930s, he worked with the [[Boy Scouts of America|BSA]] to save the [[big horn sheep]] from extinction.  This effort led to the creation of the [[Kofa National Wildlife Refuge|Kofa]] and [[Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge|Cabeza Prieta]] National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. He earned the BSA's highest honor, the [[Silver Buffalo Award]], in 1936, and remained active in the organization at both the regional and national level until his death in 1947. To symbolise the friendship between Burnham and Baden-Powell, the mountain beside [[Mount Baden-Powell]] in California was formally named [[Mount Burnham]] in 1951.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Burnham skagway alaska 1899.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Burnham in [[Arizona Territory]] in 1881|alt=Burnham portrait photograph taken in Arizona Territory in 1881]]\n\nBurnham was born on May 11, 1861, on a [[Dakota people|Dakota Sioux]] [[Indian reservation]] in [[Minnesota]], to a [[missionary]] family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) from [[Mankato]].{{sfn|Burnham|1926|p=1\u20132}} His father, the Reverend [[Edwin Otway Burnham]], was a [[Presbyterian]] minister educated and ordained in [[New York (state)|New York]]; he was born in [[Ghent, Kentucky]].{{sfn|McClintock|1885|p=692}}{{sfn|Burnham|n.d|p=6}}{{refn|group=n|name=ministry|According to McClintock and other sources, Burnham's father was a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister;{{sfn|McClintock|1885|p=692}}{{sfn|Hamilton College|1874|p=53}}{{sfn|New York Evangelist|1855|p=58}} Burnham latterly wrote of his father as a \"Presbyterian preacher\".{{sfn|Burnham|n.d|p=6}} In Edwin Burnham's time, Presbyterians and Congregationalists cooperated in establishing many new congregations in the [[Midwestern United States]]. \"Presbygationalists\", as these congregations were sometimes known, were allowed to choose either a Presbyterian or a Congregational pastor.{{sfn|Smylie|1996|p=72}}}} His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in [[Iowa]], having emigrated with her family from [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], England at the age of three.{{sfn|Burnham|1926|p=1}}{{sfn|Russell|1941|pp=1\u20138}} In the [[Dakota War of 1862]], Chief [[Little Crow]] and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town [[New Ulm, Minnesota]]; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.{{sfn|Davis|1906|p=197}}{{sfn|Burnham|1926|p=1\u20132}}\n\nThe young Burnham attended schools in Iowa. There he met Blanche Blick, whom he later married. {{sfn|Burnham|n.d|p=18}} The Burnham family moved from Minnesota to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1870, in search of easier living conditions soon after Edwin was seriously injured in an accident while rebuilding the family homestead. Two years later, Edwin died, leaving the family destitute. Burnham's mother and 3-year-old younger brother Howard returned to Iowa to live with her parents; the 12-year-old Burnham remained in California alone to repay his family's debts and ultimately make his own way.{{sfn|International News Service|1915|p=241}}{{sfn|Burnham|1926|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nFor the next few years, Burnham worked as a mounted messenger for the [[Western Union Telegraph Company]] in California and [[Arizona Territory]].{{sfn|Burnham|1926|p=6}} On one occasion his horse was stolen from him by [[Tiburcio V\u00e1squez]], a famous [[Californio]] bandit.{{sfn|Carr|1931|p=K10}} At 14, he began his life as a scout and Indian tracker in the [[Apache Wars]], during which he took part in the [[United States Army]] expedition to find and capture or kill the [[Apache]] chief [[Geronimo]].{{sfn|Bradford|1993|p=xi}}{{sfn|West|1932|p=117}} In [[Prescott, Arizona]], he met an old scout named Lee who served under General [[George Crook]].{{sfn|Burnham|1926|p=13}} Lee taught Burnham how to track Apache by detecting the odor of burning mescal, a species of aloe they often cooked and ate. With careful study of the local air currents and canyons, trackers could follow the odor to Apache hiding places from as far away as 6 miles (9.7&nbsp;km). During the Apache uprisings, the young Burnham also learned much from [[Al Sieber]], the Chief of Scouts, and his assistant [[Archie McIntosh]], who had been Chief of Scouts in Crook's last two campaigns.{{sfn|West|1932|p=98}} Burnham learned much about scouting from these Indian trackers, who were advanced in age and fading from the frontier, including the vital lesson that \"it is imperative that a scout should know the history, tradition, religion, social customs, and superstitions of whatever country or people he is called on to work in or among.\"{{sfn|Burnham|1926|p=15}} But the scout who was to have perhaps the greatest influence on Burnham during his formative years was a man named Holmes.{{sfn|Bradford|1993|p=xi}}\n\n[[File:Burnham sidearm.jpg|upright|thumb|The six-shooter Burnham purchased as a teenager in [[Prescott, Arizona]], which he kept all his life and later used in Rhodesia, East Africa and Mexico|alt=Caption reads: Burnham's sidearm in the Tonto Basin, the Geronimo Campaign, Rhodesia, East Africa, and Mexico was this Remington Model 1875, serial no. 11, in .44-40 caliber. Holster and Rhodesian bandoleer are original; the .44-40 cartridge box bears the stamp of the Rhodesian government. Pistol grips are hippo ivory.]]\nHolmes had served under [[Kit Carson]] and [[John C.

Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way.

Contemporary scouts such as [[Buffalo Bill]], [[Wild Bill Hickok]], and [[Texas Jack Omohundro]], were leaving the old West to become entertainers, and they battled great Native American chiefs like [[Sitting Bull]], [[Chief Joseph]], and Geronimo only in [[Wild West shows]].

While on the outskirts of town they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the company troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the [[Shangani Patrol]], led by Major [[Allan Wilson (Major)|Allan Wilson]] and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham.{{sfn|Donovan|1894|p=271}}\n\n====Shangani Patrol====\n{{details|Shangani Patrol}}\n[[File:Shangani patrol burnham 1893.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1895 sketch, portraying a scene from the [[Shangani Patrol]] episode.

The column camped on the south bank of the [[Shangani River]] about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north-east of the village of Lupane on the evening of December 3, 1893. The next day, late in the afternoon, a dozen men under the command of Major Wilson were sent across the river to patrol the area. The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula's whereabouts. Burnham, who served as the lead scout of the Wilson Patrol, sensed a trap and advised Wilson to withdraw, but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance.{{sfn|Forbes|Griffiths|Henry|Knight|1896|pp=110\u2013119}}\n\nSoon afterwards, the patrol found the king and Wilson sent a message back to the [[laager]] requesting reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, under the command of Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl \"Pete\" Ingram (a [[Montana]] cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, \"I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party.\"{{sfn|Hensman|1900|p=105}} Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.{{sfn|Forbes|Griffiths|Henry|Knight|1896|pp=110\u2013119}}{{sfn|Hensman|1900|pp=105\u20138}}\n\nColonial-era histories called this the Shangani Patrol, and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes.{{sfn|Wills|Collingridge|1894|p=153\u2013172}} Their last stand together became a kind of [[national myth]], as Lewis Gann writes, \"a glorious memory, [Rhodesia's] own equivalent of the bloody [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo massacre]] and [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Custer's Last Stand]] in the [[American Old West|American West]]\".{{sfn|Gann|1965|p=118}} The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly ''inDuna'' Mjaan), and the men of Forbes' column.{{sfn|Forbes|Griffiths|Henry|Knight|1896|p=110}}{{sfn|Hensman|1900|pp=49\u201351}}{{sfn|Burnham|1895|}}{{sfn|Du Toit|1897}}{{sfn|Gooding|1894}} While all of the [[direct evidence]] given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply [[desertion|deserted]] when the battle got rough.{{sfn|O'Reilly|1970|pp=76\u201379}} The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after the event in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan to a friend, John Carruthers, that \"a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him\" that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord.{{sfn|O'Reilly|1970|p=77}} This [[hearsay|double hearsay]] confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded.{{sfn|Lloyd's|1899|p=9}} Several well-known writers have used the Coghlan letter, as shaky as it is, as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise the historical record.{{sfn|Lott|1976|pp=43\u201347}}\n\nAll of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column had high praise for Burnham's actions, and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later.{{sfn|Kemper|2016|p=376}} One member of the column, Trooper M&nbsp;E Weale, told the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'' in 1944 that once Commandant Piet Raaff took over command from the disgraced Major Forbes it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: \"I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion.\"{{sfn|Kemper|2016|p=376}} For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the [[British South Africa Company Medal]], a gold watch, and a share of a 300-acre (120&nbsp;ha) tract of land in Matabeleland.

[[Mlimo]], the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]] into the [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal), and in the first few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], and [[Frederick Selous]]. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the [[Matobo Hills|Matopos Hills]] near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols.{{sfn|Selous|1896|pp=220\u201322}} It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and the code of honor for the [[Boy Scouts]].{{sfn|West|1935|p=146}}{{sfn|West|1932|p=137}}\n\n====Assassination of Mlimo====\n[[File:Burnham & Bonar Armstrong after the assassination of Mlimo.jpg|thumb|upright|Burnham and Armstrong ride for Bulawayo after killing Mlimo, pursued by Matabele warriors.|alt=Drawing of Burnham and Bonar Armstrong soon after the shooting of the Mlimo priest in the Matopos Hills.

It was directly caused by each side's desire to control the lucrative [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|Witwatersrand gold mines]] in the Transvaal.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979||pp=493\u2013495}} Field Marshal [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]], one of the [[British Army]]'s most successful commanders of the 19th century, was appointed to take overall command of British forces, relieving General [[Redvers Buller]], following a number of Boer successes in the early weeks of the war,{{sfn|London Gazette|1899|p=8541}} including the [[Siege of Mafeking]], in which Baden-Powell, his small regiment of men, and the townspeople had been besieged by thousands of Boer troops since the conflict began. Roberts asked General [[Frederick Carrington]], who had commanded the British forces in Matabeleland three years earlier, whom he should appoint as his Chief of Scouts in South Africa. Carrington had selected Burnham for this role and advised Roberts to do the same, describing Burnham as \"the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa.\"{{sfn|Lott|1981|p=90}}\n\nRoberts sent for Burnham soon after arriving in South Africa on the [[RMS Dunottar Castle|RMS ''Dunottar Castle'']].

If you accept, come at once the quickest way possible.\" [[Cape Town]] is at the opposite end of the globe from the Klondike, so Burnham left immediately departing on the very same boat that had brought him the telegram. In an unusual step for a foreigner, Burnham received a command post from Roberts and the British Army rank of captain. Burnham reached the front just before the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] (February 1900). During the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was captured twice (escaping both times),{{sfn|Farwell|1976|}} and also temporarily disabled at one point by near-fatal wounds.{{sfn|Burnham|1926|pp=343\u20138}}\n\nBurnham was first captured during the fighting at [[Sanna's Post]] in the Orange Free State.{{sfn|Unger|1901|p=222}} He gave himself up in order to obtain information on the enemy, which he did, and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching British occupied [[Bloemfontein]] safely after two days and nights on the run.{{sfn|Unger|1901|pp=224\u2013225}}  The second time he was captured was while trying to warn a British column approaching [[Thaba Nchu|Thaba' Nchu]].{{sfn|Atlanta Constitution|1900|p=9}} He came upon a group of Boers hiding on the banks of the river, toward which the British were even then advancing. Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush, while Burnham was at once taken prisoner. In the fight that followed, Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee, limping heavily and groaning with pain. He was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheels of the wagon, lowered himself, and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road. In an instant, the wagon had passed over him safely, and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open ''[[veld]]''.

He was on a mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and supplies to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the [[Pretoria]]-[[Delagoa Bay]] railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept on his hands and knees to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him.

Father of the international Scouting movement, Honorary President of the Roosevelt Council (Arizona) [[Boy Scouts of America]]\n}}\n\n'''Frederick Russell Burnham''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (May 11, 1861 \u2013 September 1, 1947) was an American [[frontiersman|scout]] and world-traveling adventurer.  He is known for his service to the [[British South Africa Company]] and to the [[British Army]] in [[colonial Africa]], and for teaching [[Scoutcraft|woodcraft]]<!-- Do not change link to \"Woodcraft\". --> to [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] in [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]]. He helped inspire the founding of the international [[Scouting|Scouting Movement]].\n\nBurnham was born on a [[Dakota people|Dakota Sioux]] [[Indian reservation]] in Minnesota where he learned the ways of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] as a boy. By the age of 14, he was supporting himself in California,  while also learning scouting from some of the last of the cowboys and frontiersmen of the [[American Southwest]]. Burnham had little formal education, never finishing high school. After moving to the [[Arizona Territory]] in the early 1880s, he was drawn into the [[Pleasant Valley War]], a feud between families of ranchers and sheepherders. He escaped and later worked as a civilian tracker for the [[United States Army]] in the [[Apache Wars]]. Feeling the need for new adventures, Burnham took his family to southern Africa in 1893, seeing [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[Cape to Cairo Railway]] project as the next undeveloped frontier.\n\nBurnham distinguished himself in several battles in Rhodesia and South Africa and became Chief of Scouts. Despite his U.S. citizenship, his military title was British and his rank of major was formally given to him by King [[Edward VII]]. In special recognition of Burnham's heroism, the King invested him into the Companions of the [[Distinguished Service Order]], giving Burnham the highest military honors earned by any American in the [[Second Boer War]]. He had become friends with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] during the [[Second Matabele War]] in Rhodesia, teaching him outdoor skills and inspiring what would later become known as Scouting. Burnham returned to the United States, where he became involved in national defense efforts, business, oil, conservation, and the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).\n\nDuring World War I, Burnham was selected as an officer and recruited volunteers for a U.S. Army division similar to the [[Rough Riders]], which [[Theodore Roosevelt]] intended to lead into France. For political reasons, the unit was disbanded without seeing action.  After the war, Burnham and his business partner [[John Hays Hammond]] formed the Burnham Exploration Company; they became wealthy from oil discovered in California.  Burnham joined several new wilderness conservation organizations, including the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation|California State Parks Commission]]. In the 1930s, he worked with the [[Boy Scouts of America|BSA]] to save the [[big horn sheep]] from extinction.

The two men traveled throughout the [[American Southwest]] and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting.{{sfn|Bradford|1993|p=xi}} Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.{{sfn|West|1932|p=96}}\n\nIn [[Globe, Arizona]], Burnham unwittingly joined the losing side of the [[Pleasant Valley War]] before mass killing started, and only narrowly escaped death.{{sfn|Lott|1981|pp=82\u20137}} He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family.{{sfn|Money|1962|p=331\u20132}}{{refn|group=n|name=globe|According to Lott, Burnham was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Fred Wells and his family;{{sfn|Lott|1981|pp=80\u20131}} Money states that it was the Gordon Family.{{sfn|Money|1962|p=331\u20136}} In his memoirs, ''Scouting on Two Continents,'' Burnham never gives the name of the family,{{sfn|Burnham|1926|loc=Chapter III.

Contemporary scouts such as [[Buffalo Bill]], [[Wild Bill Hickok]], and [[Texas Jack Omohundro]], were leaving the old West to become entertainers, and they battled great Native American chiefs like [[Sitting Bull]], [[Chief Joseph]], and Geronimo only in [[Wild West shows]].

While on the outskirts of town they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the company troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the [[Shangani Patrol]], led by Major [[Allan Wilson (Major)|Allan Wilson]] and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham.{{sfn|Donovan|1894|p=271}}\n\n====Shangani Patrol====\n{{details|Shangani Patrol}}\n[[File:Shangani patrol burnham 1893.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1895 sketch, portraying a scene from the [[Shangani Patrol]] episode.

The column camped on the south bank of the [[Shangani River]] about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north-east of the village of Lupane on the evening of December 3, 1893. The next day, late in the afternoon, a dozen men under the command of Major Wilson were sent across the river to patrol the area. The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula's whereabouts. Burnham, who served as the lead scout of the Wilson Patrol, sensed a trap and advised Wilson to withdraw, but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance.{{sfn|Forbes|Griffiths|Henry|Knight|1896|pp=110\u2013119}}\n\nSoon afterwards, the patrol found the king and Wilson sent a message back to the [[laager]] requesting reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, under the command of Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl \"Pete\" Ingram (a [[Montana]] cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, \"I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party.\"{{sfn|Hensman|1900|p=105}} Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.{{sfn|Forbes|Griffiths|Henry|Knight|1896|pp=110\u2013119}}{{sfn|Hensman|1900|pp=105\u20138}}\n\nColonial-era histories called this the Shangani Patrol, and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes.{{sfn|Wills|Collingridge|1894|p=153\u2013172}} Their last stand together became a kind of [[national myth]], as Lewis Gann writes, \"a glorious memory, [Rhodesia's] own equivalent of the bloody [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo massacre]] and [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Custer's Last Stand]] in the [[American Old West|American West]]\".{{sfn|Gann|1965|p=118}} The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly ''inDuna'' Mjaan), and the men of Forbes' column.{{sfn|Forbes|Griffiths|Henry|Knight|1896|p=110}}{{sfn|Hensman|1900|pp=49\u201351}}{{sfn|Burnham|1895|}}{{sfn|Du Toit|1897}}{{sfn|Gooding|1894}} While all of the [[direct evidence]] given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply [[desertion|deserted]] when the battle got rough.{{sfn|O'Reilly|1970|pp=76\u201379}} The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after the event in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan to a friend, John Carruthers, that \"a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him\" that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord.{{sfn|O'Reilly|1970|p=77}} This [[hearsay|double hearsay]] confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded.{{sfn|Lloyd's|1899|p=9}} Several well-known writers have used the Coghlan letter, as shaky as it is, as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise the historical record.{{sfn|Lott|1976|pp=43\u201347}}\n\nAll of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column had high praise for Burnham's actions, and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later.{{sfn|Kemper|2016|p=376}} One member of the column, Trooper M&nbsp;E Weale, told the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'' in 1944 that once Commandant Piet Raaff took over command from the disgraced Major Forbes it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: \"I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion.\"{{sfn|Kemper|2016|p=376}} For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the [[British South Africa Company Medal]], a gold watch, and a share of a 300-acre (120&nbsp;ha) tract of land in Matabeleland.

[[Mlimo]], the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]] into the [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal), and in the first few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], and [[Frederick Selous]]. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the [[Matobo Hills|Matopos Hills]] near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols.{{sfn|Selous|1896|pp=220\u201322}} It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and the code of honor for the [[Boy Scouts]].{{sfn|West|1935|p=146}}{{sfn|West|1932|p=137}}\n\n====Assassination of Mlimo====\n[[File:Burnham & Bonar Armstrong after the assassination of Mlimo.jpg|thumb|upright|Burnham and Armstrong ride for Bulawayo after killing Mlimo, pursued by Matabele warriors.|alt=Drawing of Burnham and Bonar Armstrong soon after the shooting of the Mlimo priest in the Matopos Hills.

If you accept, come at once the quickest way possible.\" [[Cape Town]] is at the opposite end of the globe from the Klondike, so Burnham left immediately departing on the very same boat that had brought him the telegram. In an unusual step for a foreigner, Burnham received a command post from Roberts and the British Army rank of captain. Burnham reached the front just before the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] (February 1900). During the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was captured twice (escaping both times),{{sfn|Farwell|1976|}} and also temporarily disabled at one point by near-fatal wounds.{{sfn|Burnham|1926|pp=343\u20138}}\n\nBurnham was first captured during the fighting at [[Sanna's Post]] in the Orange Free State.{{sfn|Unger|1901|p=222}} He gave himself up in order to obtain information on the enemy, which he did, and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching British occupied [[Bloemfontein]] safely after two days and nights on the run.{{sfn|Unger|1901|pp=224\u2013225}}  The second time he was captured was while trying to warn a British column approaching [[Thaba Nchu|Thaba' Nchu]].{{sfn|Atlanta Constitution|1900|p=9}} He came upon a group of Boers hiding on the banks of the river, toward which the British were even then advancing. Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush, while Burnham was at once taken prisoner. In the fight that followed, Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee, limping heavily and groaning with pain. He was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheels of the wagon, lowered himself, and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road. In an instant, the wagon had passed over him safely, and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open ''[[veld]]''. He had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of \"mielies\" (i.e., maize).{{sfn|Burnham|1926|pp=309\u201328}}{{sfn|London Chronicle|1901|p=27}}\n\n{{quote box\n| width=30em| border = 1px | align = left| bgcolor = #c6dbf7 | qalign = left\n| quote = I take this opportunity of thanking you for the valuable services you have rendered since you joined my headquarters at Paardeburg last February.

He was on a mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and supplies to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the [[Pretoria]]-[[Delagoa Bay]] railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept on his hands and knees to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel.{{sfn|Britt|1923|p=75}} His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.{{sfn|Britt|1923|p=75}}{{sfn|Burnham|1926|pp=338\u201348}}\n\n{{Burnham churchill image map|caption=Returning from the Boer War on the [[RMS Dunottar Castle|RMS ''Dunottar Castle'']], July 1900.

Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the [[House Committee on Agriculture]] to ask for help in importing large African animals.{{sfn|New York Times|1910|p=SM5}}{{sfn|Washington Post|1911|p=6}} In 1914, he helped establish the [[Wild Life Protective League of America]], Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.{{sfn|California Fish and Game|1915|p=123}}\n\nIn his later years, Burnham filled various public offices and also served as a member of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] of New York,{{sfn|Fauna of the British Empire|1930|p=308}}{{sfn|Los Angeles Times|1929|p=A3}} and as a founding member of the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection (now a committee of the [[World Conservation Union]]).{{sfn|Scientific Notes and News|1930|p=536}} He was one of the original members of the first [[California Department of Parks and Recreation|California State Parks Commission]] (serving from 1927 to 1934),{{sfn|Colby|Olmsted|1933|p=144}} a founding member of the [[Save the Redwoods League]],{{sfn|Coates|2007|p=100}} president of the [[Southwest Museum]] of Los Angeles from 1938 until 1940, and he served as both the Honorary President of the [[Scouting in Arizona|Arizona Boy Scouts]] and as a regional executive for the BSA throughout the 1940s until his death in 1947.{{sfn|Thrapp|1991|p=195}}\n\nIn 1936, Burnham enlisted the Arizona Boy Scouts in a campaign to save the [[Desert Bighorn Sheep]] from probable extinction. Several other prominent Arizonans and environmental groups joined the movement and a \"save the bighorns\" poster contest was started in schools throughout the state. Burnham provided prizes and appeared in store windows from one end of Arizona to the other. The contest-winning bighorn emblem was made into neckerchief slides for the 10,000 Boy Scouts, and talks and dramatizations were given at school assemblies and on radio. On January 18, 1939, over 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2) were set aside in Arizona to establish the [[Kofa National Wildlife Refuge]] and the [[Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge]], and Burnham gave the dedication speech.{{sfn|Saxton|1978|pp=16\u201318}}{{sfn|Arizona Highways|1941|p=7}}\n\n==Personal life==\nAt 5&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (1.62&nbsp;m), Burnham was short, but he was also muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish appearance which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.{{sfn|Davis|1906|p=194}}{{sfn|West|1932|p=173}}{{sfn|Haggard|1926|loc=Chapter XVII}}\n\nBurnham would not smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of his sense of smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took [[power naps]] instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when scouting or traveling where there was no water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.{{sfn|Davis|1906|pp=195\u20136}}{{sfn|Haggard|1926|loc=Chapter XVII}}\n\nBurnham died of heart failure at the age of 86, on September 1, 1947, at his home in Santa Barbara, California.

Together they had three children, all of whom spent their early youth in Africa. In the early years, she watched over the children and the pack animals, and she always kept a rifle nearby. In the dark of night, she used her rifle many times against lions and [[hyena]] and, during the Siege of Bulawayo, against Matabele warriors. Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia, moved with them to England, and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near Three Rivers, California. When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1923, the Burnhams moved to a mansion built by Pasadena architect [[Joseph Blick]], his brother-in-law, in a new housing development then known as Hollywoodland (a name later shortened to \"Hollywood\") and took many trips around the world in high style.{{sfn|Woods|2012|p=133}} In 1939, Blanche suffered a stroke.

[[Carncastle#Knockdhu|Knockdhu]], north of Larne, was the site of a [[Bronze Age]] [[promontory fort]] and settlement. The early coastal dwellers are thought to have had a sophisticated culture which involved trading between the shores of the North Channel and between other settlements on the coasts of Scotland. The coast of Scotland is in fact clearly visible from here. Archaeological digs in the area have found [[flint]]work and other artefacts which have been assigned dates from 6000 BC onwards. The term ''Larnian'' has even been coined by archaeologists to describe such flintworks and similar artefacts of the [[Mesolithic]] era (and one time to describe Mesolithic culture in Ireland as a whole).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|title=Larne Borough council \u2013 Local History and Heritage|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408120840/http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/larnian|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330673/Larnian-industry|title=Larnian industry \u2013 ancient culture|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref> Larnian is also currently used to refer to people from Larne.\n\nLarne takes its name from ''Latharna'', a [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] territory or ''[[t\u00faath]]'' that was part of the [[Ulaid]] minor-kingdom of ''[[D\u00e1l nAraidi]]''.<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> The name spelt as ''Latharne'' was used at one point in reference to the Anglo-Norman [[cantred]] of [[Carrickfergus]].<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> ''Latharna'' itself means \"descendants of [[Lathar]]\", with Lathar according to legend being a son of the pre-Christian king [[\u00dagaine M\u00f3r]].<ref name=\"PlacenamesLarne\"/> The town sprang up where the River Inver flows into Larne Lough.

In 1315 [[Edward the Bruce]] of Scotland (brother of [[Robert the Bruce]], King of Scotland) landed at Larne with his 6000 strong army en route to conquer Ireland, where [[Olderfleet Castle]] was of strategic importance. Edward saw Ireland as another front in the ongoing war against Norman England.\n\nIn 1569 [[Queen Elizabeth I]], Queen of England and Ireland, appointed [[Moyses Hill|Sir Moyses Hill]] as the governor of Olderfleet Castle. It was seen as strategically important for any [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest of Ulster]]. Following the 17th century [[Union of the Crowns]] of Scotland, England and Ireland under [[James VI & I]] many more settlers would have arrived to Ulster via Larne during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. The area around County Antrim itself, however, was not part of the official 17th century Plantation; instead many Scottish settlers arrived in the area through private settlement in the 17th century (as they had also been doing for centuries before).\n\nDuring the 18th century many [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] emigrated to America from the port of Larne. A monument in the Curran Park commemorates the ''Friends Goodwill'', the first emigrant ship to sail from Larne in May 1717, heading for Boston, Massachusetts in the [[New England]] region of the modern United States of America. Boston's long standing [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] roots can be traced to Larne. The town is documented as being the first in county Antrim to be taken by United Irishmen during the ill-fated [[rebellion of 1798]].  The Protestant rebels from this area (almost entirely Presbyterian) filled Larne and engaged the government forces around 2am on the morning of the 7th of June.  This surprise attack drove the garrison to flee the town, at which point the rebel force marched off to join up with [[Henry Joy McCracken|McCracken]] and fight in the [[Battle of Antrim]].<ref>Hope, J., & Newsinger, J.

Gardenmore is one of three Presbyterian Churches in the town of Larne. Although Presbyterians have been in Larne since the early 1600s, nothing is known about the origins of the congregation, although the church is believed to have been in existence for some years prior to the building of a meeting-house in 1769.\n* Larne Baptist Church\n* Larne Congregational Church. This church was founded in 1879 by Rev James Orr, but nothing is recorded about other founding members and nothing is known about Rev Orr except that his time as minister lasted for six years until 1885 and that he had died before February 1910 when the new church was built at 38\u201340 Curran road. Before this there was an old tin/iron building on the Clonlee which was the original meeting place. It was known as the tin tabernacle. After it became unusable due to rust and decay, the church members met at 139 Main street in the town and some meetings were held in Rev Archibald Mackinlay's home at 20 Clonlee. Around this time (1900 approx) monthly meetings were being held in the Intermediate school at Barnhill. This school was actually the end house in the terrace beside the Orange hall and is now a house again.\n* Larne Elim Pentecostal\n* Larne Free Presbyterian Church\n* Larne Methodist Church. This church is one of three on the Larne Circuit. The other Churches on the circuit are Craigyhill and Carnlough Methodist Churches. The Methodist Church in Larne has maintained a presence in the town ever since visits from the founder of the Methodist Church Rev John Wesley.

[[Carncastle#Knockdhu|Knockdhu]], north of Larne, was the site of a [[Bronze Age]] [[promontory fort]] and settlement. The early coastal dwellers are thought to have had a sophisticated culture which involved trading between the shores of the North Channel and between other settlements on the coasts of Scotland. The coast of Scotland is in fact clearly visible from here. Archaeological digs in the area have found [[flint]]work and other artefacts which have been assigned dates from 6000 BC onwards. The term ''Larnian'' has even been coined by archaeologists to describe such flintworks and similar artefacts of the [[Mesolithic]] era (and one time to describe Mesolithic culture in Ireland as a whole).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|title=Larne Borough council \u2013 Local History and Heritage|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408120840/http://www.larne.gov.uk/template1.asp?pid=596&area=6&text=1|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/larnian|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330673/Larnian-industry|title=Larnian industry \u2013 ancient culture|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref> Larnian is also currently used to refer to people from Larne.\n\nLarne takes its name from ''Latharna'', a [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] territory or ''[[t\u00faath]]'' that was part of the [[Ulaid]] minor-kingdom of ''[[D\u00e1l nAraidi]]''.<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> The name spelt as ''Latharne'' was used at one point in reference to the Anglo-Norman [[cantred]] of [[Carrickfergus]].<ref name=\"MacCotter229-30\"/> ''Latharna'' itself means \"descendants of [[Lathar]]\", with Lathar according to legend being a son of the pre-Christian king [[\u00dagaine M\u00f3r]].<ref name=\"PlacenamesLarne\"/> The town sprang up where the River Inver flows into Larne Lough.

In 1315 [[Edward the Bruce]] of Scotland (brother of [[Robert the Bruce]], King of Scotland) landed at Larne with his 6000 strong army en route to conquer Ireland, where [[Olderfleet Castle]] was of strategic importance. Edward saw Ireland as another front in the ongoing war against Norman England.\n\nIn 1569 [[Queen Elizabeth I]], Queen of England and Ireland, appointed [[Moyses Hill|Sir Moyses Hill]] as the governor of Olderfleet Castle. It was seen as strategically important for any [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest of Ulster]]. Following the 17th century [[Union of the Crowns]] of Scotland, England and Ireland under [[James VI & I]] many more settlers would have arrived to Ulster via Larne during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. The area around County Antrim itself, however, was not part of the official 17th century Plantation; instead many Scottish settlers arrived in the area through private settlement in the 17th century (as they had also been doing for centuries before).\n\nDuring the 18th century many [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] emigrated to America from the port of Larne. A monument in the Curran Park commemorates the ''Friends Goodwill'', the first emigrant ship to sail from Larne in May 1717, heading for Boston, Massachusetts in the [[New England]] region of the modern United States of America. Boston's long standing [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] roots can be traced to Larne. The town is documented as being the first in county Antrim to be taken by United Irishmen during the ill-fated [[rebellion of 1798]].  The Protestant rebels from this area (almost entirely Presbyterian) filled Larne and engaged the government forces around 2am on the morning of the 7th of June.  This surprise attack drove the garrison to flee the town, at which point the rebel force marched off to join up with [[Henry Joy McCracken|McCracken]] and fight in the [[Battle of Antrim]].<ref>Hope, J., & Newsinger, J.

Gardenmore is one of three Presbyterian Churches in the town of Larne. Although Presbyterians have been in Larne since the early 1600s, nothing is known about the origins of the congregation, although the church is believed to have been in existence for some years prior to the building of a meeting-house in 1769.\n* Larne Baptist Church\n* Larne Congregational Church. This church was founded in 1879 by Rev James Orr, but nothing is recorded about other founding members and nothing is known about Rev Orr except that his time as minister lasted for six years until 1885 and that he had died before February 1910 when the new church was built at 38\u201340 Curran road. Before this there was an old tin/iron building on the Clonlee which was the original meeting place. It was known as the tin tabernacle. After it became unusable due to rust and decay, the church members met at 139 Main street in the town and some meetings were held in Rev Archibald Mackinlay's home at 20 Clonlee. Around this time (1900 approx) monthly meetings were being held in the Intermediate school at Barnhill. This school was actually the end house in the terrace beside the Orange hall and is now a house again.\n* Larne Elim Pentecostal\n* Larne Free Presbyterian Church\n* Larne Methodist Church. This church is one of three on the Larne Circuit. The other Churches on the circuit are Craigyhill and Carnlough Methodist Churches. The Methodist Church in Larne has maintained a presence in the town ever since visits from the founder of the Methodist Church Rev John Wesley. Methodism seeks to be \"a friend to all and an enemy to none\" and this is what the Larne circuit has tried to achieve through many years of ministry.

This function can be shown to be convex in <math>[0,S]</math> and, invoking [[Jensen inequality]], we get\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\frac{\\frac{a}{S-a}+\\frac{b}{S-b}+\\frac{c}{S-c}}{3}\\geq \\frac{S/3}{S-S/3}.</math>\nA straightforward computation yields\n:<math>\\frac{a}{b+c}+\\frac{b}{c+a}+\\frac{c}{a+b}\\geq\\frac{3}{2}.</math>\n\n===Ninth proof: Reduction to a two-variable inequality===\nBy clearing denominators,\n:<math>\\frac{a}{b+c}+\\frac{b}{a+c}+\\frac{c}{a+b}\\geq\\frac{3}{2}\\iff2(a^3+b^3+c^3)\\geq ab^2+a^2b+ac^2+a^2c+bc^2+b^2c.</math>\nIt now suffices to prove that <math>x^3+y^3\\geq xy^2+x^2y</math>, as summing this three times for <math>(x, y) = (a, b),\\ (a, c),</math> and <math>(b, c)</math> completes the proof.\n\nAs <math>x^3+y^3\\geq xy^2+x^2y\\iff (x-y)(x^2-y^2)\\geq 0</math> we are done.\n\n== References ==\n* Nesbitt, A.M., Problem 15114, Educational Times, 3(2), 1903.\n* Ion Ionescu, Romanian Mathematical Gazette, Volume XXXII (September 15, 1926 - August 15, 1927), page 120 \n*{{cite web|title=Introduction to Inequalities|url=http://www.mediafire.com/?1mw1tkgozzu |author=Arthur Lohwater|year=1982|publisher=Online e-book in PDF format}}\n\n==External links==\n* See [http://www.mathlinks.ro/viewtopic.php?t=207221 AoPS] for more proofs of this inequality.\n* {{PlanetMath reference|id=2875|title=Nesbitt's inequality}}\n* {{PlanetMath reference|id=2876|title=proof of Nesbitt's inequality}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nesbitt's Inequality}}\n[[Category:Inequalities]]\n", "name_user": "Alexander51413", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNinth proof: Reduction to a two-variable inequality", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesbitt%27s_inequality"}
