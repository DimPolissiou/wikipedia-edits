His story was recorded by his Christian contemporaries [[Romuald Guarna]] and [[Hugo Falcandus]] from Sicily and the Muslim historian [[Ibn Khaldun]].\n\nPeter was born a Muslim in [[Djerba]] to a [[Berbers|Berberized]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] family. After his conversion he entered the service of the Sicilian crown and rose to the rank of admiral in the navy. During the reconquest of [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]]'s \"[[Kingdom of Africa]]\" by the Muslims (1159), Peter led 160 ships in a raiding expedition to the Muslim-held [[Balearic Islands]]. He later tried to relieve besieged [[Mahdia]] in North Africa with the same fleet, but soon after engaging in battle he turned around and retreated towards Sicily. While Arabic sources credit a gale with dispersing the fleet, Hugo Falcandus asserts that Peter was \"only in name and dress a Christian, and a [[Saracen]] at heart\".  Falcandus' assertion can probably be discredited, at least with respect to this point in Peter's life, for the admiral did not fall out of favour at court.

On her husband's death in 1166, the queen dowager [[Margaret of Navarre (1128\u20131183)|Margaret of Navarre]] assumed the regency for her young son [[William II of Sicily|William II]]. She trusted neither the nobility nor the church and so turned to the palatine officials and the triumvirs, of which she did not trust Matthew of Ajello. She promoted the chief eunuch, Peter, to the highest post in the kingdom, the one formerly held by Maio of Bari, but did not grant him the latter's title \"emir of emirs\" (''[[ammiratus ammiratorum]]'').\n\nPeter was despised by the nobility and soon the Queen's cousin, [[Gilbert, Count of Gravina]], was plotting against his life. Unable either to keep control of Sicily or to control Gilbert, Peter initially strengthened his bodyguard and eventually absconded, taking with him a quantity of treasure and severely embarrassing the Queen-regent. Re-assuming his birth name of Ahmed and practising Islam, he crossed to Africa and became a captain of the fleet of the [[Almohad caliph]] [[Yusuf I, Almohad Caliph|Yusuf I]]. According to Ibn Khaldun, who calls him Ahmed ''es-Sikeli'' (\"Ahmed the Sicilian\"), he fought with valour against Christian foes.\n\n==External links==\n*{{in lang|it}} [http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/aa1154a.htm \"Il Gaito Pietro\"]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ahmed Es-Sikeli}}\n[[Category:Medieval admirals]]\n[[Category:People of Sicilian descent]]\n[[Category:Sicilian Christians]]\n[[Category:People from Sicily]]\n[[Category:Tunisian people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Tunisian people of Sicilian descent]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Sicily people]]\n[[Category:Eunuchs]]\n[[Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Islam]]\n[[Category:Converts to Islam from Roman Catholicism]]\n[[Category:People from Djerba]]\n[[Category:Crypto-Islam]]\n[[Category:12th-century Tunisian people]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=November 2011}}\n\n'''Ahmed es-Sikeli''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0642\u064a\u0644\u064a}}, '''Ahmed the [[Sicilian people|Sicilian]]'''), [[baptised]] a Christian under the name '''Peter''', was a eunuch and [[kaid]] of the [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] during the reign of [[William I of Sicily|William I]].  His story was recorded by his Christian contemporaries [[Romuald Guarna]] and [[Hugo Falcandus]] from Sicily and the Muslim historian [[Ibn Khaldun]].\n\nPeter was born a Muslim in [[Djerba]] to a [[Berbers|Berberized]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] family.

Ciarallo was not only a seventh son, but underwent a special initiation rite called \"''inciaramazione''\". Customarily, one would ask Ciarallo's intercession when a snake was discovered in the house. Ciarallo would answer these requests by attracting the snake with a whistle. He would also perform the ''inciaramazione'' rite on other people to ensure protection from snakes by spreading a special oil on their arm.

Due to the large number of players now serving in the [[First World War]] it was agreed to relax transfer rules to allow players from stronger teams to join weaker teams to even the competition.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Prospects for the Season\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LIV| issue=16529\n| date = 1917-05-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170503.2.96.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-15}}</ref> It was noted how many men from various clubs had been killed in battle by the beginning of 1917. They were Cecil Walker, Doug Dawson, T Marshall ([[Grafton Athletic]]), [[Charles Savory]], T McWhirter, G Cook, N Vause, V McCollum, Alf Gault, T Lambert, E Tiernan, F Stubbs, W. G. Handle ([[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]), B Hart, F Gladding, A Powley, Chas Mann ([[North Shore Albions]]), [[William Moeki]], G Jones, W Harris, S Magee, S Greer ([[City Rovers]]), A Miller, C Sinton, and L O'Leary (Sunnyside). City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120. All three of the Sunnyside secretaries had enlisted and the executive was also gone. Ponsonby had also had over eighty of its member join the war effort.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =At the Front/Footballers Distinguish Themselves\n| page =6\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLVIII| issue=107\n| date = 1917-05-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170505.2.50\n| accessdate = 2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThirty three teams entered the six grades. This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12\u20136 win over [[City Rovers]] in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with [[Grafton Athletic]].\n\nIn 1916 the fence around [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue. The league had however secured land which would be developed as [[Carlaw Park]] with the aim being to secure the ground and gain revenue from ticket sales in the future.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=9th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1917}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1918 Auckland Rugby League season|1918]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n==First Grade Championship==\nTwenty three first grade season matches were played which was less than previous seasons but owing to the fact that both [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] and [[Grafton Athletic]] were forced to drop out of the competition due to a lack of players as a result of so many leaving to join the war effort. After their Round 4 default to North Shore where only two Otahuhu players turned up they decided to amalgamate senior teams with Grafton.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Otahuhu V North Shore\n| page =7 \n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLVIII| issue=140\n| date = 1917-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170613.2.72.2\n| accessdate = 2020-01-21}}</ref> This was short lived however as Grafton themselves only lasted until Round 7 when they themselves defaulted a week later.

This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12\u20136 win over [[City Rovers]] in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season.

To show his power, Yahweh inflicts a series of 10 plagues on the Egyptians, culminating in the 10th plague, the death of the first-born.\n\n{{quote|This is what the {{LORD}} says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.

[[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] Jews usually celebrate the holiday over seven days.

Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Numbers|9:11|HE}}), and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|NIV}}). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}), and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}) and eaten together with unleavened bread (''[[matzo]]'') and bitter herbs (''[[maror]]''). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:46|HE}}), and none of the meat could be left over by morning ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}).\n\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an [[apostate]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:43|HE}}), a [[Indentured servant|servant]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:45|HE}}), an [[Brit milah|uncircumcised man]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), a person in a state of [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]], except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (''[[Pesahim]]'' 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a [[quorum]] of 30 (''Pesahim'' 64b). In the Temple, the [[Levites]] sang [[Hallel]] while the [[Kohen|priests]] performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (''Pesahim'' 91b).\n\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the [[mitzvah]] of the ''Korban Pesach'' is memorialized in the ''Seder Korban Pesach'', a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,<ref name=Kitov>{{cite book|first=Eliyahu|last=Kitov|title=The Book of Our Heritage: The Jewish Year and Its Days of Significance|publisher=Feldheim|year=1997|page=562}}</ref> and in the form of the ''[[zeroa]]'', a symbolic food placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted [[humerus|shankbone]] (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the [[afikoman]] substitutes for the eating of the ''Korban Pesach'' at the end of the Seder meal ([[Mishnah]] Pesachim 119a). Many [[Sephardi Jews]] have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the ''Korban Pesach''.\n\n==Removing all leaven (''chametz'')==\n{{see also|Chametz#Removal of chametz}}\n[[File:BiurChametz2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins]]\nLeaven, in Hebrew ''[[Chametz#What is chametz?|chametz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05d7\u05de\u05e5</big> ''\u1e25amets'', \"[[leavening]]\") is made from one of five types of grains<ref name=Pomerantz/> combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes.

The rabbi then re-purchases the goods for less than they were sold at the end of the holiday.<ref>[http://www.torahlearningcenter.com/jhq/question169.html Pesach questions and answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143423/http://www.torahlearningcenter.com/jhq/question169.html |date=September 28, 2007}} by the Torah Learning Center.\nRetrieved on March 31, 2018</ref>\n\n==Search for leaven {{anchor|Formal search for chametz}}==\n{{main|bedikat chametz}}\n{{Wikisource|1=Translation:Talmud/Seder Moed/Tractate Pesachim/2a|2=Talmud's introduction to checking for chametz and defining ''or'' (literally, \"light\") (Tractate Pesachim 2a)}}\n\nOn the night of the fourteenth of [[Nisan]], the night before the [[Passover Seder]] (after nightfall on the evening before Passover eve), Jews do a formal search in their homes known as ''[[bedikat chametz]]'' for any possible remaining leaven (''[[chametz]]''). The [[Talmud]]ic sages instructed that a search for ''chametz'' be made in every home, place of work, or any place where ''chametz'' may have been brought during the year.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\">{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Avie |last2=Zlotowitz|first2=Meir |last3=Scherman|first3=Nosson |title=The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Pesach|date=1990\u20132002|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=0-89906-696-8|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> When the first Seder is on a Saturday night, the search is conducted on the preceding Thursday night (thirteenth of Nisan) as [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|''chametz'' cannot be burned during Shabbat]].\n\nThe [[Talmud]] in [[Pesahim]] (p.&nbsp;2a) derives from the [[Torah]] that the search for ''chametz'' be conducted by the light of a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the ''chametz'' (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at night because the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all ''chametz'' from one's possession.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n===Blessing for search of chametz and nullification of chametz===\nBefore the search is begun there is a special [[Berakhah|blessing]]. If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n:Blessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\n\nIn Hebrew:\n\n\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\n\n(''ber\u016bkh otah, YEH'WAH alihiyn\u016b, melekh ha-\u2018\u00f4lam, eser qedesh-n\u016b be-mits\u016btayu we-tsewin\u016b \u2018al be-\u00f4r \u1e25amets'')\n\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\n\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by [[candle]]light, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the ''chametz''. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\n\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for ''chametz'' will be in vain (''bracha l'vatala'') if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some ''chametz'' will be found.\n\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\n==Morning of 14th of Nissan==\nNote that if the 14th of Nissan is [[Shabbat]], many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|due to restrictions in place during Shabbat]].\n\n===Fast of the Firstborn===\n{{main|Fast of the Firstborn|siyum}}\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on [[Motza'ei Shabbat]]), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:29|HE}}, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a ''[[siyum]]'' (ceremony marking the completion of a section of [[Torah learning]]) right after [[Shacharit|morning prayers]], and the [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\n\n===Burning and nullification of leaven===\nOn the morning of the 14th of [[Nisan]], any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (''s'rayfat chametz''). The head of the household repeats the declaration of ''biyur chametz'', declaring any ''chametz'' that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\nShould more ''chametz'' actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\n\nUnlike ''chametz'', which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\n\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" [[Passover sacrifice]] (''Korban Pesach'') has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish temple]] approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\n\nHowever, the Paschal lamb is still a principal feature of [[Beta Israel|Falashah]], Karaite and Samaritan observance.\n\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3\u201311|HE}}.\n\n==Separate kosher for Passover utensils and dishes==\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat ''chametz'' (leaven) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}), observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with ''chametz'', for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some ''chametz'' utensils can be immersed in boiling water (''[[Hagalah|hagalat keilim]]'') to purge them of any traces of ''chametz'' that may have accumulated during the year. Many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that [[glass]] does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a [[blow torch]] to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called ''libun gamur'').<ref name=\"WSJblowtorch\">{{Cite news |last= Lagnado |first= Lucette |title= As Passover Nears, These Rabbis Are Getting Out Their Blowtorches |page= A1 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |location= New York |date= April 18, 2011 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704628404576264751651607740 }}</ref>\n\n==Matzah==\n{{main|Matzo}}\n[[Image:Machine-made Shmura Matzo.jpg|thumb|250px|Machine made ''shmura matza'']]\n\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is [[matzo]], an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:18|HE}}</ref> Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the [[Passover Seder]]. There are several explanations for this.\n\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=60495 |title=Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder | work =AskMoses.com \u2013 Judaism, Ask a Rabbi \u2013 Live}}</ref> Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to [[hardtack]]), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\n\nMatzo has also been called ''Lechem Oni'' (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.<ref>[http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=450 What is the kabbalistic view on chametz?] by Rabbi Yossi Marcus</ref>\n\n[[File:Shmura Matzo2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hand made ''shmura matzo'']]\n\n''Shmura matzo'' (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities.

In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"''[[Chavurah|chaburas]]''\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. ''Chaburas'' also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\n\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,<ref name=Pomerantz/> as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the ''chabura'' members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170657/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |title=Making Matzah the Old-Fashioned Way |publisher=The Jewish Federations of North America |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\n\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now ''chametz'', and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\n\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.<ref name=Pomerantz/>\n\n==Passover seder==\n[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|250px|Table set for the Passover Seder]]\n{{Main|Passover Seder}}\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside [[Land of Israel|Israel]]) for a special dinner called a [[Passover seder|seder]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8</big> ''seder'' \u2013 derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the [[Haggadah]]. Four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative. The Haggadah divides the night's procedure into 15 parts:\n\n#''Kadeish/ Qad\u0113sh'' <big>\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9</big> \u2013 recital of [[Kiddush]] blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\n#''Urchatz/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25ats/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 the [[Handwashing in Judaism|washing of the hands]] \u2013 without blessing\n#''Karpas'' <big>\u05db\u05e8\u05e4\u05e1</big> \u2013 dipping of the ''[[karpas]]'' in salt water\n#''Yachatz/ Ya\u1e25ats/ Ya\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d9\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the ''[[afikoman]]'' which is eaten later during the ritual of ''Tzafun''\n#''Maggid/ Maggiyd'' <big>\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3</big> \u2013 retelling the Passover story, including the recital of \"[[the four questions]]\" and drinking of the second cup of wine\n#''Rachtzah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7tsah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e8\u05d7\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 second washing of the hands \u2013 with blessing\n#''Motzi/ M\u00f4tsiy\u2019/ M\u00f4\u1e63iy\u2019'' <big>\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0</big> \u2013 traditional blessing before eating [[bread]] products\n#''Matzo/ Ma\u1e63o'' <big>\u05de\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 blessing before eating [[matzo]]\n#''Maror'' <big>\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8</big> \u2013 eating of the [[maror]]\n#''Koreich/ Kor\u0113kh'' <big>\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror\n#''Shulchan oreich/ Sh\u016bl\u00b7\u1e25an \u2018\u00f4r\u0113kh'' <big>\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 lit. \"set table\" \u2013 the serving of the holiday meal\n#''Tzafun/ Tsaf\u016bn/ \u1e62af\u016bn'' <big>\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df</big> \u2013 eating of the ''[[afikoman]]''\n#''Bareich/ Bar\u0113kh'' <big>\u05d1\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after the meal]] and drinking of the third cup of wine\n#''[[Hallel]]'' <big>\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc</big> \u2013 recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine\n#''Nirtzah/ Niyr\u00b7tsah/ Niyr\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 conclusion\n\nThese 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on which the [[Levite]]s stood during Temple services, and which were memorialized in the 15 [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] (#120\u2013134) known as ''Shir HaMa'a lot'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea}} ''shiyr ha-ma\u2018al\u00f4th'', \"[[Song of Ascents|Songs of Ascent]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolhator.org.il/shir_hamaalot.php |title=Shir Ha Ma'a lot |publisher=Kolhator.org.il |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of [[Kiddush]] which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the ''[[afikoman]]'', the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including ''[[Chad Gadya]]'' (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\n\n===Maror===\n[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Types of maror: grated [[horseradish]], [[romaine lettuce]], whole horseradish root]]\n[[Maror]] (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ''ve-yimareru'') their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver seder plate]]\n\n===Four cups of wine===\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of [[the Exodus]], the drinking of the third cup concludes [[Birkat Hamazon]] and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.\n\n===The four questions and participation of children===\n{{See also|The four questions}}\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, ''Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh'' (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\n\n:Why is this night different from all other nights?\n:On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\n:On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\n:On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\n:On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\n\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about [[The Exodus|the Exodus from Egypt]], the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n\n===Afikoman===\n[[File:Haggadah 15th cent.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century Haggadah]]\nThe ''afikoman'' \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called ''Yachatz'', the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the ''afikoman''. Many families use the ''afikoman'' as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the ''afikoman'' and offering a prize for its return.<ref name=Pomerantz/> Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the ''afikoman'' and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the ''afikoman'' must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, ''Tzafun''.\n\n===Concluding songs===\n\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"[[Echad Mi Yodea]]\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"[[Chad Gadya]]\" are allegorical.\n\n==Counting of the Omer==\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,<ref>[[Karaite Jews]] begin the count on the Sunday within the holiday week. This leads to Shavuot for the Karaites always falling on a Sunday.</ref> Jews begin the practice of the [[Counting of the Omer]], a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of [[Shavuot]] 50 days hence. Each night after the [[Maariv|evening prayer service]], men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs: Historical and Contemporary|first=Sol|last=Scharfstein|pages=36\u201337|year=1999|isbn=0881256269}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple stood in Jerusalem]], a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. [[Josephus]] writes:<blockquote>\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an ''assaron'' for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.<ref name=\"Barley\"/></blockquote> Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\n\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and [[mitzvot]] before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of the Omer|first=Ellen|last=Cohn|title=Ecology and the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature and the Sacred Meet|editor-first=Ellen|editor-last=Bernstein|page=164|year=2000|isbn=1580230822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qvQcZeAv4C&pg=PA164}}</ref>\n\n==Chol HaMoed: The intermediate days of Passover==\nIn [[Land of Israel|Israel]], Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major [[Jewish holidays]].

In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. [[Reform Judaism]] observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\n\nLike the holiday of [[Sukkot]], the intermediary days of Passover are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as [[macaroon]]s and homemade candies.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nPassover cake recipes call for [[potato starch]] or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use [[matzo farfel]] (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base.

We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating \"the bread of affliction\"? Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?<br />And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to \"visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.\" It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall \"be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.</blockquote>\n\n==Influence on other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:The two disciples, Peter and John, are sent to prepare the Passover (f. 32) Cropped.jpg|thumb|The two disciples, [[st Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], were sent by Christ to prepare the Passover]]\n{{see also|Easter|Passover (Christian holiday)}}\n\nThe Christian celebration of [[Good Friday]] finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the evening on which Jesus was crucified as the [[Lamb of God|Passover Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Er-QZeW12tUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Jewish Pesach and the Origins of the Christian Easter|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|first1=Clemens|last1=Leonhard |year=2012|accessdate = June 14, 2018|isbn = 978-3110927818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FqKAT_eTKMfA0AG7xMHXBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Pascha%22%20name&f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination.

To show his power, Yahweh inflicts a series of 10 plagues on the Egyptians, culminating in the 10th plague, the death of the first-born.\n\n{{quote|This is what the {{LORD}} says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.

Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Numbers|9:11|HE}}), and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|NIV}}). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}), and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}) and eaten together with unleavened bread (''[[matzo]]'') and bitter herbs (''[[maror]]''). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:46|HE}}), and none of the meat could be left over by morning ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}).\n\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an [[apostate]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:43|HE}}), a [[Indentured servant|servant]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:45|HE}}), an [[Brit milah|uncircumcised man]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), a person in a state of [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]], except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (''[[Pesahim]]'' 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a [[quorum]] of 30 (''Pesahim'' 64b). In the Temple, the [[Levites]] sang [[Hallel]] while the [[Kohen|priests]] performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (''Pesahim'' 91b).\n\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the [[mitzvah]] of the ''Korban Pesach'' is memorialized in the ''Seder Korban Pesach'', a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,<ref name=Kitov>{{cite book|first=Eliyahu|last=Kitov|title=The Book of Our Heritage: The Jewish Year and Its Days of Significance|publisher=Feldheim|year=1997|page=562}}</ref> and in the form of the ''[[zeroa]]'', a symbolic food placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted [[humerus|shankbone]] (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the [[afikoman]] substitutes for the eating of the ''Korban Pesach'' at the end of the Seder meal ([[Mishnah]] Pesachim 119a). Many [[Sephardi Jews]] have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the ''Korban Pesach''.\n\n==Removing all leaven (''chametz'')==\n{{see also|Chametz#Removal of chametz}}\n[[File:BiurChametz2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins]]\nLeaven, in Hebrew ''[[Chametz#What is chametz?|chametz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05d7\u05de\u05e5</big> ''\u1e25amets'', \"[[leavening]]\") is made from one of five types of grains<ref name=Pomerantz/> combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes.

[[Halakha|Jewish law]] requires the elimination of [[olive]]-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small.

If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n:Blessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\n\nIn Hebrew:\n\n\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\n\n(''ber\u016bkh otah, YEH'WAH alihiyn\u016b, melekh ha-\u2018\u00f4lam, eser qedesh-n\u016b be-mits\u016btayu we-tsewin\u016b \u2018al be-\u00f4r \u1e25amets'')\n\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\n\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by [[candle]]light, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the ''chametz''. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\n\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for ''chametz'' will be in vain (''bracha l'vatala'') if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some ''chametz'' will be found.\n\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\n==Morning of 14th of Nissan==\nNote that if the 14th of Nissan is [[Shabbat]], many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|due to restrictions in place during Shabbat]].\n\n===Fast of the Firstborn===\n{{main|Fast of the Firstborn|siyum}}\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on [[Motza'ei Shabbat]]), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:29|HE}}, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a ''[[siyum]]'' (ceremony marking the completion of a section of [[Torah learning]]) right after [[Shacharit|morning prayers]], and the [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\n\n===Burning and nullification of leaven===\nOn the morning of the 14th of [[Nisan]], any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (''s'rayfat chametz''). The head of the household repeats the declaration of ''biyur chametz'', declaring any ''chametz'' that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e2\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05db\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05db\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d0\n\nShould more ''chametz'' actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\n\nUnlike ''chametz'', which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\n\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" [[Passover sacrifice]] (''Korban Pesach'') has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish temple]] approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\n\nHowever, the Paschal lamb is still a principal feature of [[Beta Israel|Falashah]], Karaite and Samaritan observance.\n\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3\u201311|HE}}.\n\n==Separate kosher for Passover utensils and dishes==\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat ''chametz'' (leaven) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}), observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with ''chametz'', for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some ''chametz'' utensils can be immersed in boiling water (''[[Hagalah|hagalat keilim]]'') to purge them of any traces of ''chametz'' that may have accumulated during the year. Many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that [[glass]] does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a [[blow torch]] to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called ''libun gamur'').<ref name=\"WSJblowtorch\">{{Cite news |last= Lagnado |first= Lucette |title= As Passover Nears, These Rabbis Are Getting Out Their Blowtorches |page= A1 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |location= New York |date= April 18, 2011 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704628404576264751651607740 }}</ref>\n\n==Matzah==\n{{main|Matzo}}\n[[Image:Machine-made Shmura Matzo.jpg|thumb|250px|Machine made ''shmura matza'']]\n\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is [[matzo]], an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:18|HE}}</ref> Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the [[Passover Seder]]. There are several explanations for this.\n\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=60495 |title=Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder | work =AskMoses.com \u2013 Judaism, Ask a Rabbi \u2013 Live}}</ref> Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to [[hardtack]]), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\n\nMatzo has also been called ''Lechem Oni'' (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.<ref>[http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=450 What is the kabbalistic view on chametz?] by Rabbi Yossi Marcus</ref>\n\n[[File:Shmura Matzo2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hand made ''shmura matzo'']]\n\n''Shmura matzo'' (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities.

In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"''[[Chavurah|chaburas]]''\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. ''Chaburas'' also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\n\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,<ref name=Pomerantz/> as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the ''chabura'' members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170657/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |title=Making Matzah the Old-Fashioned Way |publisher=The Jewish Federations of North America |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\n\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now ''chametz'', and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\n\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.<ref name=Pomerantz/>\n\n==Passover seder==\n[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|250px|Table set for the Passover Seder]]\n{{Main|Passover Seder}}\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside [[Land of Israel|Israel]]) for a special dinner called a [[Passover seder|seder]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8</big> ''seder'' \u2013 derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the [[Haggadah]]. Four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative. The Haggadah divides the night's procedure into 15 parts:\n\n#''Kadeish/ Qad\u0113sh'' <big>\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9</big> \u2013 recital of [[Kiddush]] blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\n#''Urchatz/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25ats/ \u016ar\u00b7\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 the [[Handwashing in Judaism|washing of the hands]] \u2013 without blessing\n#''Karpas'' <big>\u05db\u05e8\u05e4\u05e1</big> \u2013 dipping of the ''[[karpas]]'' in salt water\n#''Yachatz/ Ya\u1e25ats/ Ya\u1e25a\u1e63'' <big>\u05d9\u05d7\u05e5</big> \u2013 breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the ''[[afikoman]]'' which is eaten later during the ritual of ''Tzafun''\n#''Maggid/ Maggiyd'' <big>\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3</big> \u2013 retelling the Passover story, including the recital of \"[[the four questions]]\" and drinking of the second cup of wine\n#''Rachtzah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7tsah/ Ra\u1e25\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e8\u05d7\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 second washing of the hands \u2013 with blessing\n#''Motzi/ M\u00f4tsiy\u2019/ M\u00f4\u1e63iy\u2019'' <big>\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0</big> \u2013 traditional blessing before eating [[bread]] products\n#''Matzo/ Ma\u1e63o'' <big>\u05de\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 blessing before eating [[matzo]]\n#''Maror'' <big>\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8</big> \u2013 eating of the [[maror]]\n#''Koreich/ Kor\u0113kh'' <big>\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror\n#''Shulchan oreich/ Sh\u016bl\u00b7\u1e25an \u2018\u00f4r\u0113kh'' <big>\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 lit. \"set table\" \u2013 the serving of the holiday meal\n#''Tzafun/ Tsaf\u016bn/ \u1e62af\u016bn'' <big>\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df</big> \u2013 eating of the ''[[afikoman]]''\n#''Bareich/ Bar\u0113kh'' <big>\u05d1\u05e8\u05da</big> \u2013 [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after the meal]] and drinking of the third cup of wine\n#''[[Hallel]]'' <big>\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc</big> \u2013 recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine\n#''Nirtzah/ Niyr\u00b7tsah/ Niyr\u00b7\u1e63ah'' <big>\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4</big> \u2013 conclusion\n\nThese 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on which the [[Levite]]s stood during Temple services, and which were memorialized in the 15 [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] (#120\u2013134) known as ''Shir HaMa'a lot'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea}} ''shiyr ha-ma\u2018al\u00f4th'', \"[[Song of Ascents|Songs of Ascent]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolhator.org.il/shir_hamaalot.php |title=Shir Ha Ma'a lot |publisher=Kolhator.org.il |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of [[Kiddush]] which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the ''[[afikoman]]'', the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including ''[[Chad Gadya]]'' (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\n\n===Maror===\n[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Types of maror: grated [[horseradish]], [[romaine lettuce]], whole horseradish root]]\n[[Maror]] (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ''ve-yimareru'') their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver seder plate]]\n\n===Four cups of wine===\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of [[the Exodus]], the drinking of the third cup concludes [[Birkat Hamazon]] and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.\n\n===The four questions and participation of children===\n{{See also|The four questions}}\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, ''Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh'' (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\n\n:Why is this night different from all other nights?\n:On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\n:On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\n:On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\n:On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\n\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about [[The Exodus|the Exodus from Egypt]], the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n\n===Afikoman===\n[[File:Haggadah 15th cent.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century Haggadah]]\nThe ''afikoman'' \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called ''Yachatz'', the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the ''afikoman''. Many families use the ''afikoman'' as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the ''afikoman'' and offering a prize for its return.<ref name=Pomerantz/> Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the ''afikoman'' and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the ''afikoman'' must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, ''Tzafun''.\n\n===Concluding songs===\n\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"[[Echad Mi Yodea]]\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"[[Chad Gadya]]\" are allegorical.\n\n==Counting of the Omer==\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,<ref>[[Karaite Jews]] begin the count on the Sunday within the holiday week. This leads to Shavuot for the Karaites always falling on a Sunday.</ref> Jews begin the practice of the [[Counting of the Omer]], a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of [[Shavuot]] 50 days hence. Each night after the [[Maariv|evening prayer service]], men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs: Historical and Contemporary|first=Sol|last=Scharfstein|pages=36\u201337|year=1999|isbn=0881256269}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple stood in Jerusalem]], a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. [[Josephus]] writes:<blockquote>\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an ''assaron'' for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.<ref name=\"Barley\"/></blockquote> Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\n\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and [[mitzvot]] before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of the Omer|first=Ellen|last=Cohn|title=Ecology and the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature and the Sacred Meet|editor-first=Ellen|editor-last=Bernstein|page=164|year=2000|isbn=1580230822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qvQcZeAv4C&pg=PA164}}</ref>\n\n==Chol HaMoed: The intermediate days of Passover==\nIn [[Land of Israel|Israel]], Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major [[Jewish holidays]]. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, no work is performed on those days, with most of the rules relating to the observances of [[Shabbat]] being applied.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nOutside Israel, in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. [[Reform Judaism]] observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\n\nLike the holiday of [[Sukkot]], the intermediary days of Passover are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as [[macaroon]]s and homemade candies.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1000452/jewish/Chol-Hamoed.htm</ref>\n\nPassover cake recipes call for [[potato starch]] or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use [[matzo farfel]] (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base.

According to the [[Midrash]], only the [[Pharaoh]] was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred.\n\n[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s traditionally hold a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]'' on the night of ''Shvi'i shel Pesach'' and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them.

Just as on the first Pesach night, breaking bones from the second Paschal offering or leaving meat over until morning is prohibited ({{Bibleref2|Numbers 9:12}}).<ref>https://www.halakhah.com/rst/pesach.pdf</ref>\n\nToday, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has the status of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it essentially does not exist outside of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and traditional [[Conservative Judaism]]). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities ''[[Tachanun]]'', a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torah.org/learning/yomtov-omer-5755-vol1no21/|title=YomTov, Vol. I, # 21 - Pesach Sheni, The \"Second\" Pesach \u2022 Torah.org}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional foods==\n[[File:Matzah brei serving.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Matzah brei]] (fried [[matzo]] and egg), a popular Passover dish]]\nBecause the house is free of leaven (''chametz'') for eight days, the Jewish household typically eats different foods during the week of Passover.

Alstat]], an early leader of [[Conservative Judaism]], known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:<ref>[[Canadian Jewish Chronicle|The Canadian Jewish Chronicle]], March 31, 1939</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps in our generation the counsel of our Talmudic sages may seem superfluous, for today the story of our enslavement in Egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism, but even more so by tragic realism. We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating \"the bread of affliction\"? Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?<br />And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to \"visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.\" It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall \"be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.</blockquote>\n\n==Influence on other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:The two disciples, Peter and John, are sent to prepare the Passover (f. 32) Cropped.jpg|thumb|The two disciples, [[st Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], were sent by Christ to prepare the Passover]]\n{{see also|Easter|Passover (Christian holiday)}}\n\nThe Christian celebration of [[Good Friday]] finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the evening on which Jesus was crucified as the [[Lamb of God|Passover Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Er-QZeW12tUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Jewish Pesach and the Origins of the Christian Easter|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|first1=Clemens|last1=Leonhard |year=2012|accessdate = June 14, 2018|isbn = 978-3110927818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FqKAT_eTKMfA0AG7xMHXBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Pascha%22%20name&f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination.

Even here, this relationship does not suddenly appear, but represents developments in ritual narrative that mus have begun at the very inception of the Christian message. Jesus of Nazareth was crucifed during Pesach-Mazzot, an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining.

The concept of Christ as a Passover lamb is generally not unknown in NT or early Christian literature, as can for instance be seen in 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Peter 1:19 or Justin Martyr's writing (''Dial''. 111:3).
