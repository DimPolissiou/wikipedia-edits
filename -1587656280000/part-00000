{"title_page": "1968 in the United States", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=October 2018}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{Yearbox US|1968}}\n\n'''1968 in the United States''' was marked by several major historical events. It is often considered to be one of the most turbulent and traumatic years of the [[20th century in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/31/us/1968-important-events/index.html|title=Eight unforgettable ways 1968 made history|first=Katie|last=McLaughlin|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nThe year began with relative peace until January 21 when the North Vietnamese Army [[PAVN]] attacked the Marine base at [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] Quang Tri Province, Vietnam. This was the beginning of the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]] and the attack focused US command on Khe Sanh near the [[DMZ]]. The initial attack was followed by the North Vietnamese country-wide launch of the [[Tet Offensive]] on January 30, 1968, resulting in a South Vietnamese-US victory, eliminating the [[Viet Cong]] as an effective fighting force. The attack included a North Vietnamese assassination attempt on South Vietnam's president [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] which failed. North Vietnam premised the attack on a South Vietnamese uprising against South Vietnam and US forces but this uprising did not occur as the South Vietnamese populace did not rally to the North. Also, on January 23 the North Korean government seized {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} and its crew of eighty-three in an attempt to divert attention from a failed January 21 assassination attempt on South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]] known as the [[Blue House raid]]. In [[Greenland]] a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] on a [[Cold War]] mission known as [[Operation Chrome Dome]] [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crashed]] with four nuclear bombs on board. One airman was killed. The cleanup operation was informally known as Operation Freezelove, a play on words on the movie ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.\n\nFour to six thousand citizens of the city of [[Hu\u1ebf]], Vietnam, deemed political enemies, were either clubbed to death or buried alive by the North Vietnamese Army. This was known as the [[Massacre at Hue]].\n\nThe year also saw the highest level of US troop commitment when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed legislation that increased the maximum number of United States troops active on the ground to five hundred and forty-nine thousand and five hundred (549,500). This did not count US forces in the [[South China Sea]], Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, North Vietnam, and China with reserves in the Philippines, [[Okinawa]], Japan, Korea, [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], the United States, and worldwide totaling over three million (3,000,000). South Vietnam in the same year fielded a total force of eight hundred and twenty thousand troops (820,000). It was also the most expensive year of the war, with a cost of $77.4 billion. The support of the United States for South Vietnam was at its peak. [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Antiwar sentiment]] continued to grow as an increasing number of Americans questioned United States involvement in Vietnam, as the United States was drafting young men to fight for South Vietnam while South Vietnam did not have a draft for its own citizens; however, the war continued despite changing US public opinion.\n\nNorth Vietnam benefited politically from the [[Tet Offensive]] when [[Walter Cronkite]], a respected television newscaster, swayed many Americans and President Johnson, by giving his personal opinion on a national prime time editorial: \"It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.\" This may have marked a transition in journalism where a news reporter became a news and policy maker. President Johnson cited Walter Cronkite's changed opinion as a factor in his decision not to seek reelection stating to his advisers: \"If I have lost Cronkite I have lost middle America.\" President Johnson later died on January 22, 1973, at age 64 from heart problems.\n\nOn April 4, [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.]]  The United States erupted in [[King assassination riots|violent riots]], the most severe of which occurred in [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots|Washington, D.C.]], [[1968 Chicago riots|Chicago]], and [[1968 Baltimore riots|Baltimore]]. Extensive areas of these and many other cities were looted, burned, and destroyed by the rioters and more than 40 people were killed during the month of protest, which led to greater racial tensions between Americans. Despite this, a landmark piece of legislation, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which was President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s legacy, was passed by the expertise of President Johnson in April. This legislation was passed with bipartisan [[United States Congress|Congressional]] support and effectively prohibited housing discrimination based on race.\n\nThe [[1968 United States Presidential election]] became a referendum on the Vietnam War. A peace candidate had previously emerged in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] challenged the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, who had refused to seek or accept another nomination for president and had endorsed his vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]], for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator McCarthy's support came primarily from young people, most of whom were subject to the draft or were in deferred status. This divided the country by age as older citizens, a so-called silent majority, tended to support or not actively oppose government policies. This division of the populace encouraged Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator Kennedy was assassinated after winning the [[California]] primary and defeating Senator Eugene McCarthy. The [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]] in June led to uncertainty in the race for the Democratic nomination for the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. After Vice President Humphrey won the Democratic nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], another wave of violent protests emerged, this time between the mostly young antiwar demonstrators and police. The uncertainty within the Democratic Party benefited [[Richard Nixon]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], as he successfully won the presidential race by appealing to the \"Silent Majority\" under the promise \"Peace with Honor\". Nixon, a staunch anti-communist, had gained the voters' trust. A particularly strong showing by segregationist [[George Wallace]] of the [[American Independent Party]] in 1968's presidential election highlighted the strong element of racial division that continued to persist across the country.\n\nIn popular culture, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was the most profitable film of the year, earning $56.7 million, while ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[the Beatles]] was the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1968|hottest single of 1968]] in the U.S. according to [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], demonstrating the continued popularity of bands associated with the [[British Invasion]] that began in 1964.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Incumbents ==\n=== Federal Government ===\n* [[President of the United States|President]]: [[Lyndon B.

It is often considered to be one of the most turbulent and traumatic years of the [[20th century in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/31/us/1968-important-events/index.html|title=Eight unforgettable ways 1968 made history|first=Katie|last=McLaughlin|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nThe year began with relative peace until January 21 when the North Vietnamese Army [[PAVN]] attacked the Marine base at [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] Quang Tri Province, Vietnam. This was the beginning of the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]] and the attack focused US command on Khe Sanh near the [[DMZ]]. The initial attack was followed by the North Vietnamese country-wide launch of the [[Tet Offensive]] on January 30, 1968, resulting in a South Vietnamese-US victory, eliminating the [[Viet Cong]] as an effective fighting force. The attack included a North Vietnamese assassination attempt on South Vietnam's president [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] which failed. North Vietnam premised the attack on a South Vietnamese uprising against South Vietnam and US forces but this uprising did not occur as the South Vietnamese populace did not rally to the North. Also, on January 23 the North Korean government seized {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} and its crew of eighty-three in an attempt to divert attention from a failed January 21 assassination attempt on South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]] known as the [[Blue House raid]]. In [[Greenland]] a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] on a [[Cold War]] mission known as [[Operation Chrome Dome]] [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crashed]] with four nuclear bombs on board. One airman was killed. The cleanup operation was informally known as Operation Freezelove, a play on words on the movie ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.\n\nFour to six thousand citizens of the city of [[Hu\u1ebf]], Vietnam, deemed political enemies, were either clubbed to death or buried alive by the North Vietnamese Army. This was known as the [[Massacre at Hue]].\n\nThe year also saw the highest level of US troop commitment when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed legislation that increased the maximum number of United States troops active on the ground to five hundred and forty-nine thousand and five hundred (549,500). This did not count US forces in the [[South China Sea]], Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, North Vietnam, and China with reserves in the Philippines, [[Okinawa]], Japan, Korea, [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], the United States, and worldwide totaling over three million (3,000,000). South Vietnam in the same year fielded a total force of eight hundred and twenty thousand troops (820,000). It was also the most expensive year of the war, with a cost of $77.4 billion. The support of the United States for South Vietnam was at its peak. [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Antiwar sentiment]] continued to grow as an increasing number of Americans questioned United States involvement in Vietnam, as the United States was drafting young men to fight for South Vietnam while South Vietnam did not have a draft for its own citizens; however, the war continued despite changing US public opinion.\n\nNorth Vietnam benefited politically from the [[Tet Offensive]] when [[Walter Cronkite]], a respected television newscaster, swayed many Americans, and President Johnson, who gave his personal opinion on a national prime time editorial that: \"It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.\" This may have marked a transition in journalism where a news reporter became a news and policy maker. President Johnson cited Walter Cronkite's changed opinion as a factor in his decision not to seek reelection stating to his advisers: \"If I have lost Cronkite I have lost middle America.\" President Johnson later died on January 22, 1973, at age 64 from heart problems.\n\nOn April 4, [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.]]  The United States erupted in [[King assassination riots|violent riots]], the most severe of which occurred in [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots|Washington, D.C.]], [[1968 Chicago riots|Chicago]], and [[1968 Baltimore riots|Baltimore]]. Extensive areas of these and many other cities were looted, burned, and destroyed by the rioters and more than 40 people were killed during the month of protest, which led to greater racial tensions between Americans. Despite this, a landmark piece of legislation, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which was President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s legacy, was passed by the expertise of President Johnson in April. This legislation was passed with bipartisan [[United States Congress|Congressional]] support and effectively prohibited housing discrimination based on race.\n\nThe [[1968 United States Presidential election]] became a referendum on the Vietnam War. A peace candidate had previously emerged in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] challenged the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, who had refused to seek or accept another nomination for president and had endorsed his vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]], for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator McCarthy's support came primarily from young people, most of whom were subject to the draft or were in deferred status. This divided the country by age as older citizens, a so-called silent majority, tended to support or not actively oppose government policies. This division of the populace encouraged Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination. Senator Kennedy was assassinated after winning the [[California]] primary and defeating Senator Eugene McCarthy. The [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]] in June led to uncertainty in the race for the Democratic nomination for the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. After Vice President Humphrey won the Democratic nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], another wave of violent protests emerged, this time between the mostly young antiwar demonstrators and police. The uncertainty within the Democratic Party benefited [[Richard Nixon]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], as he successfully won the presidential race by appealing to the \"Silent Majority\" under the promise \"Peace with Honor\". Nixon, a staunch anti-communist, had gained the voters' trust. A particularly strong showing by segregationist [[George Wallace]] of the [[American Independent Party]] in 1968's presidential election highlighted the strong element of racial division that continued to persist across the country.\n\nIn popular culture, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was the most profitable film of the year, earning $56.7 million, while ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[the Beatles]] was the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1968|hottest single of 1968]] in the U.S. according to [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], demonstrating the continued popularity of bands associated with the [[British Invasion]] that began in 1964.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Incumbents ==\n=== Federal Government ===\n* [[President of the United States|President]]: [[Lyndon B.

The webcomic follows the events at a fictional [[video game magazine]] company. Featuring many [[running gags]] and references, with a focus on [[nerd culture]]. Dylan Meconis was added as a co-writer in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://comicsworthreading.com/2013/05/13/pvp-brings-on-co-writer-dylan-meconis/ | work =Comics Worth Reading | title =PvP Brings on Co-Writer | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://archive.is/20130905161050/http://comicsworthreading.com/2013/05/13/pvp-brings-on-co-writer-dylan-meconis/ | archivedate =September 5, 2013 | df =mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy 2005, ''PvP'' was receiving around 100,000 unique visitors per day,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://extremetracking.com/open;sum?tag=pvptoon | work = eXTReMe Tracking | title = PvP}}</ref> and the webcomic has seen various print releases. On February 1, 2007, it became the subject of its own [[animated series]].\n\n==Themes==\nThe comic chronicles the adventures of a fictional video game magazine company (later to become a video game publisher) and its employees. It features many running gags that are actually references to running gags from other media (television programs, films, games, cartoons, etc.). A popular but often controversial figure in the field of online comics, Kurtz is usually willing to share his opinions about comics and gaming culture in his blog, which is hosted on the same website as his comic strips.\n\nOriginally, ''PvP'' focused on video gaming and the larger \"[[nerd]] culture\" including comics and [[Role-playing game|RPGs]]. [[1UP.com]] described it as one of the first game-based comics, but not the original, saying, \"neither Scott Kurtz's PvP nor Jerry Holkins and Michael Krahulik's [[Penny Arcade]] were the first gaming-themed webcomic on the Internet.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3145208&did=1 | title = Will Strip for Games | work = [[1UP.com]] | first = Nich | last = Maragos | date = July 11, 2005 | accessdate = March 11, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203151/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3145208&did=1 | archive-date = September 27, 2007 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Over the years, the humor has broadened to include technology jokes, relationship humor, in-jokes about and mocking of the [[generation gap]]s between the different characters, with gaming increasingly taking a back seat. Kurtz occasionally comes under fire for his satire. Sometimes Kurtz will speak of his father's open disdain for the strip.<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/2008/05/13/state-of-the-union-post-seattle/ | title = State of the union: post Seattle | date = May 13, 2008 | work = PvP Blog | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090305041148/http://www.pvponline.com/2008/05/13/state-of-the-union-post-seattle/ | archivedate = March 5, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Kurtz created a spin-off comic, entitled [[Table Titans]].

However, she was not always the good and moral figure that she appears to be. In high school, she and her friend Sam were caught stealing the answers to their chemistry final. Jade also took her stepfather's car without permission, and was subsequently charged with robbery by her stepfather in order to teach her a lesson.<ref name=\"fri-oct-20\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2006/10/20/oct-20-2006/ | title = Fri Oct 20 | date = October 20, 2006 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> Brent and Francis were delighted to learn this, since they tend to be the ones whose antics cause Jade to roll her eyes in contempt. Jade attempted to return to her old deviant ways after this revelation, but realized she didn't enjoy it as much as she once did.\n\nAlthough considered a feminist, Jade's desire to be treated as an equal often comes into conflict with her natural maternal caregiver personality. She temporarily left PvP after Francis grabbed her breast, opening her own pro-woman gaming magazine called \"Valkyrie\". Later Valkyrie merged to PvP because Jade missed her PvP-family and had problems with her workers.<ref group=\"#\">http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1999/12/10/fri-dec-10</ref>\n\nJade is often criticized for being \"unrealistic\", although Kurtz states that she is somewhat modeled after his wife.<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pvponline.com/newspro/archives/arc7-2006.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125010558/http://www.pvponline.com/newspro/archives/arc7-2006.html |archivedate=January 25, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In her first posting to the PvP blog, Angela Kurtz stated, ''\"90% of the time, when you\u2019re reading Jade, you\u2019re reading about Scott\u2019s feminine side, not about me.\"''<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pvponline.com/blog/2877/she-said |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104023726/http://www.pvponline.com/blog/2877/she-said |archivedate=November 4, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Jade and Brent dated since nearly the start of the series, they broke up for nearly a year, due to a combination of Jade's obsession with Dark age of Camelot, and her catching Brent dancing with the wife of another Dark age of Camelot player in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Although they both continued to work at PVP, they were often seen bickering and attempting to one-up each other. Jade ended up falling in love soon after with another gamer she met on another MMORPG, named Xavier. She flew out to Las Vegas to meet Xavier in person, but began to feel reluctance and guilt returning to the place where she and Brent broke up. It was then revealed that Xavier had been Brent all along, and the two rekindled their relationship, eventually marrying in 2008. In 2014, she gave birth to her and Brent's daughter, Katherine Miranda Fontaine Sienna.<ref group=\"#\">http://pvponline.com/comic/2014/03/17/newest-edition</ref>\n\n===Francis Ottoman===\n\nThe youngest member of the staff. Technical support for the office (and also known to write the occasional review), Francis is immature, easily excitable and always eager to be on the cutting edge of fads and technology. He loves his PC and routinely argues with Brent over Macs. He rarely shows interest in anything besides computers or video games, though it has been stated that he owns a prominent collection of pony figurines.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2006/08/13/aug-13-2006/ | title = Aug 13, 2006 | date = August 13, 2006 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrancis is a skilled programmer, he has on different occasions made both a robot girlfriend and a robot of himself. The girlfriend-bot eventually malfunctions when he tells it that he grabbed Jade's boob, and eventually tries to destroy her. Using the leftover parts, he makes a robot of himself, nicknamed the Francis-bot. He uses this to wait in line for tickets for Star Wars Episode 3, which comes out three years from the beginning of the story. However, when Francis returns to get his tickets, he discovers that the robot has been waiting outside of an antique mall for a year. The robot kidnaps Francis and chains him to the mall while taking his position as the real person back at PvP. The others discover him after the robot dies from a saliva overdose after kissing Marcy. Both of these times, Francis has thought the thing it was doing was more impressive building and coding, which allowed both robots to have some semblance of artificial intelligence.\n\nFrancis' appearance in the comic has gone through more changes than the other characters. His first artwork was choppy and caused reader confusion due to readers mistaking a spot for his mouth and his mouth for a \"jagged chin\" or part of his hair,<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/05/30/sat-may-30/ | title = Sat May 30 | date = May 30, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> so his design was drastically changed later. For a long time he sported a [[T-shirt]] depicting a [[human skull]], and messed-up moussed hair (the mousse was originally, and may still be, Skull's [[phlegm]]).<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2006/02/17/fri-feb-17/ | title = Fri Feb 17 | date = February 17, 2006 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDue to his consummation of his relationship with Marcy as \"predicted\" in a previous comic<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2000/01/24/mon-jan-24/ | title = Mon Jan 24 | date = January 24, 2000 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> strip, in 2008, he \"leveled up\", aging three years and developing chin scruff.<ref name=\"ding\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/05/28/ding/ | title = Ding! | date = May 28, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> In 2011, Francis \"leveled up\" again due to the company leaving [[Dallas]] for [[Seattle]] (mirroring the real life move of Scott Kurtz) and Francis being pushed into living on his own as an adult.<ref group=\"#\">[http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2011/01/13/all-grown-1up PvP - All Grown 1UP] January 13, 2011</ref> Later that year, Francis said that Marcy broke up with him via text message after she had left for [[Savannah College of Art and Design]].<ref group=\"#\">[http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2011/02/02/bring-a-pencil PVP - Bring a Pencil] February 2, 2011</ref> They reconciled after Marcy rejoins the PvP staff. After a gaming tournament in Las Vegas the two went out on a drinking spree and, while very drunk, got married. Despite initial misgivings about the relationship, Francis and Marcy have stayed together and are apparently happy.\n\nFrancis has a running gag with Cole in which they high five each other using whatever they are holding. This usually ends up in a mess with coffee, fries or blood all over the place.\n\n===Skull the Troll===\n\nA lovable [[troll]] who is assigned to be a mythological animal friend to Brent. Nervous and childlike, he had an occasional girlfriend named Sonya, although Skull was exposed to be female in an early comic.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/06/11/thu-jun-11/ | title = Thu Jun 11 | date = June 11, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> This was later revealed to be a joke,<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/07/24/fri-jul-24/ | title = Fri Jul 24 | date = July 24, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> and Skull is typically portrayed as genderless. Brent and Francis do their best to figure out which gender he really is (on one occasion watching his reaction to a lingerie magazine they had left for him to find. Skull first acts like a typical male, whistling at the pictures, then wondered to himself if they had a piece in his size and color), though Skull has implied on many occasions that he is definitely male.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2009/04/29/friendship-is-rare-part-three/ | title = Thu Apr 29 | date = April 29, 2009 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = May 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSkull debuted in another of Kurtz's web cartoons called [[Comixpedia:Samwise|Tales by Tavernlight]], which focused on the world of ''[[Ultima Online]]''. Though he seems to be an utterly harmless, rather clueless and childish creature who doesn't even seem to understand the nature of violence, Skull has a dark underside<ref name=\"pvp-20080930\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/09/30/working-with-kids/ | title = working with kids | date = September 30, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = January 5, 2010}}</ref> that the other characters sometimes see but blame on outside forces.

The middle name \"Theodore\" was recently revealed to be the long form for \"the\" (as \"Skull The Troll\"). Skull was reassigned when Brent finally got married, much to Brent's dissatisfaction. His first assignment was a boy named Kevin with a somewhat sadistic streak, who lived near [[U.S. Route 422]] in western [[Pennsylvania]],<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/06/25/busy-day/ | title = Busy Day | date = June 25, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> at least until his death due to a reckless wagon ride after four days (reader time) with Skull.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/06/27/lets-go-exploring/ | title = Let's Go Exploring | date = June 27, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> Since then, Skull has attempted to befriend parodies of the children in [[The Family Circus]], who believed him to be a demon and tried to kill him. This escapade ended when Skull was rescued by [[FoxTrot|Jason Fox]]. Thanks to Scratch and Shecky he returned to ''PvP'' and has apparently \"retired\" from his \"mentoring\" duties. He does have a new girlfriend named Val, or Valerie. She was introduced during a Magic: The Gathering session, where she almost immediately tried to kill Skull. After the fight stopped, they became a couple. Even though she sees herself as a dwarven hammermaid who is supposed to hate trolls, she still feels deep affection for him.\n\n===Max Powers===\n\nArch-enemy and rival publisher of Cole, Max Powers ran ''Powerplay'' magazine. While seemingly jovial and outgoing, for some reason Max was generally despised by the PvP crew. While perhaps not as truly evil as Brent and Cole claim, he could doubtlessly be quite annoying. Eric Burns of the webcomic review site Websnark wrote an analysis of Max suggesting that he is actually \"the good guy\" of PVP. Burns points out that nothing Max does can be nailed down as overtly malicious.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.websnark.com/archives/2004/10/because_i_keep.html | title = Because I keep my promises\u2026 the Max Powers Snark | first = Eric | last = Burns-White | date = October 11, 2004 | work = Websnark| accessdate = March 14, 2009}}</ref> (For example, he threatens to post a naked picture of Jade on the Internet unless she goes out with him, but it turns out to be a baby picture. He tells Cole about upcoming software audits, but doesn't actually report Cole to the authorities.) In the December 2, 2008 comic, four years after Burns's article, Cole admits to Max that part of the reason he finds him so irritating is that Max is a better person than he is. ''Powerplay'' merged with ''PvP'' to prevent ''PvP's'' certain financial ruin. Because of his narcissistic attitude, Max was unable to see Skull, and was unaware of the troll's existence. However, Shecky punched Max as an 'incentive to see the world beyond [his] nose', changing Max's perceptions. Unfortunately, Max thought Cole was letting the staff keep a pair of 'dogs' on the premises and said the 'yappy one' (Shecky) snapped at his face. (See March 13, 2006 blog entry.) As of December second in the strip, ''PvP'' and ''Powerplay'' have gone their separate ways, as Cole has come into a large sum of money which he will receive annually from the World Wildlife Fund, thanks to the near-constant attacks on Brent by a giant panda, and the fact that it appears the panda is now more or less living somewhere in the PvP offices. During a 2008 Thanksgiving Plot, it has been revealed that Cole believes that Max stole a \"girlfriend\" from him (they were not actually dating, but Cole believed Max made his move on her before ''he'' could). Max however adamantly denied it saying he only grew close with the girl so as to get closer to Cole and Brent. This led Cole and Brent to the assumption that Max is gay, and was attracted to one of them. The former has been confirmed in a 2011 strip in which Max admits to Jade that he is in fact gay; he begs her not to tell anyone else, and she has so far complied with his request. During a conversation with his sister Sonya, it was revealed that Max had a partner named Chris.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2011/05/27/setec-astronomy/ | title = Setec Astronomy | date = May 27, 2011 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = May 27, 2011}}</ref> Max later reveals that he is gay to the rest of the group when Lucille convinces him that it is doing him no good keeping it secret.\n\nAfter a year's absence from the strip, during which he drove cross-country on a motorcycle doing good deeds, Max returned to the PvP offices to ask Cole for a job. He is now also able to see Skull, most likely because he is now \"pure of heart\" after a year of soul-searching. The new Max, after realizing the company was doomed in a few months, broke into Cole's office and went over the financial statements to confirm his fears. After a confrontation with Cole, after which Cole confessed the state of the company to Brent, Cole set Max off to find a new business plan and opportunities. After several weeks Max returned from Seattle, advising PVP to cease publication immediately, switch to a strictly online format (which was the only portion of the business generating a profit), and move the company from Dallas to Seattle. This reflects Scott Kurtz's real-life move of a year earlier in 2010.\n\n===Scratch Fury, Destroyer of Worlds===\n\nSkull's cat. Francis attempted to give it to Brent to make the latter feel some Christmas spirit, but the ploy failed and Skull decided to take the cat in. Skull accidentally zapped him with his \"genius machine\",<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2004/02/11/wed-feb-11/ | title = Wed Feb 11 | date = February 11, 2004 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> granting him superhuman intelligence. Scratch is bent on global domination, but his evil plans for attaining it have so far been foiled by his feline foibles and proclivities.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2004/05/29/sat-may-29/ | title = Sat May 29 | date = May 29, 2004 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> He is [[Pinky and the Brain]] in the same body, and they're fighting for dominance. It is worth noting that while Scratch is still a genius \u2013 after Skull's departure, he was seen in the basement, working on a machine of some sort with a welding torch \u2013 he appears to be unable to communicate to the other members of the magazine. It has been suggested that the ambient magic surrounding Skull was what made Scratch's ability to communicate with humans possible in the first place. However, Kurtz has admitted that the lack of understanding Scratch was just a mistake, and changed the strip to have Scratch deliberately talking in cat-speak. Also, he becomes \"Kringus\" a Christmas tree-themed villain in numerous stories set in yule times. Scratch has mostly given up on evil schemes, and has focused on killing Garfield and running his \"Cool Cat Club\".\n\n=== Lolbat ===\nLolbat is Kurtz's version of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He derives his powers from a material called memetic fabric, which allows him to talk like he is in an internet meme. He fights members of the Algonquin hate table, made up of internet supervillains like The Savage Critic, The Scrabbler, and the Mad Hater. He also serves as Robbie's manservant during the day. Lolbat has recently acquired a sidekick named Retweet (also known as Wade), who talks like a Twitter post. He is also assisted by Jade's sister Miranda, who discovered the lair of the Lolbat and decided to assist him by becoming the Instagirl, a phone based superhero.\n\n==Publication==\n\n===Online strip===\nThe first online strip was posted on Monday, May 4, 1998.<ref name=\"mon-may-04\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/05/04/mon-may-04/ | title = Mon May 04 | date = May 4, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009}}</ref> Kurtz normally updates the strip every day but has occasionally missed updates since the comic's inception, less so after the PVP 2.0 revamp. In April 2005, Kurtz changed to a Monday through Friday schedule, with Friday's strip in color and sketches on Saturday and Sunday, in response to the mounting work he had taken on as a monthly comic at Image and associated side projects. On June 4, 2005, Scott Kurtz posted on his blog that he was returning to the daily schedule. On May 6, 2008, Kurtz reaffirmed the strip to a Monday through Friday schedule.<ref name=\"moving forward\" group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/05/06/moving-forward/ | title = Moving forward | date = May 6, 2008 | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | work = PvP Blog | accessdate = March 11, 2009}}</ref> Although the strip was initially formatted 2\u00d72 to fit on 800\u00d7600 resolution screens, it switched to \"widescreen\" (1\u00d74) on February 3, 2003.<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/article/1525/Mon-Feb-03 | title = My God\u2026it's full of STARS! | date = February 3, 2003 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217062041/http://www.pvponline.com/article/1525/Mon-Feb-03 | archivedate = February 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The strip celebrated its 10th anniversary on Sunday, May 4, 2008 with the wedding of two of PvP's main characters, Brent Sienna and Jade Fontaine.<ref name=\"the-vows\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/05/04/the-vows/ | title = The vows| date = May 4, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally single strips or short series have been presented drawn by guest cartoonists, such as [[KC Green]].<ref name=\"guest-strip-kc-green\" group=\"p\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2010/04/16/guest-strip-by-kc-green/|title=PvPOnline Guest Strip by KC Green|date=April 16, 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Print versions===\n\nPreviously, [[Dork Tower|Dork Storm Press]] printed 6 issues of original content as well as a trade paperback of online strips. The Dork Storm issues were collected into a trade paperback entitled \"The Dork Ages.\"\n\nIn March 2003, [[Image Comics]] began publishing a monthly print comic book collection of the strip that combined old strips with new material. Publication of single issues and the Image partnership ended in March 2010 after over 7 years and 45 issues. In addition to publishing single issues Image released a 16-page primer (numbered as #0), and seven trade paperbacks (each collecting 6 issues) \u2013 \"''PvP: At Large''\" (#1\u20136), \"''PvP: Reloaded''\" (#7\u201312), \"''PvP Rides Again''\" (#13\u201318), \"''PVP Goes Bananas''\" (#19\u201325), \"''PvP Treks On''\" (#25\u201330), \"''PvP Silent But Deadly''\" and \"''PVP Levels Up''\". A 10-year anniversary collection, Awesomology Deluxe, was also published by Image in 2009. After the ending of the Image partnership Kurtz switched to self publishing the print editions but only in collected form.\n\nAt the 2004 [[San Diego Comicon]], Kurtz announced that he would offer to newspapers the entire ''PvP'' series to reprint for free,<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/rants_panel.php3 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024021033/http://www.pvponline.com/rants_panel.php3 | archivedate = October 24, 2007 | title = SDCC 2004 \u2013 Part Four | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | date = July 30, 2004 | accessdate = March 12, 2009}}</ref> but only if the strips were reprinted without any changes made. Kurtz said he made this offer because of his dissatisfaction with the terms offered to cartoonists by [[Print syndication|syndicate]]s. {{As of|2011}} no major American newspaper has agreed to regularly pick up his strip, even though it is free. One newspaper, ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', briefly ran one PvP strip per week in the fall of 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/main/sites/default/files/rage/109985777882575.htm|work=[[Comics Bulletin]]|title=All Over But The Shouting|last=Marnell|first=Blair|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n===''PvP: The Series''===\nKurtz announced on November 27, 2006 that from February 2007, a [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] cartoon series would be available over the internet via a subscription service, produced in conjunction with [[Blind Ferret Entertainment#Blind Ferret Entertainment|Blind Ferret Entertainment]].

On February 1, 2007, it became the subject of its own [[animated series]].\n\n==Themes==\nThe comic chronicles the adventures of a fictional video game magazine company (later to become a video game publisher) and its employees. It features many running gags that are actually references to running gags from other media (television programs, films, games, cartoons, etc.). A popular but often controversial figure in the field of online comics, Kurtz is usually willing to share his opinions about comics and gaming culture in his blog, which is hosted on the same website as his comic strips.\n\nOriginally, ''PvP'' focused on video gaming and the larger \"[[nerd]] culture\" including comics and [[Role-playing game|RPGs]]. [[1UP.com]] described it as one of the first game-based comics, but not the original, saying, \"neither Scott Kurtz's PvP nor Jerry Holkins and Michael Krahulik's [[Penny Arcade]] were the first gaming-themed webcomic on the Internet.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3145208&did=1 | title = Will Strip for Games | work = [[1UP.com]] | first = Nich | last = Maragos | date = July 11, 2005 | accessdate = March 11, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203151/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3145208&did=1 | archive-date = September 27, 2007 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Over the years, the humor has broadened to include technology jokes, relationship humor, in-jokes about and mocking of the [[generation gap]]s between the different characters, with gaming increasingly taking a back seat. Kurtz occasionally comes under fire for his satire. Sometimes Kurtz will speak of his father's open disdain for the strip.<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/2008/05/13/state-of-the-union-post-seattle/ | title = State of the union: post Seattle | date = May 13, 2008 | work = PvP Blog | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090305041148/http://www.pvponline.com/2008/05/13/state-of-the-union-post-seattle/ | archivedate = March 5, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Kurtz created a spin-off comic, entitled [[Table Titans]].

Instead he exchanged his shades for regular prescription glasses. However, after realizing that he was losing his cool factor, Jade has allowed him to occasionally wear his sunglasses again.\n\nBrent is an avid consumer of Apple computers and products. He refuses to use PCs and considers [[Microsoft]] to be evil, even forbidding the use of PCs in his house.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2004/01/14/wed-jan-14/ | title = Wed Jan 14 | date = January 14, 2004 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> He is a founding member of an Apple fanatics group called The Honorable Order of Macintosh Operators (or H.O.M.O. \u2013 the name is a running gag in the strip).\n\nAlthough Brent is not a gamer, unlike the rest of the staff, he does occasionally play ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' with H.O.M.O. (as well as with Jade), and played ''[[City of Heroes]]'' with Cole, Francis, and Skull as part of the ''City of Heroes'' special edition comic packed with the game, as well as its counterpart, ''[[City of Villains]]'' in a later strip seen on the site, but neither game has been referenced beyond those strips.

She plays [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]]-style games such as ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and also chats online with friends she's made in the series.\n\nAlong with Cole, Jade often plays the straight-man of the group and is often the voice of reason compared to the rest of the cast. However, she was not always the good and moral figure that she appears to be. In high school, she and her friend Sam were caught stealing the answers to their chemistry final. Jade also took her stepfather's car without permission, and was subsequently charged with robbery by her stepfather in order to teach her a lesson.<ref name=\"fri-oct-20\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2006/10/20/oct-20-2006/ | title = Fri Oct 20 | date = October 20, 2006 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> Brent and Francis were delighted to learn this, since they tend to be the ones whose antics cause Jade to roll her eyes in contempt. Jade attempted to return to her old deviant ways after this revelation, but realized she didn't enjoy it as much as she once did.\n\nAlthough considered a feminist, Jade's desire to be treated as an equal often comes into conflict with her natural maternal caregiver personality. She temporarily left PvP after Francis grabbed her breast, opening her own pro-woman gaming magazine called \"Valkyrie\". Later Valkyrie merged to PvP because Jade missed her PvP-family and had problems with her workers.<ref group=\"#\">http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1999/12/10/fri-dec-10</ref>\n\nJade is often criticized for being \"unrealistic\", although Kurtz states that she is somewhat modeled after his wife.<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pvponline.com/newspro/archives/arc7-2006.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125010558/http://www.pvponline.com/newspro/archives/arc7-2006.html |archivedate=January 25, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In her first posting to the PvP blog, Angela Kurtz stated, ''\"90% of the time, when you\u2019re reading Jade, you\u2019re reading about Scott\u2019s feminine side, not about me.\"''<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pvponline.com/blog/2877/she-said |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104023726/http://www.pvponline.com/blog/2877/she-said |archivedate=November 4, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Jade and Brent dated since nearly the start of the series, they broke up for nearly a year, due to a combination of Jade's obsession with Dark age of Camelot, and her catching Brent dancing with the wife of another Dark age of Camelot player in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Although they both continued to work at PVP, they were often seen bickering and attempting to one-up each other. Jade ended up falling in love soon after with another gamer she met on another MMORPG, named Xavier. She flew out to Las Vegas to meet Xavier in person, but began to feel reluctance and guilt returning to the place where she and Brent broke up. It was then revealed that Xavier had been Brent all along, and the two rekindled their relationship, eventually marrying in 2008. In 2014, she gave birth to her and Brent's daughter, Katherine Miranda Fontaine Sienna.<ref group=\"#\">http://pvponline.com/comic/2014/03/17/newest-edition</ref>\n\n===Francis Ottoman===\n\nThe youngest member of the staff. Technical support for the office (and also known to write the occasional review), Francis is immature, easily excitable and always eager to be on the cutting edge of fads and technology. He loves his PC and routinely argues with Brent over Macs. He rarely shows interest in anything besides computers or video games, though it has been stated that he owns a prominent collection of pony figurines.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2006/08/13/aug-13-2006/ | title = Aug 13, 2006 | date = August 13, 2006 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrancis is a skilled programmer, he has on different occasions made both a robot girlfriend and a robot of himself. The girlfriend-bot eventually malfunctions when he tells it that he grabbed Jade's boob, and eventually tries to destroy her. Using the leftover parts, he makes a robot of himself, nicknamed the Francis-bot. He uses this to wait in line for tickets for Star Wars Episode 3, which comes out three years from the beginning of the story. However, when Francis returns to get his tickets, he discovers that the robot has been waiting outside of an antique mall for a year. The robot kidnaps Francis and chains him to the mall while taking his position as the real person back at PvP. The others discover him after the robot dies from a saliva overdose after kissing Marcy. Both of these times, Francis has thought the thing it was doing was more impressive building and coding, which allowed both robots to have some semblance of artificial intelligence.\n\nFrancis' appearance in the comic has gone through more changes than the other characters. His first artwork was choppy and caused reader confusion due to readers mistaking a spot for his mouth and his mouth for a \"jagged chin\" or part of his hair,<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/05/30/sat-may-30/ | title = Sat May 30 | date = May 30, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> so his design was drastically changed later.

After a gaming tournament in Las Vegas the two went out on a drinking spree and, while very drunk, got married. Despite initial misgivings about the relationship, Francis and Marcy have stayed together and are apparently happy.\n\nFrancis has a running gag with Cole in which they high five each other using whatever they are holding. This usually ends up in a mess with coffee, fries or blood all over the place.\n\n===Skull the Troll===\n\nA lovable [[troll]] who is assigned to be a mythological animal friend to Brent. Nervous and childlike, he had an occasional girlfriend named Sonya, although Skull was exposed to be female in an early comic.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/06/11/thu-jun-11/ | title = Thu Jun 11 | date = June 11, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> This was later revealed to be a joke,<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/07/24/fri-jul-24/ | title = Fri Jul 24 | date = July 24, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> and Skull is typically portrayed as genderless. Brent and Francis do their best to figure out which gender he really is (on one occasion watching his reaction to a lingerie magazine they had left for him to find. Skull first acts like a typical male, whistling at the pictures, then wondered to himself if they had a piece in his size and color), though Skull has implied on many occasions that he is definitely male.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2009/04/29/friendship-is-rare-part-three/ | title = Thu Apr 29 | date = April 29, 2009 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = May 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSkull debuted in another of Kurtz's web cartoons called [[Comixpedia:Samwise|Tales by Tavernlight]], which focused on the world of ''[[Ultima Online]]''. Though he seems to be an utterly harmless, rather clueless and childish creature who doesn't even seem to understand the nature of violence, Skull has a dark underside<ref name=\"pvp-20080930\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/09/30/working-with-kids/ | title = working with kids | date = September 30, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = January 5, 2010}}</ref> that the other characters sometimes see but blame on outside forces.

The middle name \"Theodore\" was recently revealed to be the long form for \"the\" (as \"Skull The Troll\"). Skull was reassigned when Brent finally got married, much to Brent's dissatisfaction. His first assignment was a boy named Kevin with a somewhat sadistic streak, who lived near [[U.S. Route 422]] in western [[Pennsylvania]],<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/06/25/busy-day/ | title = Busy Day | date = June 25, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> at least until his death due to a reckless wagon ride after four days (reader time) with Skull.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/06/27/lets-go-exploring/ | title = Let's Go Exploring | date = June 27, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> Since then, Skull has attempted to befriend parodies of the children in [[The Family Circus]], who believed him to be a demon and tried to kill him. This escapade ended when Skull was rescued by [[FoxTrot|Jason Fox]]. Thanks to Scratch and Shecky he returned to ''PvP'' and has apparently \"retired\" from his \"mentoring\" duties. He does have a new girlfriend named Val, or Valerie. She was introduced during a Magic: The Gathering session, where she almost immediately tried to kill Skull. After the fight stopped, they became a couple. Even though she sees herself as a dwarven hammermaid who is supposed to hate trolls, she still feels deep affection for him.\n\n===Max Powers===\n\nArch-enemy and rival publisher of Cole, Max Powers ran ''Powerplay'' magazine. While seemingly jovial and outgoing, for some reason Max was generally despised by the PvP crew. While perhaps not as truly evil as Brent and Cole claim, he could doubtlessly be quite annoying. Eric Burns of the webcomic review site Websnark wrote an analysis of Max suggesting that he is actually \"the good guy\" of PVP. Burns points out that nothing Max does can be nailed down as overtly malicious.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.websnark.com/archives/2004/10/because_i_keep.html | title = Because I keep my promises\u2026 the Max Powers Snark | first = Eric | last = Burns-White | date = October 11, 2004 | work = Websnark| accessdate = March 14, 2009}}</ref> (For example, he threatens to post a naked picture of Jade on the Internet unless she goes out with him, but it turns out to be a baby picture. He tells Cole about upcoming software audits, but doesn't actually report Cole to the authorities.) In the December 2, 2008 comic, four years after Burns's article, Cole admits to Max that part of the reason he finds him so irritating is that Max is a better person than he is. ''Powerplay'' merged with ''PvP'' to prevent ''PvP's'' certain financial ruin. Because of his narcissistic attitude, Max was unable to see Skull, and was unaware of the troll's existence. However, Shecky punched Max as an 'incentive to see the world beyond [his] nose', changing Max's perceptions. Unfortunately, Max thought Cole was letting the staff keep a pair of 'dogs' on the premises and said the 'yappy one' (Shecky) snapped at his face. (See March 13, 2006 blog entry.) As of December second in the strip, ''PvP'' and ''Powerplay'' have gone their separate ways, as Cole has come into a large sum of money which he will receive annually from the World Wildlife Fund, thanks to the near-constant attacks on Brent by a giant panda, and the fact that it appears the panda is now more or less living somewhere in the PvP offices. During a 2008 Thanksgiving Plot, it has been revealed that Cole believes that Max stole a \"girlfriend\" from him (they were not actually dating, but Cole believed Max made his move on her before ''he'' could). Max however adamantly denied it saying he only grew close with the girl so as to get closer to Cole and Brent. This led Cole and Brent to the assumption that Max is gay, and was attracted to one of them. The former has been confirmed in a 2011 strip in which Max admits to Jade that he is in fact gay; he begs her not to tell anyone else, and she has so far complied with his request. During a conversation with his sister Sonya, it was revealed that Max had a partner named Chris.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2011/05/27/setec-astronomy/ | title = Setec Astronomy | date = May 27, 2011 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = May 27, 2011}}</ref> Max later reveals that he is gay to the rest of the group when Lucille convinces him that it is doing him no good keeping it secret.\n\nAfter a year's absence from the strip, during which he drove cross-country on a motorcycle doing good deeds, Max returned to the PvP offices to ask Cole for a job. He is now also able to see Skull, most likely because he is now \"pure of heart\" after a year of soul-searching. The new Max, after realizing the company was doomed in a few months, broke into Cole's office and went over the financial statements to confirm his fears. After a confrontation with Cole, after which Cole confessed the state of the company to Brent, Cole set Max off to find a new business plan and opportunities. After several weeks Max returned from Seattle, advising PVP to cease publication immediately, switch to a strictly online format (which was the only portion of the business generating a profit), and move the company from Dallas to Seattle. This reflects Scott Kurtz's real-life move of a year earlier in 2010.\n\n===Scratch Fury, Destroyer of Worlds===\n\nSkull's cat. Francis attempted to give it to Brent to make the latter feel some Christmas spirit, but the ploy failed and Skull decided to take the cat in. Skull accidentally zapped him with his \"genius machine\",<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2004/02/11/wed-feb-11/ | title = Wed Feb 11 | date = February 11, 2004 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> granting him superhuman intelligence. Scratch is bent on global domination, but his evil plans for attaining it have so far been foiled by his feline foibles and proclivities.<ref group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2004/05/29/sat-may-29/ | title = Sat May 29 | date = May 29, 2004 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> He is [[Pinky and the Brain]] in the same body, and they're fighting for dominance. It is worth noting that while Scratch is still a genius \u2013 after Skull's departure, he was seen in the basement, working on a machine of some sort with a welding torch \u2013 he appears to be unable to communicate to the other members of the magazine. It has been suggested that the ambient magic surrounding Skull was what made Scratch's ability to communicate with humans possible in the first place. However, Kurtz has admitted that the lack of understanding Scratch was just a mistake, and changed the strip to have Scratch deliberately talking in cat-speak. Also, he becomes \"Kringus\" a Christmas tree-themed villain in numerous stories set in yule times. Scratch has mostly given up on evil schemes, and has focused on killing Garfield and running his \"Cool Cat Club\".\n\n=== Lolbat ===\nLolbat is Kurtz's version of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He derives his powers from a material called memetic fabric, which allows him to talk like he is in an internet meme. He fights members of the Algonquin hate table, made up of internet supervillains like The Savage Critic, The Scrabbler, and the Mad Hater. He also serves as Robbie's manservant during the day. Lolbat has recently acquired a sidekick named Retweet (also known as Wade), who talks like a Twitter post. He is also assisted by Jade's sister Miranda, who discovered the lair of the Lolbat and decided to assist him by becoming the Instagirl, a phone based superhero.\n\n==Publication==\n\n===Online strip===\nThe first online strip was posted on Monday, May 4, 1998.<ref name=\"mon-may-04\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/1998/05/04/mon-may-04/ | title = Mon May 04 | date = May 4, 1998 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009}}</ref> Kurtz normally updates the strip every day but has occasionally missed updates since the comic's inception, less so after the PVP 2.0 revamp. In April 2005, Kurtz changed to a Monday through Friday schedule, with Friday's strip in color and sketches on Saturday and Sunday, in response to the mounting work he had taken on as a monthly comic at Image and associated side projects. On June 4, 2005, Scott Kurtz posted on his blog that he was returning to the daily schedule. On May 6, 2008, Kurtz reaffirmed the strip to a Monday through Friday schedule.<ref name=\"moving forward\" group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/05/06/moving-forward/ | title = Moving forward | date = May 6, 2008 | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | work = PvP Blog | accessdate = March 11, 2009}}</ref> Although the strip was initially formatted 2\u00d72 to fit on 800\u00d7600 resolution screens, it switched to \"widescreen\" (1\u00d74) on February 3, 2003.<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/article/1525/Mon-Feb-03 | title = My God\u2026it's full of STARS! | date = February 3, 2003 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217062041/http://www.pvponline.com/article/1525/Mon-Feb-03 | archivedate = February 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The strip celebrated its 10th anniversary on Sunday, May 4, 2008 with the wedding of two of PvP's main characters, Brent Sienna and Jade Fontaine.<ref name=\"the-vows\" group=\"#\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2008/05/04/the-vows/ | title = The vows| date = May 4, 2008 | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | accessdate = March 11, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally single strips or short series have been presented drawn by guest cartoonists, such as [[KC Green]].<ref name=\"guest-strip-kc-green\" group=\"p\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2010/04/16/guest-strip-by-kc-green/|title=PvPOnline Guest Strip by KC Green|date=April 16, 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Print versions===\n\nPreviously, [[Dork Tower|Dork Storm Press]] printed 6 issues of original content as well as a trade paperback of online strips. The Dork Storm issues were collected into a trade paperback entitled \"The Dork Ages.\"\n\nIn March 2003, [[Image Comics]] began publishing a monthly print comic book collection of the strip that combined old strips with new material. Publication of single issues and the Image partnership ended in March 2010 after over 7 years and 45 issues. In addition to publishing single issues Image released a 16-page primer (numbered as #0), and seven trade paperbacks (each collecting 6 issues) \u2013 \"''PvP: At Large''\" (#1\u20136), \"''PvP: Reloaded''\" (#7\u201312), \"''PvP Rides Again''\" (#13\u201318), \"''PVP Goes Bananas''\" (#19\u201325), \"''PvP Treks On''\" (#25\u201330), \"''PvP Silent But Deadly''\" and \"''PVP Levels Up''\". A 10-year anniversary collection, Awesomology Deluxe, was also published by Image in 2009. After the ending of the Image partnership Kurtz switched to self publishing the print editions but only in collected form.\n\nAt the 2004 [[San Diego Comicon]], Kurtz announced that he would offer to newspapers the entire ''PvP'' series to reprint for free,<ref group=\"p\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pvponline.com/rants_panel.php3 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024021033/http://www.pvponline.com/rants_panel.php3 | archivedate = October 24, 2007 | title = SDCC 2004 \u2013 Part Four | work = PvP | first = Scott | last = Kurtz | date = July 30, 2004 | accessdate = March 12, 2009}}</ref> but only if the strips were reprinted without any changes made. Kurtz said he made this offer because of his dissatisfaction with the terms offered to cartoonists by [[Print syndication|syndicate]]s. {{As of|2011}} no major American newspaper has agreed to regularly pick up his strip, even though it is free. One newspaper, ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', briefly ran one PvP strip per week in the fall of 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/main/sites/default/files/rage/109985777882575.htm|work=[[Comics Bulletin]]|title=All Over But The Shouting|last=Marnell|first=Blair|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n===''PvP: The Series''===\nKurtz announced on November 27, 2006 that from February 2007, a [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] cartoon series would be available over the internet via a subscription service, produced in conjunction with [[Blind Ferret Entertainment#Blind Ferret Entertainment|Blind Ferret Entertainment]].

The original club was founded in 1919, while the current incarnation was founded through a merger in 1974. Montpellier currently plays in [[Ligue 1]], the top level of [[Football in France|French football]] and plays its home matches at the [[Stade de la Mosson]], located within the city. The first team is managed by [[Michel Der Zakarian]] and [[Captain (association football)|captained]] by [[Defender (football)|defender]] [[Vitorino Hilton|Hilton]].\n\nMontpellier was founded under the name Stade Olympique Montpelli\u00e9rain (SOM) and played under the name for most of its existence. In 1989, after playing under various names, the club changed its name to its current form. Montpellier is one of the [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|founding members]] of the first division of French football. Along with [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] and [[OGC Nice|Nice]], Montpellier is one of only a few clubs to have played in the inaugural 1932\u201333 season and is still playing in the first division. The club won Ligue 1 for the first time in the [[2011\u201312 Ligue 1|2011\u201312 season]]. Montpellier's other honours to date include winning the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1929 Coupe de France Final|1929]] and [[1990 Coupe de France Final|1990]], and the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup|1999]].\n\nMontpellier is owned by Laurent Nicollin, the son of the late Louis Nicollin, a French entrepreneur, who had been owner since 1974. The club have produced several famous players in its history, most notably [[Laurent Blanc]], who has served as manager of the [[France national football team|France national team]]. Blanc is also the club's all-time leading goalscorer. [[Eric Cantona]], [[Roger Milla]], [[Carlos Valderrama]] and [[Olivier Giroud]] are other players who have played in Montpellier's colours. In 2001, Montpellier introduced a [[Montpellier HSC (Ladies)|women's team]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:1919 SOM.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|SO Montpellier team in 1919]]\n\nMontpellier H\u00e9rault Sport Club was founded in 1919 under the name Stade Olympique Montpelli\u00e9rain by the Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Sportive Montpelli\u00e9raine (AGSM) ({{lang-en|General Montpellier Sports Association}}), which consisted of a handful of wealthy and ambitious citizens of [[Montpellier]]. The city of Montpellier had been in the process of creating a sports club in the city since 1914, however, the idea died due to World War I. Upon its creation, the [[sports club]] mainly engaged in association football, [[rugby union]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], tennis, and [[boxing]]. The club's headquarters was located at the local Caf\u00e9 de Paris and carried the colours of the city, red and white. After a few months of existence, SO Montpellier, under the advisement of its first president, merged with local club ''La Vie au Grand Air du Languedoc'' (VGAL), which was formed in August 1917 and had been solely dedicated to the sport of football.\n\nThe successful merger with VGAL and the acquisition of the club's players allowed Montpellier to easily adapt in the sport. The club spent its formative years playing mainly in the ''Division d'Honneur Sud-Est''. In 1925, the club was managed by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Victor Gibson]]. That same year, Montpellier endured an internal crisis after the [[French Football Federation]] discovered that the club had been guilty of financial [[misfeasance]]. The club's president was suspended from football for five years and Montpellier were relegated for the first time. The resulting penalties led to the departure of several players. In an effort to rebuild, the club changed its name to ''Sports Olympiques Montpelli\u00e9rains'' and recruited several new players, most notably [[Branislav Sekuli\u0107]], [[Roger Rolhion]], and the three Kramer brothers from [[Switzerland]]. The rebuilding process was immediate as the club returned to the Division d'Honneur after one season. In 1929, the club won its first major trophy, the [[Coupe de France]]. In [[1929 Coupe de France Final|the final]], Montpellier faced [[FC S\u00e8te]] and recorded a 2\u20130 victory courtesy of goals from Auguste Kramer and [[Edmond Kramer]].\n\n[[File:SO Montpellier vainqueur de la Coupe de France 1929.jpg|thumb|left|200px|SOM in 1929 with Coupe de France trophy]]\n\nIn July 1930, the [[National Council of the French Football Federation|National Council]] of the [[French Football Federation]] voted 128\u201320 in support of professionalism in French football. Montpellier, along with most clubs from the south, were among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional and were founding members of the new league. Ahead of the first campaign, Montpellier continued to perform well in the Coupe de France and reached the final for the second time in three years in 1931. Montpeller were unable to win its second title after being dismantled 3\u20130 in [[1931 Coupe de France Final|the final]] by [[Club Fran\u00e7ais]]. In the [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|league's inaugural season]], Montpellier finished mid-table in its group. After two more seasons in the league, Montpellier were relegated after finishing in 15th place in 1935. Soon after, it was revealed that the club was [[French franc|\u20a3]]370,000 in debt. The club's steering committee decided to dissolve the club and return to its former name ''Stade Olympique Montpelli\u00e9rain'', which resulted in the club's debt being erased in the eyes of the federation. The new club remained in Division 2 until earning promotion to Division 1 after winning the second division in 1946. In Montpellier's return to Division 1, the club struggled finishing in the bottom-half of the table in three straight seasons. In 1950, the club was back in Division 2 after finishing 17th in the [[1949\u201350 French Division 1]] season.\n\nAfter a short return to Division 1, Montpellier were back in the second division in 1953. In the spring of 1953, the club's president, known by the surname Fox, brought in former [[France national football team|French international]] [[Julien Darui]] to act as a player-coach. After nine months, Darui was dismissed from his position. After the departure of Darui, the club was ordered to pay up to \u20a35&nbsp;million after the federation discovered financial and accounting irregularities in the club's accounts. The federation subsequently gave Fox a lifetime ban from French football. In November 1957, a local clergyman, Ferdinand Bess\u00e8de, was named as president of the club. Bess\u00e8de quickly cleaned up the club's finances and, by 1961, Montpellier were back in Division 1. After an encouraging 8th-place finish in its return, Montpellier faltered back down to Division 2 after finishing in 19th place in the [[1962\u201363 French Division 1|1962\u201363 season]]. In 1966, Bess\u00e8de, because of his duties as a clergyman, left his post. Montpellier, as a consequence, began to plummet. The club went back into debt and, also, became disassociated with its supporters after departing its long-time stadium and moving into a new stadium, which supporters were highly critical of. By 1969, Montpellier had lost its professional status and were playing in the [[Championnat de France amateur]].\n\n[[File:Laurent Blanc 23.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Laurent Blanc]] played with the team from 1983\u20131991.]]\n\nFrom 1969\u20131987, Montpellier underwent two name changes and spent its time playing in the CFA and Division 2, excluding one year back in Division 1 in 1981. In 1970, in an effort to avoid bankruptcy, the club merged with ''Montpellier Littoral'' and played under the name ''Montpellier Littoral Sport Club'' #MLSC) for four years. Despite the merger, the club still had financial troubles, which led to struggles domestically. The problems led to several players leaving the club for ''Formation Sportive de Nettoiement'', an emerging sports outfit led by entrepreneur [[Louis Nicollin]]. On 1 June 1974, the club merged with up-and-coming club ''AS Paillade'' and changed its name to ''Montpellier Paillade Sport Club Littoral'' #MPSCL#. Like the previous merger, the merger with Paillade was ultimately unsuccessful as the club failed to make any progress. At the urging of local journalist Carlo Llorens, MPSCL merged with Nicollin's club, which had quickly become competitive. Nicollin dissolved his club, was installed as Montpellier's president, and brought his players and management over to Montpellier. After slowly ascending up the league system with managers such as [[Robert Nouzaret]], [[Kader Firoud]], and Jacques Bonnet, Montpellier returned to the first division under the leadership of [[Michel M\u00e9zy]] for the [[1987\u201388 French Division 1|1987\u201388 season]].\n\nIn 1989, the club was renamed '''Montpellier H\u00e9rault Sport Club''' after it received financial support from the General Council of [[H\u00e9rault]]. With the club competing consistently in the first division, Montpellier sought to increase its competitiveness by hiring [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]]. Jacquet had won three titles with [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in the 1980s. Montpellier also had\na group of talented players, notably [[Laurent Blanc]], [[Eric Cantona]], [[Daniel Xuereb]], [[Wilbert Suvrijn]] and [[Carlos Valderrama]], among others. Jacquet only spent eight months in charge, which was a stint described by many as chaotic. A dressing room incident involving Cantona marred the club for most of the league season and, in February 1990, Jacquet was replaced by M\u00e9zy, who decided to return to the club. Under M\u00e9zy, Montpellier shifted back to its normal ways and surprised many by winning the Coupe de France. The club defeated the likes of [[FC Istres|Istres]], [[AS Nancy|Nancy]], and [[CS Louhans-Cuiseaux|Louhans-Cuiseaux]] before beating [[Racing Levallois 92|Racing Paris]] 2\u20131 in [[1990 Coupe de France Final|the final]] courtesy of [[extra time]] goals from [[Laurent Blanc]] and [[Kader Ferhaoui]]. After the success, M\u00e9zy left the club again and several of the club's players slowly began to depart for better opportunities. Despite the departures, Montpellier remained in Division 1 for the next decade before falling to Division 2 at the start of the new millennium.\n\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 GIRARD.JPG|thumb|Ren\u00e9 Girard, former manager.]]\n\nAfter a short return to Division 3, also called [[Championnat National]], from 2001 to 2004, Montpellier were back playing in Ligue 2. The club spent one season under Nouzaret and two seasons under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Domergue]] before finding stability with [[Rolland Courbis]] in 2007. In Courbis' [[2008\u201309 Ligue 2|second season in charge]], boasted by several talented young players, such as [[V\u00edctor Hugo Monta\u00f1o]], [[Tino Costa]], [[Joris Marveaux]] and [[Johann Carrasso]], he led the club back to Ligue 1 after finishing second. After the season, Courbis left the club to begin his prison sentence due to his involvement in the Olympique de Marseille corruption case and he was replaced by [[Ren\u00e9 Girard (footballer)|Ren\u00e9 Girard]]. With an abundance of young talent, Girard sought to bring in veterans to the club ahead of its return to Ligue 1. He successfully recruited [[Emir Spahi\u0107]], [[Cyril Jeunechamp]] and [[Romain Pitau]]. Girard also brought back [[Nenad D\u017eodi\u0107]], who he installed as captain. During the club's return, Montpellier surprised many football pundits, locally and internationally, by finishing in fifth place and qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. Montpellier even topped the table at one point during the season.\n\nIn 2011\u201312, Montpellier won its first Ligue 1 title, finishing the season with 82 points, three points ahead of runners-up [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. On 20 May 2012, in a game marred by stoppages for crowd violence, [[John Utaka]] scored a brace to secure a 2\u20131 victory over Auxerre and win the Ligue 1 title for Montpellier. [[Olivier Giroud]], who finished the season with 21 goals and 9 assists, was the league's top goal scorer. Despite being tied on goals with Paris Saint-Germain attacker [[Nen\u00ea (footballer, born 1981)|Nen\u00ea]], he was named the league's top scorer by the Ligue de Football Professionnel due to finishing with more goals in open play.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/article/olivier-giroud-couronne.htm | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Olivier Giroud couronn\u00e9 |date =20 May 2012| accessdate = 17 June 2012| language = French }}</ref> Since winning the Ligue 1 title, Montpellier have established themselves as a comfortable mid table side and in the 2017/2018 season the club finished 10th.<ref>http://www.ligue1.com/club/montpellier-herault-sc</ref>\n\n== Rivals ==\nMontpellier supporters view [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] as their greatest enemies in a rivalry that began to become more important from the start of the 1980s when the N\u00eemois had regional supremacy. Louis Nicollin&nbsp;\u2013 who bought Montpellier in the 1970s&nbsp;\u2013 also showed himself to be happy to contribute to the rivalry by bring a number of ex-N\u00eemes players to the club, such as [[Michel M\u00e9zy]]. M\u00e9zy agreed to join Montpellier before the end of the 1978\u201379 season and was banned from playing for the remainder of the season by the N\u00eemes president after the signing of the deal. When ''Les Crocodiles'' and Montpellier found each other together in Ligue 2, the rivalry became yet stronger, as regional power began to shift towards Montpellier. The zenith of the rivalry came in the [[1995\u201396 Coupe de France]] semi-final. Unfancied N\u00eemes, now in Ligue 2, came up against Ligue 1 Montpellier and beat them by a goal to nil.\n\n== Players ==\n\n=== Current squad ===\n<!-- This section is for current squad only.

sp\u0254\u0281 kl\u0153b}}), commonly referred to as '''Montpellier HSC''' or simply '''Montpellier''', is a  [[France|French]] professional [[association football]] club based in the city of [[Montpellier]] in [[Occitanie]]. The original club was founded in 1919, while the current incarnation was founded through a merger in 1974. Montpellier currently plays in [[Ligue 1]], the top level of [[Football in France|French football]] and plays its home matches at the [[Stade de la Mosson]], located within the city. The first team is managed by [[Michel Der Zakarian]] and [[Captain (association football)|captained]] by [[Defender (football)|defender]] [[Vitorino Hilton|Hilton]].\n\nMontpellier was founded under the name Stade Olympique Montpelli\u00e9rain (SOM) and played under the name for most of its existence. In 1989, after playing under various names, the club changed its name to its current form. Montpellier is one of the [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|founding members]] of the first division of French football. Along with [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] and [[OGC Nice|Nice]], Montpellier is one of only a few clubs to have played in the inaugural 1932\u201333 season and is still playing in the first division. The club won Ligue 1 for the first time in the [[2011\u201312 Ligue 1|2011\u201312 season]]. Montpellier's other honours to date include winning the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1929 Coupe de France Final|1929]] and [[1990 Coupe de France Final|1990]], and the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup|1999]].\n\nMontpellier is owned by Laurent Nicollin, the son of the late Louis Nicollin, a French entrepreneur, who had been owner since 1974. The club have produced several famous players in its history, most notably [[Laurent Blanc]], who has served as manager of the [[France national football team|France national team]]. Blanc is also the club's all-time leading goalscorer. [[Eric Cantona]], [[Roger Milla]], [[Carlos Valderrama]] and [[Olivier Giroud]] are other players who have played in Montpellier's colours. In 2001, Montpellier introduced a [[Montpellier HSC (Ladies)|women's team]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:1919 SOM.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|SO Montpellier team in 1919]]\n\nMontpellier H\u00e9rault Sport Club was founded in 1919 under the name Stade Olympique Montpelli\u00e9rain by the Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Sportive Montpelli\u00e9raine (AGSM) ({{lang-en|General Montpellier Sports Association}}), which consisted of a handful of wealthy and ambitious citizens of [[Montpellier]]. The city of Montpellier had been in the process of creating a sports club in the city since 1914, however, the idea died due to World War I. Upon its creation, the [[sports club]] mainly engaged in association football, [[rugby union]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], tennis, and [[boxing]]. The club's headquarters was located at the local Caf\u00e9 de Paris and carried the colours of the city, red and white. After a few months of existence, SO Montpellier, under the advisement of its first president, merged with local club ''La Vie au Grand Air du Languedoc'' (VGAL), which was formed in August 1917 and had been solely dedicated to the sport of football.\n\nThe successful merger with VGAL and the acquisition of the club's players allowed Montpellier to easily adapt in the sport. The club spent its formative years playing mainly in the ''Division d'Honneur Sud-Est''. In 1925, the club was managed by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Victor Gibson]]. That same year, Montpellier endured an internal crisis after the [[French Football Federation]] discovered that the club had been guilty of financial [[misfeasance]]. The club's president was suspended from football for five years and Montpellier were relegated for the first time. The resulting penalties led to the departure of several players. In an effort to rebuild, the club changed its name to ''Sports Olympiques Montpelli\u00e9rains'' and recruited several new players, most notably [[Branislav Sekuli\u0107]], [[Roger Rolhion]], and the three Kramer brothers from [[Switzerland]]. The rebuilding process was immediate as the club returned to the Division d'Honneur after one season. In 1929, the club won its first major trophy, the [[Coupe de France]]. In [[1929 Coupe de France Final|the final]], Montpellier faced [[FC S\u00e8te]] and recorded a 2\u20130 victory courtesy of goals from Auguste Kramer and [[Edmond Kramer]].\n\n[[File:SO Montpellier vainqueur de la Coupe de France 1929.jpg|thumb|left|200px|SOM in 1929 with Coupe de France trophy]]\n\nIn July 1930, the [[National Council of the French Football Federation|National Council]] of the [[French Football Federation]] voted 128\u201320 in support of professionalism in French football. Montpellier, along with most clubs from the south, were among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional and were founding members of the new league. Ahead of the first campaign, Montpellier continued to perform well in the Coupe de France and reached the final for the second time in three years in 1931. Montpeller were unable to win its second title after being dismantled 3\u20130 in [[1931 Coupe de France Final|the final]] by [[Club Fran\u00e7ais]]. In the [[1932\u201333 French Division 1|league's inaugural season]], Montpellier finished mid-table in its group. After two more seasons in the league, Montpellier were relegated after finishing in 15th place in 1935. Soon after, it was revealed that the club was [[French franc|\u20a3]]370,000 in debt. The club's steering committee decided to dissolve the club and return to its former name ''Stade Olympique Montpelli\u00e9rain'', which resulted in the club's debt being erased in the eyes of the federation. The new club remained in Division 2 until earning promotion to Division 1 after winning the second division in 1946. In Montpellier's return to Division 1, the club struggled finishing in the bottom-half of the table in three straight seasons. In 1950, the club was back in Division 2 after finishing 17th in the [[1949\u201350 French Division 1]] season.\n\nAfter a short return to Division 1, Montpellier were back in the second division in 1953. In the spring of 1953, the club's president, known by the surname Fox, brought in former [[France national football team|French international]] [[Julien Darui]] to act as a player-coach. After nine months, Darui was dismissed from his position. After the departure of Darui, the club was ordered to pay up to \u20a35&nbsp;million after the federation discovered financial and accounting irregularities in the club's accounts. The federation subsequently gave Fox a lifetime ban from French football. In November 1957, a local clergyman, Ferdinand Bess\u00e8de, was named as president of the club. Bess\u00e8de quickly cleaned up the club's finances and, by 1961, Montpellier were back in Division 1. After an encouraging 8th-place finish in its return, Montpellier faltered back down to Division 2 after finishing in 19th place in the [[1962\u201363 French Division 1|1962\u201363 season]]. In 1966, Bess\u00e8de, because of his duties as a clergyman, left his post. Montpellier, as a consequence, began to plummet. The club went back into debt and, also, became disassociated with its supporters after departing its long-time stadium and moving into a new stadium, which supporters were highly critical of. By 1969, Montpellier had lost its professional status and were playing in the [[Championnat de France amateur]].\n\n[[File:Laurent Blanc 23.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Laurent Blanc]] played with the team from 1983\u20131991.]]\n\nFrom 1969\u20131987, Montpellier underwent two name changes and spent its time playing in the CFA and Division 2, excluding one year back in Division 1 in 1981. In 1970, in an effort to avoid bankruptcy, the club merged with ''Montpellier Littoral'' and played under the name ''Montpellier Littoral Sport Club'' #MLSC) for four years. Despite the merger, the club still had financial troubles, which led to struggles domestically. The problems led to several players leaving the club for ''Formation Sportive de Nettoiement'', an emerging sports outfit led by entrepreneur [[Louis Nicollin]]. On 1 June 1974, the club merged with up-and-coming club ''AS Paillade'' and changed its name to ''Montpellier Paillade Sport Club Littoral'' #MPSCL#. Like the previous merger, the merger with Paillade was ultimately unsuccessful as the club failed to make any progress. At the urging of local journalist Carlo Llorens, MPSCL merged with Nicollin's club, which had quickly become competitive. Nicollin dissolved his club, was installed as Montpellier's president, and brought his players and management over to Montpellier. After slowly ascending up the league system with managers such as [[Robert Nouzaret]], [[Kader Firoud]], and Jacques Bonnet, Montpellier returned to the first division under the leadership of [[Michel M\u00e9zy]] for the [[1987\u201388 French Division 1|1987\u201388 season]].\n\nIn 1989, the club was renamed '''Montpellier H\u00e9rault Sport Club''' after it received financial support from the General Council of [[H\u00e9rault]]. With the club competing consistently in the first division, Montpellier sought to increase its competitiveness by hiring [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]]. Jacquet had won three titles with [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in the 1980s. Montpellier also had\na group of talented players, notably [[Laurent Blanc]], [[Eric Cantona]], [[Daniel Xuereb]], [[Wilbert Suvrijn]] and [[Carlos Valderrama]], among others. Jacquet only spent eight months in charge, which was a stint described by many as chaotic. A dressing room incident involving Cantona marred the club for most of the league season and, in February 1990, Jacquet was replaced by M\u00e9zy, who decided to return to the club. Under M\u00e9zy, Montpellier shifted back to its normal ways and surprised many by winning the Coupe de France. The club defeated the likes of [[FC Istres|Istres]], [[AS Nancy|Nancy]], and [[CS Louhans-Cuiseaux|Louhans-Cuiseaux]] before beating [[Racing Levallois 92|Racing Paris]] 2\u20131 in [[1990 Coupe de France Final|the final]] courtesy of [[extra time]] goals from [[Laurent Blanc]] and [[Kader Ferhaoui]]. After the success, M\u00e9zy left the club again and several of the club's players slowly began to depart for better opportunities. Despite the departures, Montpellier remained in Division 1 for the next decade before falling to Division 2 at the start of the new millennium.\n\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 GIRARD.JPG|thumb|Ren\u00e9 Girard, former manager.]]\n\nAfter a short return to Division 3, also called [[Championnat National]], from 2001 to 2004, Montpellier were back playing in Ligue 2. The club spent one season under Nouzaret and two seasons under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Domergue]] before finding stability with [[Rolland Courbis]] in 2007. In Courbis' [[2008\u201309 Ligue 2|second season in charge]], boasted by several talented young players, such as [[V\u00edctor Hugo Monta\u00f1o]], [[Tino Costa]], [[Joris Marveaux]] and [[Johann Carrasso]], he led the club back to Ligue 1 after finishing second. After the season, Courbis left the club to begin his prison sentence due to his involvement in the Olympique de Marseille corruption case and he was replaced by [[Ren\u00e9 Girard (footballer)|Ren\u00e9 Girard]]. With an abundance of young talent, Girard sought to bring in veterans to the club ahead of its return to Ligue 1. He successfully recruited [[Emir Spahi\u0107]], [[Cyril Jeunechamp]] and [[Romain Pitau]]. Girard also brought back [[Nenad D\u017eodi\u0107]], who he installed as captain. During the club's return, Montpellier surprised many football pundits, locally and internationally, by finishing in fifth place and qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. Montpellier even topped the table at one point during the season.\n\nIn 2011\u201312, Montpellier won its first Ligue 1 title, finishing the season with 82 points, three points ahead of runners-up [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. On 20 May 2012, in a game marred by stoppages for crowd violence, [[John Utaka]] scored a brace to secure a 2\u20131 victory over Auxerre and win the Ligue 1 title for Montpellier. [[Olivier Giroud]], who finished the season with 21 goals and 9 assists, was the league's top goal scorer. Despite being tied on goals with Paris Saint-Germain attacker [[Nen\u00ea (footballer, born 1981)|Nen\u00ea]], he was named the league's top scorer by the Ligue de Football Professionnel due to finishing with more goals in open play.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/article/olivier-giroud-couronne.htm | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Olivier Giroud couronn\u00e9 |date =20 May 2012| accessdate = 17 June 2012| language = French }}</ref> Since winning the Ligue 1 title, Montpellier have established themselves as a comfortable mid table side and in the 2017/2018 season the club finished 10th.<ref>http://www.ligue1.com/club/montpellier-herault-sc</ref>\n\n== Rivals ==\nMontpellier supporters view [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] as their greatest enemies in a rivalry that began to become more important from the start of the 1980s when the N\u00eemois had regional supremacy. Louis Nicollin&nbsp;\u2013 who bought Montpellier in the 1970s&nbsp;\u2013 also showed himself to be happy to contribute to the rivalry by bring a number of ex-N\u00eemes players to the club, such as [[Michel M\u00e9zy]]. M\u00e9zy agreed to join Montpellier before the end of the 1978\u201379 season and was banned from playing for the remainder of the season by the N\u00eemes president after the signing of the deal. When ''Les Crocodiles'' and Montpellier found each other together in Ligue 2, the rivalry became yet stronger, as regional power began to shift towards Montpellier. The zenith of the rivalry came in the [[1995\u201396 Coupe de France]] semi-final. Unfancied N\u00eemes, now in Ligue 2, came up against Ligue 1 Montpellier and beat them by a goal to nil.\n\n== Players ==\n\n=== Current squad ===\n<!-- This section is for current squad only.
