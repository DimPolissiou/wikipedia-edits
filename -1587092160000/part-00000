The game was one of the first mass-produced, three-dimensional board games.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Mouse Trap|url=https://toytales.ca/mouse-trap/|website=ToyTales.ca}}</ref> Over the course of the game, players at first cooperate to build a working [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg]]\u2013like [[mouse trap]].  Once the mouse trap has been built, players turn against each other, attempting to trap opponents' [[mouse]]-shaped game pieces.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n=== Original version ===\nThe basic premise of the game has been consistent over time, but the turn-based gameplay has changed. The original version, designed by Hank Kramer of [[Ideal Toy Company]], allows the players almost no decision-making, in keeping with other games for very young children such as ''[[Candyland]]'' or ''[[Snakes and Ladders|Chutes and Ladders]]'' (''Snakes and Ladders''). Players take turns rolling a die to advance their mouse piece along a path around the game board, from the start space to a continuous loop at the end. The [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg]]-like mouse trap is assembled in the center of the board, with players adding one or more of its pieces when they land on specified \"build\" spaces. The trap is always assembled in a specified order, and is attached to the board by inserting tabs into holes and locking them into place.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-1963\"/>\n\nAlong the ending loop are addition \"build\" spaces (in case the trap is still not completed), a \"cheese\" space positioned directly underneath the trap's cage, and a \"turn crank\" space. If a player lands on the \"turn crank\" space when an opponent is on the \"cheese\" space, the crank can be turned on the machine to launch it and trap that opponent.

The game was one of the first mass-produced, three-dimensional board games.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Mouse Trap|url=https://toytales.ca/mouse-trap/|website=ToyTales.ca}}</ref> Over the course of the game, players at first cooperate to build a working [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg]]\u2013like [[mouse trap]].  Once the mouse trap has been built, players turn against each other, attempting to trap opponents' [[mouse]]-shaped game pieces.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n=== Original version ===\nThe basic premise of the game has been consistent over time, but the turn-based gameplay has changed. The original version, designed by Hank Kramer of [[Ideal Toy Company]], allows the players almost no decision-making, in keeping with other games for very young children such as ''[[Candyland]]'' or ''[[Snakes and Ladders|Chutes and Ladders]]'' (''Snakes and Ladders''). Players take turns rolling a die to advance their mouse piece along a path around the game board, from the start space to a continuous loop at the end. The [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg]]-like mouse trap is assembled in the center of the board, with players adding one or more of its pieces when they land on specified \"build\" spaces. The trap is always assembled in a specified order, and is attached to the board by inserting tabs into holes and locking them into place.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-1963\"/>\n\nAlong the ending loop are addition \"build\" spaces (in case the trap is still not completed), a \"cheese\" space positioned directly underneath the trap's cage, and a \"turn crank\" space. If a player lands on the \"turn crank\" space when an opponent is on the \"cheese\" space, the crank can be turned on the machine to launch it and trap that opponent. The winner is then the last one remaining after all the other players are captured.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-1963\">{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2679/mouse-trap|title=Mouse Trap (1963)|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref>\n\n=== Revised versions ===\nIn 1975, the board game surrounding the Mouse Trap was redesigned by [[Sid Sackson]], adding the cheese pieces and allowing the player to maneuver opponents onto the trap space.<ref name=\"A Board Game Education\">{{cite book|title=A Board Game Education|last=Hinebaugh|first=Jeffrey|year=2009|publisher=R&L Education|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvqw9vK0R8sC|access-date=18 January 2013}}</ref>{{rp|36}} Players collect cheese-shaped tokens during the game, and if the trap space is vacant when they land on the \"turn crank\" space, the tokens can be redeemed for a die roll to move an opponent.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-1963\"/>\n\nA modified version was released in the United Kingdom in 2004, featuring three mousetraps (with a specialized trigger working at random) and a completely different board and plastic components.<ref name=\"A Board Game Education\"/>{{rp|38}} Among the changed trap components in this version is the incision of a model toilet instead of a model bathtub.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-2004\">{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24985/mouse-trap|title=Mouse Trap (2004)|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref>\n\nA version of the game featuring characters from the ''[[Elefun]] and Friends'' universe was introduced in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101141912/http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony/en_US/shop/details.cfm?R=6F8F1F83-5056-9047-F549-B780AB71DD61:en_US|title=Elefun and Friends Mouse Trap &#124; Games for ages 4 YEARS & UP &#124; Hasbro|date=November 1, 2014|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jinxykids.com/mouse-trap/|title=New Mouse Trap Elefun & Friends Game Review|date=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Licensing controversy==\nThe game designer [[Marvin Glass]] (and his company, [[Marvin Glass and Associates]]) refused to pay licensing fees or royalties to [[Rube Goldberg]], though acknowledging inspiration from Goldberg as well as the clear similarities between the game and a Goldberg drawing.

The game is a [[prequel]] to the 1984 game ''[[Tir Na Nog (game)|Tir Na Nog]]''. The plot of the game has [[Celt]]ic hero [[Cuchulainn]] on his search to find his companion [[L\u00f3eg]] in the mysterious city of Dun Darach. Inspiration for the game came from the works of [[Fritz Lieber]] and [[Michael Moorcock]].\n\nThe background history is based on [[Celt]]ic folklore about the hero [[Cuchulainn]], and his battles against the people of [[Connachta]] in ancient [[Ireland]]. ''Dun Darach'' received positive reviews from video game critics. It was re-released by on different game compilations and on  [[Covermount|cover tapes]] in issues of British video game magazines.\n\n==Plot and gameplay==\n[[File:Dun Darach gameplay.png|left|thumb|Gameplay of ''Dun Darach'']]\nOne day [[Cuchulainn]] was travelling home from a battle with the Connachta with his companion [[L\u00f3eg]] the charioteer. On the way, they stopped off at an [[inn]] and L\u00f3eg was persuaded to help a beautiful young woman named Skar whose [[chariot]] was damaged. Cuchulainn took refreshment at the inn and on leaving realised L\u00f3eg was missing. He later discovered that Skar is a sorceress and ally of the Connachta and had taken L\u00f3eg to the timeless Secret City of Dun Darach in retribution for the death of Prince Amhair. Cuchulainn went on a long search for the mysterious city and eventually discovered it and entered Dun Darach to find L\u00f3eg.<ref name=Crash1/>\n\n''Dun Darach'' is an [[arcade adventure]] video game. The player guides Cuchulainn through Dun Darach and interacts with the environment by selecting from performing commands by typing them from the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]. The main objective is to find L\u00f3eg, taking [[side quests]] from [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). These NPCs can give short hints to the player, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. Commands the player input can have Cuchulainn buy, steal and sell goods from shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum), and deposit money at a bank with daily [[compound interest]]. The city of Dun Darach is large and consists of different quarters with shops and the current time of the day is indicated by torches in the wall and by the greetings of characters.<ref name=\"gameplaymanual\">{{cite book|year=1986|title=Dun Darach instruction manual|publisher=Gargoyle Games}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n''Dun Darach'' was developed by Greg Follis and Roy Carter, the co-founders of game developer [[Gargoyle Games]].

Inspiration for the game came from the works of [[Fritz Lieber]] and [[Michael Moorcock]].\n\nThe background history is based on [[Celt]]ic folklore about the hero [[Cuchulainn]], and his battles against the people of [[Connachta]] in ancient [[Ireland]]. ''Dun Darach'' received positive reviews from video game critics.

On the way, they stopped off at an [[inn]] and L\u00f3eg was persuaded to help a beautiful young woman named Skar whose [[chariot]] was damaged. Cuchulainn took refreshment at the inn and on leaving realised L\u00f3eg was missing. He later discovered that Skar is a sorceress and ally of the Connachta and had taken L\u00f3eg to the timeless Secret City of Dun Darach in retribution for the death of Prince Amhair. Cuchulainn went on a long search for the mysterious city and eventually discovered it and entered Dun Darach to find L\u00f3eg.<ref name=Crash1/>\n\n''Dun Darach'' is an [[arcade adventure]] video game. The player guides Cuchulainn through Dun Darach and interact with the environment by selecting from performing commands by typing them from the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]. The main objective is to find L\u00f3eg, taking [[side quests]] from [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). These NPCs can give short hints to the player, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. Commands the player input can have Cuchulainn buy, steal and sell goods from shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum), and deposit money at a bank with daily [[compound interest]]. The city of Dun Darach is large and consists of different quarters with shops and the current time of the day is indicated by torches in the wall and by the greetings of characters.<ref name=\"gameplaymanual\">{{cite book|year=1986|title=Dun Darach instruction manual|publisher=Gargoyle Games}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n''Dun Darach'' was developed by Greg Follis and Roy Carter, the co-founders of game developer [[Gargoyle Games]].
