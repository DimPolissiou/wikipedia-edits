Deacon's condition resulted in significant muscular ''[[Muscle tone|tonus]]'', a tendency for muscular [[flexion]] of arms and extension of legs. This virtually prevented [[Fine motor skill|fine motor control]] in his hands, arms and legs. Although Deacon could walk with assistance, he mostly used a wheelchair. Deacon's speech was also unintelligible to most, bar his closest friends.\n\nDeacon was [[institutionalisation|institutionalised]] as a child and later made shoes in [[Sheltered housing|sheltered accommodation]]. As he was unable to communicate freely, he was mistakenly perceived to be \"mentally [[wikt:subnormal|subnormal]]\" by some peers. However, with the help of his friends Ernie Roberts, Tom Blackburn and Michael Sangster, Deacon was able to write an [[autobiography]], entitled ''Tongue Tied'', which was published by the charity [[Mencap]] as part of their ''Subnormality in the Seventies'' series. The book provided insight into the lives of those with physical disabilities. With royalties raised from book sales and donations, Deacon and his friends purchased a home that they would be able to reside in.\n\n== Early life ==\nAlways believing him to be mentally normal and intelligent, his mother would ask him to count the motor cars passing at the front of their house, to which Joey would respond by blinking for each car that passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judascow.com/jistory.html |title=Judascow copy of Blue Peter 18th Book article, includes photographs |publisher=Judascow.com |accessdate=2011-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116180544/http://www.judascow.com/jistory.html |archivedate=16 November 2011 }}</ref> During his childhood in the hospital, he proved his intelligence several times in tests, using non-verbal communication such as blinking or pointing with his nose.\n\nDeacon had a number of leg surgeries at St Childe's Hospital when he was around four, but these were not successful.<ref name=\"Extracts from 'Tongue Tied'\">{{cite web|author=Log |url=http://www.disappointment.com/old/joeydeacon/tongue9.htm |title=Extracts from 'Tongue Tied' |publisher=Disappointment.com |date=12 February 1928 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031050048/http://www2.disappointment.com/old/joeydeacon/tongue9.htm |archivedate=31 October 2011 }}</ref> At six, his mother died of [[tuberculosis]] and Joey was raised by his grandmother. At eight, following several more operations, he was admitted to Queen Mary's Hospital in [[Carshalton]], then transferred six months later to [[St Lawrence's Hospital, Caterham|Caterham Mental Hospital]] (latterly St Lawrence's Hospital), where he remained for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"The Imbeciles Asylum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/MAB-Caterham/|title=The Imbeciles Asylum, Caterham|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> He remained in close contact with his father until his father's death.\n\n== ''Tongue Tied'' ==\nIn 1970, Deacon began to write his autobiography with three friends. Ernie Roberts, who also had cerebral palsy, had been in hospital since the age of ten and was able to understand Deacon's speech. Roberts listened to Deacon's dictation and repeated it to another patient, Michael Sangster, who wrote it down in longhand. After proof-reading by Chris Ring, a student who visited the team each week, it was typed by a fourth member of the team, Tom Blackburn, who was initially unable to read or write but taught himself to type in order to help. The forty-four page book took fourteen months to write. BBC Radio 4's ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' ran a feature on Joey and his manuscript and the resulting publicity led to the BBC TV documentary.\n\n== Later life ==\n\nThe four men formed an inseparable friendship in the hospital for decades, and in 1974 their relationship was the subject of a [[Prix Italia]] and [[BAFTA]] award-winning drama documentary for British television's ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' written by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]] and directed by [[Brian Gibson (director)|Brian Gibson]], entitled ''Joey''. This was followed by a second documentary made for ''[[Blue Peter]]''.\n\nAs soon as ''Tongue Tied'' was completed, the team started work on a second book. Joey wanted to write a work of fiction: a novel about a disabled man who was desperate to learn to walk so that he could walk up the aisle and marry his girlfriend. It was never published.\n\nRoyalties from ''Tongue Tied'' and donations raised enough money for the four to move to a bungalow on the Caterham hospital grounds in 1979, where they were able to live more independently. After Deacon died two years later at 61, Blackburn and Roberts moved to a house outside the grounds, where they lived with the assistance of support workers.\n\n== ''Blue Peter'' and cultural impact ==\n\nIn 1981, during the last year of his life, Joey Deacon was featured on the children's magazine programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'' for the International Year of the Disabled. He was presented as an example of a man who achieved a lot in spite of his disabilities. Despite the sensitive way in which Blue Peter covered his life, the impact on the public was not as intended. The sights and sounds of Deacon's distinctive speech and mannerisms were picked up on by children and he quickly became a figure of ridicule in school playgrounds across the country, the term \"Joey\" being used as an insult for a person perceived to be stupid.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rose |first=Damon |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4902432.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; The s-word |publisher=BBC News |date=12 April 2006 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=McAlpine |first=Fraser |url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/10/frasers-phrases-throw-a-wobbly/ |title=Fraser's Phrases: \u2018Throw A Wobbly\u2019 |publisher=BBC America |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=2014-11-27}}</ref>\n\n== Posthumous impact ==\nIn 1982, Deacon's story was the subject of a paper by D.

These axioms [of homeopathy] are not only out of line with scientific facts but also directly opposed to them. If homeopathy is correct, much of physics, chemistry, and pharmacology must be incorrect.... To have an open mind about homeopathy or similarly implausible forms of alternative medicine (e.g., [[Bach flower remedies]], [[spiritual healing]], [[crystal therapy]]) is therefore not an option. We think that a belief in homeopathy exceeds the tolerance of an open mind. We should start from the premise that homeopathy cannot work and that positive evidence reflects publication bias or design flaws until proved otherwise... We wonder whether any kind of evidence would persuade homeopathic physicians of their self-delusion and challenge them to design a methodologically sound trial, which if negative would finally persuade them to shut up shop... Homeopathy is based on an absurd concept that denies progress in physics and chemistry. Some 160 years after ''[[Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions]]'', an essay by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], we are still debating whether homeopathy is a placebo or not... Homeopathic principles are bold conjectures. There has been no spectacular corroboration of any of its founding principles... After more than 200 years, we are still waiting for homeopathy \"heretics\" to be proved right, during which time the advances in our understanding of disease, progress in therapeutics and surgery, and prolongation of the length and quality of life by so-called allopaths have been breathtaking. The true skeptic therefore takes pride in closed mindedness when presented with absurd assertions that contravene the laws of thermodynamics or deny progress in all branches of physics, chemistry, physiology, and medicine.<ref name=Baum_&_Ernst/></blockquote>\n\n==''More Harm Than Good?''==\nIn a review of ''More Harm Than Good? The Moral Maze of Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' doctor [[Harriet A. Hall|Harriet Hall]] calls Ernst the \"world's foremost expert on the claims and the evidence (or lack thereof) for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM).\" In this 2018 book by Springer Publishing, Ernst and co-author and medical ethicist, Kevin Smith take a different approach from ''Trick or Treatment'' which is to speak not to the \"practitioners and patients\" (of CAM) but to ethicists and the scientific community. \"It was written to inform, not to entertain. It is not a easy or 'fun' read, but it is an important one\". Hall writes that the authors have made the case that CAM \"exploits patients, including physical damage, mental distress, financial loss, and harm to third parties\". The authors have written out the most common excuses that CAM practitioners will make when \"confronted with evidence that their CAM modality is not as effective or safe as they claim\", then answered the top 10 with rebuttals.

These axioms [of homeopathy] are not only out of line with scientific facts but also directly opposed to them. If homeopathy is correct, much of physics, chemistry, and pharmacology must be incorrect.... To have an open mind about homeopathy or similarly implausible forms of alternative medicine (e.g., [[Bach flower remedies]], [[spiritual healing]], [[crystal therapy]]) is therefore not an option. We think that a belief in homeopathy exceeds the tolerance of an open mind. We should start from the premise that homeopathy cannot work and that positive evidence reflects publication bias or design flaws until proved otherwise... We wonder whether any kind of evidence would persuade homeopathic physicians of their self-delusion and challenge them to design a methodologically sound trial, which if negative would finally persuade them to shut up shop... Homeopathy is based on an absurd concept that denies progress in physics and chemistry. Some 160 years after ''[[Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions]]'', an essay by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], we are still debating whether homeopathy is a placebo or not... Homeopathic principles are bold conjectures. There has been no spectacular corroboration of any of its founding principles... After more than 200 years, we are still waiting for homeopathy \"heretics\" to be proved right, during which time the advances in our understanding of disease, progress in therapeutics and surgery, and prolongation of the length and quality of life by so-called allopaths have been breathtaking. The true skeptic therefore takes pride in closed mindedness when presented with absurd assertions that contravene the laws of thermodynamics or deny progress in all branches of physics, chemistry, physiology, and medicine.<ref name=Baum_&_Ernst/></blockquote>\n\n==''More Harm Than Good?''==\nIn a review of ''More Harm Than Good? The Moral Maze of Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' doctor [[Harriet A. Hall|Harriet Hall]] calls Ernst the \"world's foremost expert on the claims and the evidence (or lack thereof) for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM).\" In this 2018 book by Springer Publishing, Ernst and co-author and medical ethicist, Kevin Smith take a different approach from ''Trick or Treatment'' which is to speak not to the \"practitioners and patients\" (of CAM) but to ethicists and the scientific community. \"It was written to inform, not to entertain. It is not a easy or 'fun' read, but it is an important one\". Hall writes that the authors have made the case that CAM \"exploits patients, including physical damage, mental distress, financial loss, and harm to third parties\". The authors have written out the most common excuses that CAM practitioners will make when \"confronted with evidence that their CAM modality is not as effective or safe as they claim\", then answered the top 10 with rebuttals. The argument that CAM helps even as a placebo is addressed in full.<ref name=\"Hall 2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Harriet|authorlink=Harriet A.

However, operations actually began in 1871. By the end of the 19th century, it had expanded to [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[West Indies]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[North Africa]] and other international markets. During the next five decades, the company grew and prospered, surviving the difficulties of [[World War I]] and the large drain on its finances through policy claims arising from the large number of deaths caused by the [[Great Flu Epidemic]] of 1918.\n\nThe company's original [[Dominion Square]] building in Montreal was built in 1918. Capping a Montreal construction boom that began in the 1920s, the company completed construction of the expansion of its headquarters with its new 26-storey headquarters north tower in 1933. Although the [[Tour de la Banque Royale|head office of the Royal Bank of Canada on St. James Street]] was taller by several floors, the [[Sun Life Building]] was at the time the largest building in terms of square footage anywhere in the [[British Empire]].\n\nChartered in 1865, its traditional base business worldwide remains life insurance. However, it now also has significant asset management operations. In 1919, it was the first Canadian company to offer group life insurance. Having begun its first US operations in 1895, the company sold its first group life plan in the U.S. in 1924.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:One York, Toronto, South view 20170417 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sun Life Global Headquarters at One York Street in Toronto, Canada]]\nIn [[World War II]], the [[gold reserves]] and [[Security (finance)|securities]] of several European countries were secretly moved to the Sun Life Building for safekeeping. A persistent rumour that the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] were illegally shipped out of the United Kingdom during WWII and stored there was deliberately spread in Montreal to account for increased activity at the building.<ref name=\"Draper1979\">{{cite book|author=Alfred Draper|title=Operation Fish: The Race to Save Europe's Wealth, 1939\u20131945|url=https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Cassell|isbn=978-0-304-30068-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap/page/255 255]\u2013257}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nDuring the post-war period, the company's successful business strategies made it one of Montreal's largest white-collar employers, one of the top corporations in Canada, as well as a global player in the life insurance field. For the first half of the 20th century, the city of Montreal had been the economic hub of Canada, but it was losing ground to [[Toronto]]. As early as 1950, Toronto's economic activity surpassed Montreal's with regards to stock market trading and capitalization. The advent, in the 1960s, of political and [[terrorism|terrorist]] movements demanding the independence of Quebec from Canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community.\n\n===1977-1980===\nIn 1977, the newly elected [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] Quebec government passed the [[Charter of the French Language]] (known as Bill 101), making the use of [[French language]] mandatory for medium- and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. The law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. The new government also promised a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, injecting instability into the Montreal business community.<ref name=\"Guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/06/40-year-hangover-1976-olympic-games-broke-montreal-canada</ref> On January 6, 1978, Sun Life became the first large company to leave Quebec post-election, announcing that it would move its head office to rented space in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2011/03/21/la-financiere-sun-life-veut-repartir-a-zero-avec-le-quebec |title = La Financi\u00e8re Sun Life veut repartir \u00e0 z\u00e9ro avec le Qu\u00e9bec}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazette\">{{Cite web | url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/sun-life-now-remembers-yes-we-left-quebec-in-1978 |title = Sun Life Financial now remembers: Yes, we left Quebec in 1978 &#124; Montreal Gazette|date = 2012-02-09}}</ref> Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec's future, but skeptics said it was the company's unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101.<ref name=\"Gazette\"/> In a reaction the next day, the province's finance minister [[Jacques Parizeau]] called Sun Life \"one of the worst exporters of Quebec capital\",<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\">{{Cite web | url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2775856?docsearchtext=sun%20life%20levesque | title=BAnQ num\u00e9rique}}</ref> and threatened to freeze some $400 million CAD in assets.<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\"/><ref name=\"Mans1978\">{{cite book|author=Rowland Mans|title=Canada's Constitutional Crisis: Separatism and Subversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oM2IAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Institute for the Study of Conflict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the [[Sun Life Centre]], which was completed in 1984.<ref name=\"Filey1997\">{{cite book|author=Mike Filey|title=Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were|url=https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file|url-access=registration|date=1 October 1997|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-1330-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file/page/137 137]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBill 101 required more than French communications with French-speaking staff. It made French the official language of the workplace.

Connor, President and CEO of Sun Life, since 2011]]\nFor the largest employer of English-speaking people in Montreal, this would make things very difficult. Many, if not most, of Sun Life's Head Office employees in 1979 were not fluent in French. Sun Life was quite clear that this was the reason for its move when it made the announcement. The PQ government was quick to label Sun Life \"bad corporate citizens\" and claimed that if ''\"they had only warned us, we could have worked something out.\"''<ref name=CBC1>{{cite episode |title=CBC reports on Sun Life leaving Montreal in 1978 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/fighting-words-bill-101/sun-life-packs-up.html |accessdate=2014-08-18 |date=January 6, 1978 |series=The World At Six |credits=Reporters: Karen Birchard, Richard Inwood |work=[[CBC Radio]]}}</ref>\n\nThe downsizing of Sun Life's Montreal office did not take place overnight.

This included a decision by Sun Life to leave many markets, including China and India, because of economic and political changes. In 1962, Sun Life became a mutual company and repurchased its shares for $65 million in total. In 1973, Sun Life opened its American subsidiary's new headquarters in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, located outside [[Boston]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===1980s \u2013 1990s===\nSun Life continued to expand its wealth management business with the 1982 acquisition of [[MFS Investment Management|Massachusetts Financial Services]] (MFS), the Boston-based investment management and mutual fund company. It entered the mutual fund business in Canada by forming Spectrum Mutual Fund Services in 1987 (subsequently sold to CI Financial) and a decade later, acquired McLean Budden, a Canadian investment management firm (subsequently folded into MFS).\nInternational expansion continued in the 1990s. In 1995, Sun Life entered the Indonesia market through local company PT Asuransi Modern Sun Life, now called PT Sun Life Financial Indonesia and opened a Representative Office in Beijing in preparation to enter China. A year later, Sun Life opened a services centre in Waterford, Ireland, to provide technology and business processing support for Sun Life business units.\n\nIn 1999, Sun Life officially returned to [[India]] and [[China]] when it established two joint ventures \u2013 Birla Sun Life in India with local partner [[Aditya Birla Group]], and Sun Life Everbright in China with partner [[China Everbright Group]]. Over the next decade, both operations grew rapidly \u2013 by September 2008, there were 132,460 Birla Sun Life advisors working in 600 branches across India while Sun Life Everbright opened its sixth branch in Guangzhou, bringing its presence to 18 cities in [[China]].\n\n[[Image:Sun-Life-Building-June-2007.jpg|thumb|right|The Sun Life building in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]]]\n\n=== 2000's ===\nIn early 1998, Sun Life announced its intention to [[demutualize]]. In March 2000, its Initial Public Offering (IPO) started the trading of Sun Life Financial Inc. shares on the Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE) and Philippine (PSE) stock exchanges.\n\nIn 2002, Sun Life combined its operations with [[Clarica Life Insurance]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Founded in 1870 as ''Mutual Life of Canada'', Clarica was known as The Mutual Group before it went public in 1999. The former head office for Mutual Life Assurance Company at 227 King Street South in Waterloo became the home to Sun Life's Canadian operations, while a regional office and Sun Life's corporate headquarters remained in Toronto. The company also maintains regional offices in [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Calgary]]. After it integrated operations, the company used the Clarica brand name for certain products and activities until 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Life opened a service centre in Gurgaon, [[India]] to provide business processing and technology support for Sun Life Financial business units around the world. That same year, Sun Life purchased CMG Asia and CommServe Financial, the Hong Kong insurance and pension operations of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, tripling its customer base and adding group insurance and pensions to its business lines.\n\nIn 2007, Sun Life purchased the U.S. employee benefits business of Genworth Financial, placing itself in the top 10 in the U.S. group benefits market.\n\nIn 2008, Sun Life sold its 37% interest in CI Financial Income Fund to [[Scotiabank]].

CIMB retains 2% interest.\n\nIn 2015, Sun Life acquired the Employee Benefits business of Assurant Inc. The transaction closed in March 2016, creating the sixth-largest group benefits business in the U.S.\n\nIn 2017, the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] announced that Sun Life will become their jersey sponsor beginning with the 2017-18 NBA season.

However, operations actually began in 1871. By the end of the 19th century, it had expanded to [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[West Indies]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[North Africa]] and other international markets. During the next five decades, the company grew and prospered, surviving the difficulties of [[World War I]] and the large drain on its finances through policy claims arising from the large number of deaths caused by the [[Great Flu Epidemic]] of 1918.\n\nThe company's original [[Dominion Square]] building in Montreal was built in 1918. Capping a Montreal construction boom that began in the 1920s, the company completed construction of the expansion of its headquarters with its new 26-storey headquarters north tower in 1933. Although the [[Tour de la Banque Royale|head office of the Royal Bank of Canada on St. James Street]] was taller by several floors, the [[Sun Life Building]] was at the time the largest building in terms of square footage anywhere in the [[British Empire]].\n\nChartered in 1865, its traditional base business worldwide remains life insurance. However, it now also has significant asset management operations. In 1919, it was the first Canadian company to offer group life insurance. Having begun its first US operations in 1895, the company sold its first group life plan in the U.S. in 1924.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:One York, Toronto, South view 20170417 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sun Life Global Headquarters at One York Street in Toronto, Canada]]\nIn [[World War II]], the [[gold reserves]] and [[Security (finance)|securities]] of several European countries were secretly moved to the Sun Life Building for safekeeping.

The law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. The new government also promised a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, injecting instability into the Montreal business community.<ref name=\"Guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/06/40-year-hangover-1976-olympic-games-broke-montreal-canada</ref> On January 6, 1978, Sun Life became the first large company to leave Quebec post-election, announcing that it would move its head office to rented space in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2011/03/21/la-financiere-sun-life-veut-repartir-a-zero-avec-le-quebec |title = La Financi\u00e8re Sun Life veut repartir \u00e0 z\u00e9ro avec le Qu\u00e9bec}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazette\">{{Cite web | url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/sun-life-now-remembers-yes-we-left-quebec-in-1978 |title = Sun Life Financial now remembers: Yes, we left Quebec in 1978 &#124; Montreal Gazette|date = 2012-02-09}}</ref> Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec's future, but skeptics said it was the company's unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101.<ref name=\"Gazette\"/> In a reaction the next day, the province's finance minister [[Jacques Parizeau]] called Sun Life \"one of the worst exporters of Quebec capital\",<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\">{{Cite web | url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2775856?docsearchtext=sun%20life%20levesque | title=BAnQ num\u00e9rique}}</ref> and threatened to freeze some $400 million CAD in assets.<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\"/><ref name=\"Mans1978\">{{cite book|author=Rowland Mans|title=Canada's Constitutional Crisis: Separatism and Subversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oM2IAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Institute for the Study of Conflict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the [[Sun Life Centre]], which was completed in 1984.<ref name=\"Filey1997\">{{cite book|author=Mike Filey|title=Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were|url=https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file|url-access=registration|date=1 October 1997|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-1330-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file/page/137 137]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBill 101 required more than French communications with French-speaking staff. It made French the official language of the workplace. It also provided that present and prospective employees who could not speak English not be discriminated against because of their inability to speak English.\n[[File:Dean A Connor Headshot.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dean A. Connor, President and CEO of Sun Life, since 2011]]\nFor the largest employer of English-speaking people in Montreal, this would make things very difficult. Many, if not most, of Sun Life's Head Office employees in 1979 were not fluent in French. Sun Life was quite clear that this was the reason for its move when it made the announcement. The PQ government was quick to label Sun Life \"bad corporate citizens\" and claimed that if ''\"they had only warned us, we could have worked something out.\"''<ref name=CBC1>{{cite episode |title=CBC reports on Sun Life leaving Montreal in 1978 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/fighting-words-bill-101/sun-life-packs-up.html |accessdate=2014-08-18 |date=January 6, 1978 |series=The World At Six |credits=Reporters: Karen Birchard, Richard Inwood |work=[[CBC Radio]]}}</ref>\n\nThe downsizing of Sun Life's Montreal office did not take place overnight. Transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement. By 1980, 300 head office employees were located in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1076086/sun-life-demenagement-montreal-toronto-pq-archives |title = Il y a 40 ans : Le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement surprise de la Sun Life}}</ref>\n\nThere were several other key activities in the post-war years. This included a decision by Sun Life to leave many markets, including China and India, because of economic and political changes. In 1962, Sun Life became a mutual company and repurchased its shares for $65 million in total. In 1973, Sun Life opened its American subsidiary's new headquarters in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, located outside [[Boston]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===1980s \u2013 1990s===\nSun Life continued to expand its wealth management business with the 1982 acquisition of [[MFS Investment Management|Massachusetts Financial Services]] (MFS), the Boston-based investment management and mutual fund company. It entered the mutual fund business in Canada by forming Spectrum Mutual Fund Services in 1987 (subsequently sold to CI Financial) and a decade later, acquired McLean Budden, a Canadian investment management firm (subsequently folded into MFS).\nInternational expansion continued in the 1990s. In 1995, Sun Life entered the Indonesia market through local company PT Asuransi Modern Sun Life, now called PT Sun Life Financial Indonesia and opened a Representative Office in Beijing in preparation to enter China. A year later, Sun Life opened a services centre in Waterford, Ireland, to provide technology and business processing support for Sun Life business units.\n\nIn 1999, Sun Life officially returned to [[India]] and [[China]] when it established two joint ventures \u2013 Birla Sun Life in India with local partner [[Aditya Birla Group]], and Sun Life Everbright in China with partner [[China Everbright Group]]. Over the next decade, both operations grew rapidly \u2013 by September 2008, there were 132,460 Birla Sun Life advisors working in 600 branches across India while Sun Life Everbright opened its sixth branch in Guangzhou, bringing its presence to 18 cities in [[China]].\n\n[[Image:Sun-Life-Building-June-2007.jpg|thumb|right|The Sun Life building in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]]]\n\n=== 2000's ===\nIn early 1998, Sun Life announced its intention to [[demutualize]]. In March 2000, its Initial Public Offering (IPO) started the trading of Sun Life Financial Inc. shares on the Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE) and Philippine (PSE) stock exchanges.\n\nIn 2002, Sun Life combined its operations with [[Clarica Life Insurance]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Founded in 1870 as ''Mutual Life of Canada'', Clarica was known as The Mutual Group before it went public in 1999. The former head office for Mutual Life Assurance Company at 227 King Street South in Waterloo became the home to Sun Life's Canadian operations, while a regional office and Sun Life's corporate headquarters remained in Toronto. The company also maintains regional offices in [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Calgary]]. After it integrated operations, the company used the Clarica brand name for certain products and activities until 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Life opened a service centre in Gurgaon, [[India]] to provide business processing and technology support for Sun Life Financial business units around the world. That same year, Sun Life purchased CMG Asia and CommServe Financial, the Hong Kong insurance and pension operations of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, tripling its customer base and adding group insurance and pensions to its business lines.\n\nIn 2007, Sun Life purchased the U.S. employee benefits business of Genworth Financial, placing itself in the top 10 in the U.S. group benefits market.\n\nIn 2008, Sun Life sold its 37% interest in CI Financial Income Fund to [[Scotiabank]]. Sun Life had originally acquired a significant [[ownership interest]] in the firm by selling its Canadian mutual fund subsidiaries to CI Financial in 2002.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/05/22/cifund020522.html |title= CBC News - CI Fund acquires Sun Life mutual fund business |accessdate=2008-12-28 |date=22 May 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sun Life began an aggressive nationwide ad campaign in the [[United States]] touting its strength and the fact that it did not accept any [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|bailout]] money.\n\n=== 2010's ===\nIn 2013, Sun Life acquired 49% [[Aviva|Aviva PLC's]] Malaysian insurance joint venture with lender [[CIMB Group]]. Sun Life acquired the business along with Malaysian state investor [[Khazanah Nasional]], which also purchased 49%. They each paid approximately CDN$300 million. CIMB retains 2% interest.\n\nIn 2015, Sun Life acquired the Employee Benefits business of Assurant Inc. The transaction closed in March 2016, creating the sixth-largest group benefits business in the U.S.\n\nIn 2017, the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] announced that Sun Life will become their jersey sponsor beginning with the 2017-18 NBA season. This deal continues through the 2019/2020 season.\n\nIn June 2019, Sun Life re-branded its Sun Life Investment Management unit to SLC Management and fully merged its fixed income businesses, Ryan Labs Asset Management Inc. and Prime Advisors, Inc. with Sun Life Capital Management (U.S.)\n\nIn addition, in July 2019, SLC's real estate division was merged under the name BentallGreenOak Real Estate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://insurance-journal.ca/article/sun-life-completes-bentallgreenoaks-acquisition/|title=Sun Life completes BentallGreenOaks acquisition|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Sun Life in North America ==\n\n=== Canada ===\nSun Life's Canadian headquarters are based out of the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo]], [[Ontario]].\n\nSun Life contributes to the local economy as one of the top 5 major employers in the region, with approximately 3,500 employees \u2014 more than 40% of Sun Life's employee base in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canadastop100.com/waterloo/|title=Waterloo Top|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSun Life is an Observing Organization in the Regional Carbon Initiative (run by the Sustainable Waterloo Region) and a member of TravelWise, a joint program of Sustainable Waterloo Region and the Region of Waterloo.\n\nSun Life roots in Canada go back over 150 years and is estimated that the company provides financial products and advice to 1 in 5 Canadians.\n\nIn 2012, Sun Life celebrated the 100th anniversary of its Canadian head office building, located on King Street, right on the border of the Cities of Kitchener and Waterloo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunlife.ca/ca/About+us/Newsroom/Canadian+head+office?vgnLocale=en_CA|title=Canadian head office|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== United States of America ===\nSun Life's U.S. Headquarters are based out of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], a [[New England town|town]] in [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], [[Massachusetts]] and considered a part of [[Greater Boston]].\n\nSun Life Financial U.S. has the sixth-largest group benefits business in the United States and serves more than 60,000 employers in small, medium and large workplaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.sunlife.com/static/Unitedstates/Updates/Assurant_Employee_Benefits_Acquisition/Sun_Life_Financial_U.S._Group_Benefits_Fact_Sheet_8.1.16.pdf|title=Sun Life Financial U.S. \u2013 Group Benefits key facts and figures|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSun Life\u2019s portfolio of insurance products and services in the U.S. includes disability, absence management, life, dental, vision, voluntary and medical stop-loss.\n\nIn 2018, Sun Life Financial U.S. was named one of the Top Places to Work in Massachusetts for 2018 by ''The Boston Globe''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/specials/top-places-to-work/2018/11/15/greater-boston-top-largest-employers/EUZk8XwaVOGr7XcE9UvMpJ/story.html?event=event12|title=Greater Boston Top Employers|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Sun Life Asset Management ==\nSun Life\u2019s asset management operation includes subsidiaries:\n\n* MFS Investment Management, which serves individual and institutional investors around the world;\n* SLC Management, which provides investment solutions{{Buzzword inline|date=August 2019}} for defined benefit pension plans, insurance companies and other institutional investors globally.

The bridge is located approximately {{convert|156|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]] as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and was built in 1869 by contractor, P. Higgins. It is also known as '''Lithgow (James St) Underbridge'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 30 August 2013.<ref name=nswshr-1831>{{cite NSW SHR|5061199|Lithgow (James St) Underbridge|hr=01831|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Main West Railway Line runs from [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] to [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] and was completed in 1885. By 1900 certain sections of John Whitton's single track railway network were operating at or near saturation, these included the famous [[Lithgow Zig Zag|Zig Zag near Lithgow]], the Main West from [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] right through to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], the Main South from [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]] as far as [[Harden, New South Wales|Harden]] and the Main North between [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] and [[Muswellbrook, New South Wales|Muswellbrook]]. Also, the metropolitan railways were congested by the combination of suburban and freight traffic. The Line was duplicated through Lithgow to [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]] in 1891 and then onto [[Wallerawang]] in 1922.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\nJohn Whitton chose to use stone arch construction when denied sufficient funds to use imported wrought iron girders. It is the second oldest railway arch bridge in New South Wales built for two tracks.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\nThe James Street railway bridge was built in 1869 as part of the Lithgow to Bathurst railway extension, which was completed in 1875. Economic constraints forced Whitton to build the others on this line for single track. They were progressively bypassed by double track brick arch bridges but the bridge at James Street continues its original function.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n== Description ==\nThree [[Span (architecture)|span]], double track, [[sandstone]] arch railway bridge with {{convert|20|ft|m|order=flip}} clear central span between solid stone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and abutments, with a low stone [[parapet]]. The arches are half circles in elevation with sandstone [[Impost (architecture)|imposts]] at the junction of the arches and piers.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 19 October 2009, the bridge is in moderate condition with the following defects: several cracks and erosion in the stone arches, and parapets out-of-line with missing mortar. Vegetation growing on south facing wall.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\nThe James St Underbridge is of high integrity, retaining its original fabric in a good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nAnchors in [[spandrel]] walls added. Concrete [[retaining wall]] adjacent.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 9 October 2009, the James St Underbridge is significant as the second oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales still in use. The bridge was designed by John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief for the railways between 1856 and 1890, and is one of the only Whitton designed bridges remaining in use on the Main West Line. John Whitton has been described as the \"Father of New South Wales Railways\", responsible for the establishment of the basic framework of the NSW rail network.

The bridge is located approximately {{convert|156|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]] as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and was built in 1869 by contractor, P. Higgins. It is also known as '''Lithgow (James St) Underbridge'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 30 August 2013.<ref name=nswshr-1831>{{cite NSW SHR|5061199|Lithgow (James St) Underbridge|hr=01831|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Main West Railway Line runs from [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] to [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] and was completed in 1885. By 1900 certain sections of John Whitton's single track railway network were operating at or near saturation, these included the famous [[Lithgow Zig Zag|Zig Zag near Lithgow]], the Main West from [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] right through to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], the Main South from [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]] as far as [[Harden, New South Wales|Harden]] and the Main North between [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] and [[Muswellbrook, New South Wales|Muswellbrook]]. Also, the metropolitan railways were congested by the combination of suburban and freight traffic. The Line was duplicated through Lithgow to [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]] in 1891 and then onto [[Wallerawang]] in 1922.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\nJohn Whitton chose to use stone arch construction when denied sufficient funds to use imported wrought iron girders. It is the second oldest railway arch bridge in New South Wales built for two tracks.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\nThe James Street railway bridge was built in 1869 as part of the Lithgow to Bathurst railway extension, which was completed in 1875. Economic constraints forced Whitton to build the others on this line for single track. They were progressively bypassed by double track brick arch bridges but the bridge at James Street continues its original function.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n== Description ==\nThree [[Span (architecture)|span]], double track, [[sandstone]] arch railway bridge with {{convert|20|ft|m|order=flip}} clear central span between solid stone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and abutments, with a low stone [[parapet]]. The arches are half circles in elevation with sandstone [[Impost (architecture)|imposts]] at the junction of the arches and piers.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 19 October 2009, the bridge is in moderate condition with the following defects: several cracks and erosion in the stone arches, and parapets out-of-line with missing mortar. Vegetation growing on south facing wall.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\nThe James St Underbridge is of high integrity, retaining its original fabric in a good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nAnchors in [[spandrel]] walls added. Concrete [[retaining wall]] adjacent.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 9 October 2009, the James St Underbridge is significant as the second oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales still in use. The bridge was designed by John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief for the railways between 1856 and 1890, and is one of the only Whitton designed bridges remaining in use on the Main West Line. John Whitton has been described as the \"Father of New South Wales Railways\", responsible for the establishment of the basic framework of the NSW rail network. The bridge forms part of the larger historic Lithgow railway corridor, and exemplifies the style and technique used in construction of stone arch bridges, a form of construction which is relatively rare within the NSW rail network.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\nLithgow Underbridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 30 August 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe James St Underbridge has historical significance as the second oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales still in use, and as one of the only original Whitton Era bridges still in use along the Main West Line.<ref name=nswshr-1831/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe James St Underbridge has associative significance as it was designed by John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief for Railways between 1856 and 1890.
