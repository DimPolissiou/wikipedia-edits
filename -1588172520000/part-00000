The SRU is headed by the President (Dee Bradbury) and Chairman (Colin Grassie), with Mark Dodson acting as the Chief Executive Officer. Bradbury became the first female president of a Tier 1 rugby nation upon her appointment on 4 August 2018.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of rugby union in Scotland}}\n\n===1873 \u2014 1920s===\nThe Scottish Football Union was founded on Monday 3 March 1873 at a meeting held at [[Glasgow Academy]], Elmbank Street, Glasgow. Eight clubs were represented at the foundation, [[Glasgow Academicals RFC|Glasgow Academicals]]; [[Edinburgh Academical Football Club]]; [[West of Scotland F.C.]]; [[University of St Andrews Rugby Football Club]]; [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)#Sports and games|Royal High School FP]]; [[Merchistonian FC|Merchistonians]]; [[Edinburgh University RFC]]; and [[Glasgow University Rugby Football Club|Glasgow University]]. Five of these clubs were, at the time of founding the Scottish Football Union, already members of the previously instituted [[Rugby Football Union]]. Although the RFU now represents exclusively English clubs, in its first few years it had members from outside England, there being no other national union. West of Scotland, Glasgow Academicals and [[Edinburgh University RFC|Edinburgh University]] had joined the RFU in 1871 and Edinburgh Academicals and Royal High School FP had joined in 1872. These five renounced membership of the RFU to join the SFU.\n\nThe SFU was a founding member of the International Rugby Football Board, now known as [[World Rugby]], in 1886 with [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]] and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]]. (England refused to join until 1890.)\n\nIn 1924 the SFU changed its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union.<ref name=\"1925GS\">{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0020/print.shtml |title=First Scottish Grand Slam |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-10-27 |last=MacDonald |first=Paul}}</ref> International games were played at [[Inverleith]] from 1899 to 1925 when Murrayfield was opened.\n\n===1990s \u2014 present===\nThe SRU owns [[Murrayfield Stadium]] which is the main home ground of the [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scottish national team]], though in 2004 international rugby games were played at [[Hampden Park]] in [[Glasgow]] and [[McDiarmid Park]] in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], as part of the SRU's campaign to reach out to new audiences outside the traditional rugby areas.\n\nWhen the [[Heineken Cup]] (now replaced by the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]]) was suggested SRU officials were concerned that Scottish club sides could not compete against the best teams from France and England and that centrally funded so-called 'super-district' teams might do better.\n\nThe four traditional districts\u2014the South (renamed [[Border Reivers (rugby union)|Border Reivers]]), Edinburgh, Glasgow and the North & Midlands (rebranded as [[Caledonia Reds]])\u2014were given the go-ahead to take part in Europe. For the first two seasons, players were still released to play for their clubs in domestic competition, but eventually the districts became full-time operations.\n\nThen financial difficulties \u2013 the SRU's high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] \u2013 called for retrenchment. After two seasons, financial difficulties forced the SRU to merge the four teams into two. Edinburgh merged with the Border Reivers to form a team to be known as Edinburgh Reivers. Glasgow merged with Caledonian to form a team to be known as Glasgow Caledonian.\n\n[[Border Reivers (rugby)|The Borders]] was resurrected in 2002 and joined the second season of the [[Pro14|Celtic League]]. As a consequence Edinburgh Reivers became simply [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and Glasgow became Glasgow Rugby.<ref name=AnnRep2003>{{cite web| url=http://www.scottishrugby.org/pdfs/SRU_AnnualReport.pdf |title=SRU Annual Report 2003-04|publisher=Scottish Rugby Union |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050120183950/http://www.scottishrugby.org/pdfs/SRU_AnnualReport.pdf |archivedate=20 January 2005}}</ref> In 2005, all three teams adopted new names. The Borders readopted the name Border Reivers; Edinburgh became Edinburgh Gunners, but would revert to Edinburgh in 2006; and Glasgow became [[Glasgow Warriors]]. Furthermore, the SRU planned to have a world class rugby side for each city or large town in Scotland, when financial circumstances permitted.<ref name=dictators>{{cite news| url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/rugby.cfm?id=51502005 |title= SRU accused of becoming dictatorship |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=15 January 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, The Borders team was disbanded yet again as a result of continuing financial difficulties. In the same year, the SRU began organising the [[Scotland Sevens]], first held in Edinburgh and later in Glasgow. For several years, it was the final event in the annual [[IRB Sevens World Series|Sevens World Series]], but that distinction now belongs to [[London Sevens|London]].\n\nOn 21 November 2009 Scotland beat Australia 9\u20138 after 17 attempts in 27 years.\n\nIn the Season 2010\u201311 the SRU had a contractual dispute with the Season Ticket Holders of Edinburgh Rugby.\n\nOn 22 December 2010 at Edinburgh Sheriff Court (Small Claims) the Sheriff ruled the Scottish Rugby Union had entered a contract between itself and Season Ticket Holders of Edinburgh Rugby Club. The Sheriff also found that the SRU had breached the contract between itself and Edinburgh Rugby Club (a Division of the SRU). Although it was found that the SRU had breached the contract, the Sheriff could not make an order instructing the SRU to comply with its obligation under that contract.\n\n===Centenary celebrations===\nThe SRU celebrated its centenary in 1973 with a number of events. Among these was the [[1973 International Seven-A-Side Tournament]], the first sevens tournament to have national representative sides. The programme for that event also sported the new coat of arms of the SRU that was granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] on 28 February 1973, for the centenary season.

The SRU is headed by the President (Dee Bradbury) and Chairman (Colin Grassie), with Mark Dodson acting as the Chief Executive Officer. Bradbury became the first female president of a Tier 1 rugby nation upon her appointment on 4 August 2018.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of rugby union in Scotland}}\n\n===1873 \u2014 1920s===\nThe Scottish Football Union was founded on Monday 3 March 1873 at a meeting held at [[Glasgow Academy]], Elmbank Street, Glasgow. Eight clubs were represented at the foundation, [[Glasgow Academicals RFC|Glasgow Academicals]]; [[Edinburgh Academical Football Club]]; [[West of Scotland F.C.]]; [[University of St Andrews Rugby Football Club]]; [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)#Sports and games|Royal High School FP]]; [[Merchistonian FC|Merchistonians]]; [[Edinburgh University RFC]]; and [[Glasgow University Rugby Football Club|Glasgow University]]. Five of these clubs were, at the time of founding the Scottish Football Union, already members of the previously instituted [[Rugby Football Union]]. Although the RFU now represents exclusively English clubs, in its first few years it had members from outside England, there being no other national union. West of Scotland, Glasgow Academicals and [[Edinburgh University RFC|Edinburgh University]] had joined the RFU in 1871 and Edinburgh Academicals and Royal High School FP had joined in 1872. These five renounced membership of the RFU to join the SFU.\n\nThe SFU was a founding member of the International Rugby Football Board, now known as [[World Rugby]], in 1886 with [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]] and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]]. (England refused to join until 1890.)\n\nIn 1924 the SFU changed its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union.<ref name=\"1925GS\">{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0020/print.shtml |title=First Scottish Grand Slam |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-10-27 |last=MacDonald |first=Paul}}</ref> International games were played at [[Inverleith]] from 1899 to 1925 when Murrayfield was opened.\n\n===1990s \u2014 present===\nThe SRU owns [[Murrayfield Stadium]] which is the main home ground of the [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scottish national team]], though in 2004 international rugby games were played at [[Hampden Park]] in [[Glasgow]] and [[McDiarmid Park]] in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], as part of the SRU's campaign to reach out to new audiences outside the traditional rugby areas.\n\nWhen the [[Heineken Cup]] (now replaced by the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]]) was suggested SRU officials were concerned that Scottish club sides could not compete against the best teams from France and England and that centrally funded so-called 'super-district' teams might do better.\n\nThe four traditional districts\u2014the South (renamed [[Border Reivers]]), Edinburgh, Glasgow and the North & Midlands (rebranded as [[Caledonia Reds]])\u2014were given the go-ahead to take part in Europe. For the first two seasons, players were still released to play for their clubs in domestic competition, but eventually the districts became full-time operations.\n\nThen financial difficulties \u2013 the SRU's high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] \u2013 called for retrenchment. After two seasons, financial difficulties forced the SRU to merge the four teams into two. Edinburgh merged with the Border Reivers to form a team to be known as Edinburgh Reivers. Glasgow merged with Caledonian to form a team to be known as Glasgow Caledonian.\n\n[[Border Reivers (rugby)|The Borders]] was resurrected in 2002 and joined the second season of the [[Pro14|Celtic League]]. As a consequence Edinburgh Reivers became simply [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and Glasgow became Glasgow Rugby.<ref name=AnnRep2003>{{cite web| url=http://www.scottishrugby.org/pdfs/SRU_AnnualReport.pdf |title=SRU Annual Report 2003-04|publisher=Scottish Rugby Union |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050120183950/http://www.scottishrugby.org/pdfs/SRU_AnnualReport.pdf |archivedate=20 January 2005}}</ref> In 2005, all three teams adopted new names. The Borders readopted the name Border Reivers; Edinburgh became Edinburgh Gunners, but would revert to Edinburgh in 2006; and Glasgow became [[Glasgow Warriors]]. Furthermore, the SRU planned to have a world class rugby side for each city or large town in Scotland, when financial circumstances permitted.<ref name=dictators>{{cite news| url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/rugby.cfm?id=51502005 |title= SRU accused of becoming dictatorship |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=15 January 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, The Borders team was disbanded yet again as a result of continuing financial difficulties. In the same year, the SRU began organising the [[Scotland Sevens]], first held in Edinburgh and later in Glasgow. For several years, it was the final event in the annual [[IRB Sevens World Series|Sevens World Series]], but that distinction now belongs to [[London Sevens|London]].\n\nOn 21 November 2009 Scotland beat Australia 9\u20138 after 17 attempts in 27 years.\n\nIn the Season 2010\u201311 the SRU had a contractual dispute with the Season Ticket Holders of Edinburgh Rugby.\n\nOn 22 December 2010 at Edinburgh Sheriff Court (Small Claims) the Sheriff ruled the Scottish Rugby Union had entered a contract between itself and Season Ticket Holders of Edinburgh Rugby Club. The Sheriff also found that the SRU had breached the contract between itself and Edinburgh Rugby Club (a Division of the SRU). Although it was found that the SRU had breached the contract, the Sheriff could not make an order instructing the SRU to comply with its obligation under that contract.\n\n===Centenary celebrations===\nThe SRU celebrated its centenary in 1973 with a number of events. Among these was the [[1973 International Seven-A-Side Tournament]], the first sevens tournament to have national representative sides. The programme for that event also sported the new coat of arms of the SRU that was granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] on 28 February 1973, for the centenary season. The coat of arms is still in use today, but in the main the SRU use the commercial thistle logo on jerseys and stationary. The coat of arms has the motto ''\"Non Sine Gloria\"'', meaning ''\"Not Without Glory\"''.\n\n==Domestic Rugby==\n{{see also|Scottish rugby union system|Rugby union in Scotland}}\n\nThe SRU oversees the national league system, known as the [[Scottish League Championship]], and consisting of:\n* a [[Scottish Premiership (rugby)|Premiership]] of 20 teams across 2 divisions.\n* a [[Scottish Championship Leagues|National Leagues]] of 20 teams across 2 regional divisions.\n* [[Scottish Regional Leagues|Regional Leagues]] of 150 clubs in 18 divisions across three regions\n\nIt also oversees the [[Scottish Cup (rugby union)|Scottish Cup]].
