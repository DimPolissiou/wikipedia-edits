A main strategist of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], he was wounded at the [[Battle of Waterloo]].\n\n==Military career==\nCambronne was born in [[Nantes]] ([[Loire-Atlantique]]). He joined the [[Grenadier]]s as a volunteer in 1792, serving under [[Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez]] in [[Belgium]], in the [[Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e|Vend\u00e9e]], took part in the [[Invasion of France (1795)|battle of Quiberon]], then in the [[Exp\u00e9dition d'Irlande|expedition to Ireland]] under [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] in 1796. He then joined the [[Army of the Alps]] under [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], where he was promoted to command of a grenadier company at the [[Second Battle of Z\u00fcrich|Battle of Zurich]] (1799).\n\nIn 1800, he commanded a company under [[Th\u00e9ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne|Latour d'Auvergne]], and later succeeded him as First Grenadier of France. He was made a [[Colonel]] at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Battle of Jena]] in 1806, given command of the 3rd Regiment of the [[Voltigeurs]] of the Guard in 1810, and was made a [[Baron]] the same year. (''Voltigeur'', a French word meaning ''vaulter'' or ''leaper'', was a designation given to elite [[light infantry]] units in the French Army, who acted as advance units of the main column.)\n\nCambronne then fought in [[Peninsular War|Spain]], then joined [[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]. In [[Russia]] he commanded the 3rd Regiment of Voltigeurs of the Guard, and took part in the battles of [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]], [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]], and [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], before being promoted to [[G\u00e9n\u00e9ral|General]].\n\n==The hundred days and Waterloo==\n[[File:NAPOLEON General Cambronne Aquatinta 1823-9.jpg|thumb|Popular image of the 1820s illustrating the deeds of General Cambronne]]\nHe became [[major]] of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] in 1814, and accompanied [[Napoleon I of France|Napol\u00e9on]] into exile to the island of [[Elba]], where he was a military commander. He then returned with Napol\u00e9on to France on 1 March 1815 for [[the Hundred Days]], capturing the fortress of [[Sisteron]] (5 March), and was made a [[Count]] by Napol\u00e9on when they arrived at [[Paris]]. Cambronne was seriously wounded at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and was taken prisoner by the British.\n\nThe exact circumstances of his surrender to the British are disputed. At the battle's conclusion, Cambronne was commanding the last of the [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]] when [[Charles Colville|General Colville]] called on him to surrender. According to a journalist named Rougement, Cambronne replied: \"''La garde meurt mais ne se rend pas&nbsp;!''\" (\"The Guard dies but does not surrender!\").

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes).

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref>\n\nMany modern commentators and even translators have come to associate him with [[Xerxes I]], taking a lead from the [[Book of Esther]].\n\nBut others have come to question this and make an identification with [[Cambyses II]]<ref>Gill's Exposition of the Whole Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref> or with [[Bardiya|False Smerdis / Bardiya / Gomoates]] who reigned for seven months between [[Cambyses II]] and [[Darius I]].<ref>Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, others argue that Ezra's usage can ''only'' be [[Cambyses II]]: forced by \"Ahasuerus\" appearing between the very identifiable kings of [[Cyrus]] and [[Darius I|Darius the Persian]].<ref>Jones, A.T., Great Empires of Prophecy, 5.10, footnote</ref> arguing that: 1.

[[Cyaxares II|Cyaxares]] then offered Cyrus his daughter's hand in marriage and the kingdom of Media as the dowry which was likewise accepted.<ref>Xenophon, Cyropedia 7.5.17-20</ref>\n* The general belief that the [[Book of Daniel]] is reliable in matters of history.\n\nIf these sources are held as at least relatively credible in the major points, then the common conclusion is that [[Darius the Mede]] is [[Cyaxares II]].  This position is internally consistent with Daniel's claim <ref>{{bibleref|Daniel|5:31}}</ref> that Darius the Mede took the kingdom of Babylon while also seemingly interchangeably to hold that it was Cyrus, King of Persia and leader of the allied forces<ref>White, E.G., Prophets and Kings, p.523, 556,557</ref> who took the kingdom in ''The Book of Daniel''.<ref>Benson Commentary, https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/9.htm</ref><ref>Barnes' Notes, https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm</ref>  These thoughts undoubtedly have lead some to conclude that \"Ahasuerus\" here in Daniel 9:1 is Astyages;<ref>Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary, https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm</ref><ref>Geneva Study Bible, https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/9.htm</ref>  ''Gill's Exposition'' calls the [[Book of Tobit]] to his aid on this point.<ref>Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/9.htm</ref>  Yet some commentators, building on these thoughts (as below) progress further to argue for [[Cyaxares|Cyaxares I]]\n\n==== Arguments for Cyaxares I ====\n* Contemporaneous Hebrew usage of the word \"son\" can extend to \"grandson\"\n* Linguistic usage of \"Ahasuerus\" (as stated above) carries connotations of [[Cyaxares|Cyaxares I]] but not [[Astyages]].<ref> Nichol, F.D., Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 4, Review and Herald Publishing Association, (Washington, D.C., 1954 edition), p.817, \"Additional Note on Chapter 6\", point 4, par.5</ref>\n\nThis simple position allows for [[Darius the Mede]] to still be [[Cyaxares II]] (as discussed above) regardless of the finer historical details and literary licenses, while also allowing \"Ahasuerus\" to be linguistically [[Cyaxares|Cyaxares I]].  This is the summary position position of the Seventh-day Adventist Church's Bible Commentaries.<ref> Nichol, F.D., Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 4, Review and Herald Publishing Association, (Washington, D.C., 1954 edition), p.817, \"Additional Note on Chapter 6\", last line</ref>\n\n==== Arguments for Xerxes I ====\nNot unlike the arguments for [[Cyaxares|Cyaxares I]], ''The Pulpit Commentary'' recognizing the linguistic connection above with that of Xerxes and promptly builds a case for Darius (the Persian), son of [[Xerxes I|Xerxes the Great]] as \"Ahasuerus\" in the [[Book of Daniel]].<ref>Pulpit Commentary, https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm</ref>\n\n==== Arguments for Other Characters ====\nWhile debate exists for characters such as [[Cambyses II]] and the generals and or governors Gobryas, Ugbaru & Gubaru as being Darius the Mede,<ref> Nichol, F.D., Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 4, Review and Herald Publishing Association, (Washington, D.C., 1954 edition), p.815, \"Additional Note on Chapter 6\", point 3</ref> these positions are irrelevant to the subject of this page being: \"Ahasuerus\" in the \"Book of Daniel\".  For Cambyses II's father [[Cyrus]] seemingly never donned the title of \"Ahasuerus\" and the the others never donned a title higher than 'General' or 'Governor'.\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907). Assuerus. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved April 15, 2009 from ''New Advent'']</ref> In the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] Greek ([[LXX]]) edition, the two names in this verse appear instead as one name, [[Ahikar]] (also the name of another character in the story of Tobit). Other Septuagint texts have the name ''Achiachar''.  Western scholars have proposed that ''Achiachar'' is a variant form of the name \"[[Cyaxares|Cyaxares I]] of [[Medes|Media]]\", who historically did destroy Nineveh, in 612 BC.\n\n==In legends==\nIn some versions of the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]], his true name is held to be Ahasuerus.<ref>Andrei Oi\u015fteanu, {{cite web |url=http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/filologie/hebra/2-5.htm |title=The legend of the wandering Jew in Europe and Romania. |accessdate=2008-03-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203154217/http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/filologie/hebra/2-5.htm |archivedate=2008-02-03 |url-status=dead }} Studia Hebraica.</ref> This is the name by which [[Immanuel Kant]] refers to the Wandering Jew in ''[[The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God]]''.<ref>Kant, I.
