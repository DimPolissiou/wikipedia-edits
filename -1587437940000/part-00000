I too struggle to define it.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Fader]]'', Rowsell stated that she wanted to write a love song,  but was \"not going to hold back and make it discreet.

I too struggle to define it.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Fader]]'', Rowsell stated that she wanted to write a love song,  but was \"not going to hold back and make it discreet.

Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called \"[[trivial names]]\" e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix ''-oate''. For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl [[Caprylic acid|caprylate]], has the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n[[Image:EtOAcImp.png|thumb|Ethyl acetate derived from an alcohol (blue) and an [[acyl]] group (yellow) derived from a carboxylic acid]]\n\nThe chemical formulas of organic esters usually take the form RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 are the hydrocarbon parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively. For example, [[butyl acetate]] (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from [[n-Butanol|butanol]] and [[acetic acid]] (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>. Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>.\n\nCyclic esters are called [[lactone]]s, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or an inorganic acid. One example of an organic lactone is [[gamma-valerolactone|\u03b3-valerolactone]].\n\n=== Orthoesters ===\nAn uncommon class of organic esters are the [[orthoester]]s, which have the formula RC(OR\u2032)<sub>3</sub>. [[Triethyl orthoformate|Triethylorthoformate]] (HC(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from [[orthoformic acid]] (HC(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and [[ethanol]].\n\n=== Inorganic esters ===\n[[Image:Phosphate Group.svg|130px|thumb|A phosphoric acid ester]]\nEsters can also be derived from an inorganic acid and an alcohol. Thus, the nomenclature extends to inorganic oxo acids and their corresponding esters: [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphate esters]]/[[organophosphate]]s, [[sulfuric acid]] and sulfate esters/[[organosulfate]]s, [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]], and [[boric acid]] and [[borate#Borate esters|borate]]s. For example, [[triphenyl phosphate]] is the ester derived from [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phenol]]. Organic carbonates are derived from [[carbonic acid]]; for example, [[ethylene carbonate]] is derived from carbonic acid and [[ethylene glycol]].\n\nSo far an alcohol and inorganic acid are linked via oxygen atoms. The definition of inorganic acid ester that feature inorganic chemical elements links between alcohols and the inorganic acid \u2013 the phosphorus atom linking to three [[alkoxy]] functional groups in [[organophosphate]] \u2013 can be extended to the same elements in various combinations of [[covalent bonds]] between carbons and the central inorganic atom and carbon\u2013oxygen bonds to central inorganic atoms. For example, phosphorus features three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and one phosphorus\u2013oxygen ''double bond'' in organophosphates, three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds in [[phosphite ester]]s or organophosphites, two carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but one phosphorus\u2013carbon bond in phosphonites, one carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but two phosphorus\u2013carbon bonds in phosphinites.\n\nIn corollary, [[Organoboron chemistry#Borinic and boronic acids and esters|boron]] features [[borinic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[boronic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and [[borate]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).\n\nAs oxygen is a [[group 16]] chemical element, sulfur atoms can replace some oxygen atoms in carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013central inorganic atom covalent bonds of an ester. As a result, [[thiosulfinate]]s and [[thiosulfonate]]s, with a central inorganic sulfur atom, demonstrate clearly the assortment of [[organosulfur compounds|sulfur]] esters, that also includes [[organosulfate|sulfate]]s, [[sulfite]]s, [[sulfonate]]s, [[sulfinate]]s, [[sulfenate]]s esters.\n\n== Structure and bonding ==\nEsters contain a [[carbonyl]] center, which gives rise to 120\u00b0 C\u2013C\u2013O and O\u2013C\u2013O angles. Unlike [[amide]]s, esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C\u2013O\u2013C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides.<ref name=March>March, J.

The preference for the Z conformation is influenced by the nature of the substituents and solvent, if present.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Diwakar M. Pawar | author2 = Abdelnaser A.

They participate in [[hydrogen bond]]s as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than [[carboxylic acid]]s of similar molecular weight.<ref name=March/>\n\n=== Characterization and analysis ===\nEsters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]] for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730\u20131750&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> assigned to ''\u03bd''<sub>C=O</sub>. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjugation with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n== Applications and occurrence ==\nEsters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, [[fat]]s are in general triesters derived from [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.<ref>Isolation of triglyceride from nutmeg: G. D. Beal \"Trimyristen\" Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the [[fragrance]] and [[flavoring|flavor]] industry.

[[Sulfuric acid]] is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as [[Dowex|polymeric sulfonic acids]]. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]:\n* Using the alcohol in large excess (i.e., as a solvent).\n* Using a dehydrating agent: sulfuric acid not only catalyzes the reaction but sequesters water (a reaction product). Other drying agents such as [[molecular sieves]] are also effective.\n* Removal of water by physical means such as [[distillation]] as a low-boiling [[azeotrope]]s with [[toluene]], in conjunction with a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].\n\nReagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the [[Steglich esterification]], which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in [[peptide synthesis]], where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC ([[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]]) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction.

The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C\u2013H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms [[adduct]]s.\n\n===Hydrolysis and saponification <!--[[Ester hydrolysis]] redirects here-->===\nEsterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo [[hydrolysis]] under acid and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the [[Fischer esterification]]. Under basic conditions, [[hydroxide]] acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, [[saponification]], is the basis of soap making.\n:[[Image:Ester hydrolysis.png|400px|Ester saponification (basic hydrolysis)]]\n\nThe alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s to give [[amide]]s: (ammonolysis reaction)\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + NH<sub>2</sub>R\u2033 \u2192 RCONHR\u2033 + R\u2032OH\nThis reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to [[isocyanate]]s through intermediate [[hydroxamic acid]]s in the [[Lossen rearrangement]].\n\nSources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., [[Grignard reagent]]s and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.\n\n=== Reduction ===\nCompared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are [[Carbonyl reduction#Trends in carbonyl reactivity|relatively resistant to reduction]]. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to [[fatty alcohol]]s.\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RCH<sub>2</sub>OH + R\u2032OH\nA typical catalyst is [[copper chromite]].

Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic [[enolate]], which can further react, e.g., the [[Claisen condensation]] and its intramolecular equivalent, the [[Dieckmann condensation]].

Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called \"[[trivial names]]\" e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix ''-oate''. For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl [[Caprylic acid|caprylate]], has the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n[[Image:EtOAcImp.png|thumb|Ethyl acetate derived from an alcohol (blue) and an [[acyl]] group (yellow) derived from a carboxylic acid]]\n\nThe chemical formulas of organic esters usually take the form RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 are the hydrocarbon parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively. For example, [[butyl acetate]] (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from [[n-Butanol|butanol]] and [[acetic acid]] (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>. Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>.\n\nCyclic esters are called [[lactone]]s, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or an inorganic acid. One example of an organic lactone is [[gamma-valerolactone|\u03b3-valerolactone]].\n\n=== Orthoesters ===\nAn uncommon class of organic esters are the [[orthoester]]s, which have the formula RC(OR\u2032)<sub>3</sub>. Triethylorthoformate (HC(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from [[orthoformic acid]] (HC(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and [[ethanol]].\n\n=== Inorganic esters ===\n[[Image:Phosphate Group.svg|130px|thumb|A phosphoric acid ester]]\nEsters can also be derived from an inorganic acid and an alcohol. Thus, the nomenclature extends to inorganic oxo acids and their corresponding esters: [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphate esters]]/[[organophosphate]]s, [[sulfuric acid]] and sulfate esters/[[organosulfate]]s, [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]], and [[boric acid]] and [[borate#Borate esters|borate]]s. For example, [[triphenyl phosphate]] is the ester derived from [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phenol]]. Organic carbonates are derived from [[carbonic acid]]; for example, [[ethylene carbonate]] is derived from carbonic acid and [[ethylene glycol]].\n\nSo far an alcohol and inorganic acid are linked via oxygen atoms. The definition of inorganic acid ester that feature inorganic chemical elements links between alcohols and the inorganic acid \u2013 the phosphorus atom linking to three [[alkoxy]] functional groups in [[organophosphate]] \u2013 can be extended to the same elements in various combinations of [[covalent bonds]] between carbons and the central inorganic atom and carbon\u2013oxygen bonds to central inorganic atoms. For example, phosphorus features three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and one phosphorus\u2013oxygen ''double bond'' in organophosphates, three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds in [[phosphite ester]]s or organophosphites, two carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but one phosphorus\u2013carbon bond in phosphonites, one carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but two phosphorus\u2013carbon bonds in phosphinites.\n\nIn corollary, [[Organoboron chemistry#Borinic and boronic acids and esters|boron]] features [[borinic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[boronic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and [[borate]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).\n\nAs oxygen is a [[group 16]] chemical element, sulfur atoms can replace some oxygen atoms in carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013central inorganic atom covalent bonds of an ester. As a result, [[thiosulfinate]]s and [[thiosulfonate]]s, with a central inorganic sulfur atom, demonstrate clearly the assortment of [[organosulfur compounds|sulfur]] esters, that also includes [[organosulfate|sulfate]]s, [[sulfite]]s, [[sulfonate]]s, [[sulfinate]]s, [[sulfenate]]s esters.\n\n== Structure and bonding ==\nEsters contain a [[carbonyl]] center, which gives rise to 120\u00b0 C\u2013C\u2013O and O\u2013C\u2013O angles. Unlike [[amide]]s, esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C\u2013O\u2013C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides.<ref name=March>March, J.

The preference for the Z conformation is influenced by the nature of the substituents and solvent, if present.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Diwakar M. Pawar | author2 = Abdelnaser A.

They participate in [[hydrogen bond]]s as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than [[carboxylic acid]]s of similar molecular weight.<ref name=March/>\n\n=== Characterization and analysis ===\nEsters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]] for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730\u20131750&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> assigned to ''\u03bd''<sub>C=O</sub>. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjugation with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n== Applications and occurrence ==\nEsters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, [[fat]]s are in general triesters derived from [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.<ref>Isolation of triglyceride from nutmeg: G. D. Beal \"Trimyristen\" Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the [[fragrance]] and [[flavoring|flavor]] industry. Ester bonds are also found in many [[polymer]]s.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols===\nThe classic synthesis is the [[Fischer esterification]], which involves treating a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrating]] agent:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H + R\u2032OH {{eqm}} RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe equilibrium constant for such reactions is about 5 for typical esters, e.g., ethyl acetate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Roger J. | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Alton | last3 = Andrews | first3 = Roy C. | year = 1928 | title = The Relation Between the Hydrolysis Equilibrium Constant of Esters and the Strengths of the Corresponding Acids | url = | journal = J.

[[Sulfuric acid]] is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as [[Dowex|polymeric sulfonic acids]]. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]:\n* Using the alcohol in large excess (i.e., as a solvent).\n* Using a dehydrating agent: sulfuric acid not only catalyzes the reaction but sequesters water (a reaction product). Other drying agents such as [[molecular sieves]] are also effective.\n* Removal of water by physical means such as [[distillation]] as a low-boiling [[azeotrope]]s with [[toluene]], in conjunction with a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].\n\nReagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the [[Steglich esterification]], which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in [[peptide synthesis]], where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC ([[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]]) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction. [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine]] (DMAP) is used as an acyl-transfer [[catalyst]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = B. Neises | author2 = W.

The method is useful in specialized organic synthetic operations but is considered too hazardous and expensive for large-scale applications.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with epoxides===\nCarboxylic acids are esterified by treatment with epoxides, giving \u03b2-hydroxyesters:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H  + RCHCH<sub>2</sub>O   \u2192   RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(OH)R\nThis reaction is employed in the production of [[vinyl ester resin]] resins from [[acrylic acid]].\n\n=== Alcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides ===\nAlcohols react with [[acyl chloride]]s and [[acid anhydride]]s to give esters:\n: RCOCl + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + HCl\n: (RCO)<sub>2</sub>O + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + RCO<sub>2</sub>H\n\nThe reactions are irreversible simplifying [[work-up (chemistry)|work-up]]. Since acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides also react with water, anhydrous conditions are preferred. The analogous acylations of amines to give [[amide]]s are less sensitive because amines are stronger [[nucleophile]]s and react more rapidly than does water. This method is employed only for laboratory-scale procedures, as it is expensive.\n\n===Alkylation of carboxylate salts===\nAlthough not widely employed for esterifications, salts of carboxylate anions can be alkylating agent with [[alkyl halide]]s to give esters.<ref name=Ullmann/> In the case that an [[alkyl chloride]] is used, an iodide salt can catalyze the reaction ([[Finkelstein reaction]]). The carboxylate salt is often generated ''in situ''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=Kouichi|last2=Shimazaki|first2=Hayato|last3=Miyamoto|first3=Yu|last4=Shimada|first4=Kazuaki|last5=Haga|first5=Fumi|last6=Yamada|first6=Yuki|last7=Miyazawa|first7=Hirotsugu|last8=Nishiwaki|first8=Keiji|last9=Kashimura|first9=Shigenori|date=2014|title=Simple and Convenient Synthesis of Esters from Carboxylic Acids and Alkyl Halides Using Tetrabutylammonium Fluoride|url=http://jlc.jst.go.jp/DN/JST.JSTAGE/jos/ess13199?lang=en&from=CrossRef&type=abstract|journal=Journal of Oleo Science|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=539\u2013544|doi=10.5650/jos.ess13199|issn=1345-8957|doi-access=free}}</ref> In difficult cases, the silver carboxylate may be used, since the silver ion coordinates to the halide aiding its departure and improving the reaction rate.

The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C\u2013H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms [[adduct]]s.\n\n===Hydrolysis and saponification <!--[[Ester hydrolysis]] redirects here-->===\nEsterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo [[hydrolysis]] under acid and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the [[Fischer esterification]]. Under basic conditions, [[hydroxide]] acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, [[saponification]], is the basis of soap making.\n:[[Image:Ester hydrolysis.png|400px|Ester saponification (basic hydrolysis)]]\n\nThe alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s to give [[amide]]s: (ammonolysis reaction)\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + NH<sub>2</sub>R\u2033 \u2192 RCONHR\u2033 + R\u2032OH\nThis reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to [[isocyanate]]s through intermediate [[hydroxamic acid]]s in the [[Lossen rearrangement]].\n\nSources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., [[Grignard reagent]]s and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.\n\n=== Reduction ===\nCompared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are [[Carbonyl reduction#Trends in carbonyl reactivity|relatively resistant to reduction]]. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to [[fatty alcohol]]s.\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RCH<sub>2</sub>OH + R\u2032OH\nA typical catalyst is [[copper chromite]]. Prior to the development of [[catalytic hydrogenation]], esters were reduced on a large scale using the [[Bouveault\u2013Blanc reduction]]. This method, which is largely obsolete, uses sodium in the presence of proton sources.\n\nEspecially for fine chemical syntheses, [[lithium aluminium hydride]] is used to reduce esters to two primary alcohols. The related reagent sodium borohydride is slow in this reaction. [[DIBAH]] reduces esters to aldehydes.<ref>{{cite web | author = W.

The reaction can be achieved using [[triethylsilane]] with a variety of Lewis acids.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yato|first1=Michihisa|last2=Homma|first2=Koichi|last3=Ishida|first3=Akihiko|title=Reduction of carboxylic esters to ethers with triethyl silane in the combined use of titanium tetrachloride and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate|journal=Tetrahedron|date=June 2001|volume=57|issue=25|pages=5353\u20135359|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)00420-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sakai|first1=Norio|last2=Moriya|first2=Toshimitsu|last3=Konakahara|first3=Takeo|title=An Efficient One-Pot Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Ethers:\u2009 A Directly Reductive Deoxygenation of Esters Using an InBr3/Et3SiH Catalytic System|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|date=July 2007|volume=72|issue=15|pages=5920\u20135922|doi=10.1021/jo070814z|pmid=17602594}}</ref>\n\n=== Claisen condensation and related reactions ===\nAs for [[aldehydes]], the hydrogen atoms on the carbon adjacent (\"\u03b1 to\") the carboxyl group in esters are sufficiently acidic to undergo deprotonation, which in turn leads to a variety of useful reactions. Deprotonation requires relatively strong bases, such as [[alkoxide]]s. Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic [[enolate]], which can further react, e.g., the [[Claisen condensation]] and its intramolecular equivalent, the [[Dieckmann condensation]]. This conversion is exploited in the [[malonic ester synthesis]], wherein the diester of [[malonic acid]] reacts with an electrophile (e.g., [[alkyl halide]]), and is subsequently decarboxylated. Another variation is the [[Fr\u00e1ter\u2013Seebach alkylation]].\n\n=== Other reactions ===\n* Phenyl esters react to hydroxyarylketones in the [[Fries rearrangement]].\n* Specific esters are functionalized with an \u03b1-hydroxyl group in the [[Chan rearrangement]].\n* Esters with \u03b2-hydrogen atoms can be converted to alkenes in [[ester pyrolysis]].\n*A direct conversion of esters to [[nitriles]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(01)86746-0| title = A direct conversion of esters to nitriles| journal = Tetrahedron Letters| volume = 20| issue = 51| pages = 4907| year = 1979| last1 = Wood | first1 = J.

Protecting a carboxylic acid is useful in peptide synthesis, to prevent self-reactions of the bifunctional [[amino acid]]s. Methyl and ethyl esters are commonly available for many amino acids; the ''t''-butyl ester tends to be more expensive. However, ''t''-butyl esters are particularly useful because, under strongly acidic conditions, the ''t''-butyl esters undergo elimination to give the carboxylic acid and [[isobutylene]], simplifying work-up.\n\n== List of ester odorants ==\nMany esters have distinctive fruit-like odors, and many occur naturally in the essential oils of plants. This has also led to their common use in artificial flavorings and fragrances which aim to mimic those odors.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"| Ester name\n!
