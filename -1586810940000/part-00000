The stems can grow upright (''erect'') or spread out horizontally and then turn upright (''decumbent'').<ref name=Anderberg2013>{{cite book |first1=A.

The petiole is short or the leaf tapers gradually towards the base. [[Phyllotaxis|Leaf arrangement]] is typically alternate but some are opposite or whorled, and there is generally a rosette at the base of the stem. The edges are toothed ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#Edge|''dentate'']]) or sawtoothed. New leaves in the bud are usually ''involute'' (rolled towards the upper surface) or ''conduplicate'' (folded upwards), but a few species roll downwards.<ref name=Anderberg2013/><ref name=Xu/>\n\n=== Flowers ===\nEach flower is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Flowering plants|bisexual]], having both [[stamen]]s and [[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpels]]. They have [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|radial symmetry]];  the [[petal]]s can be separate or partially or fully [[Connation|fused together]] to form a tube-shaped [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] that opens up at the mouth to form a bell-like shape (as in item 8 in the figure) or a flat-faced flower. In most of the families of Ericales, stamens alternate with lobes, but in Primulaceae there is a stamen opposite each petal.<ref name=Anderberg2002/>\n\nThe [[sepal|calyx]] has 4 to 9 lobes and persists after flowering.<ref name=Xu/> They are grouped in unbranched, [[Inflorescence#Indeterminate or racemose|indeterminate clusters]] such as racemes, spikes, corymbs or umbels.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>\n\n=== Reproductive anatomy ===\nThe fruit of Primulaceae begins as an [[ovary]] and inside it are the future seeds ([[ovule]]s). These are attached to a central axis without any partitions between them (an arrangement called ''[[Placentation#In plants|free central placentation]]''; see item 7 in the figure), and they are ''bitegmic'' (having a double protective layer around each ovule). Unlike in most other families of Ericales, both layers form the opening at the top (the ''micropyle'').<ref name=Anderberg2002/>\n\n=== Seeds and fruit ===\nAs seeds develop, an [[endosperm]] grows around the embryo through free division of nuclei without forming walls (''nuclear endosperm formation''). The embryo forms a pair of short, narrow [[cotyledon]]s (item 10 in the figure).<ref name=Anderberg2013/> Usually multiple seeds are in a [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] that is carried on a straight stalk ([[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] or [[Scape (botany)|scape]]). After it matures, it [[Dehiscence (botany)|splits apart]], releasing the seeds ballistically.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe British National Collection of Double Primroses is held at Glebe Garden, at [[North Petherwin]], in [[North Cornwall]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://glebegarden.co.uk/|title=Glebe Garden|website=Glebe Garden}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2015/jun/02/double-primroses|title=Double primroses: pretty, difficult|first=Andy|last=Byfield|date=June 2, 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallgardenstrust.org.uk/double-primroses-national-primrose-collection-launceston-pl15-8jx/|title=CORNWALL GARDENS TRUST \u00bb Events \u00bb Double Primroses (National Primrose Collection) Launceston, PL15 8JX|website=www.cornwallgardenstrust.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=300px>\nFile:133 Anagallis arvensis.jpg|''[[Lysimachia arvensis]]''\nFile:Illustration Soldanella alpina0.jpg|''[[Soldanella alpina]]'', ''Androsace helvetica'' & ''Androsace chamaejasme''\nFile:Illustration Anagallis caerulea0 clean.jpg|''[[Lysimachia foemina]]''\nFile:Illustration Hottonia palustris0.jpg| ''[[Hottonia palustris]]''\nFile:Illustration Cyclamen purpurascens0.jpg|''[[Cyclamen purpurascens]]''\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=MontanaPlantLife>{{cite web|url=http://montana.plant-life.org/families/Primulaceae.htm|title=Primulaceae - Primrose Family|publisher=PlantLife.org|accessdate=28 September 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=Species>{{cite web|url=http://baydelta.ucdavis.edu/plants/?q=taxonomy/term/632|title=Primulaceae|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=28 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831103648/http://baydelta.ucdavis.edu/plants/?q=taxonomy%2Fterm%2F632|archivedate=31 August 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=Bharati |title=Systematic botany |date=2005 |publisher=Alpha Science International |isbn=9781842652510 |pages=216\u2013218}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Datta |first1=Subhash C. |chapter=Primulaceae |title=Systematic botany |date=1988 |publisher=New Age Intl |isbn=9788122400137 |pages=387\u2013388}}\n*{{cite journal |last=K\u00e4llersj\u00f6 |first=M. |first2=G. |last2=Bergqvist |first3=A.A. |last3=Anderberg |year=2000 |title=Generic realignment in primuloid families of the Ericales s. l.: a phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences from three chloroplast genes and morphology |journal=Am.

The stems can grow upright (''erect'') or spread out horizontally and then turn upright (''decumbent'').<ref name=Anderberg2013>{{cite book |first1=A.

The petiole is short or the leaf tapers gradually towards the base. [[Phyllotaxis|Leaf arrangement]] is typically alternate but some are opposite or whorled, and there is generally a rosette at the base of the stem. The edges are toothed ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#Edge|''dentate'']]) or sawtoothed. New leaves in the bud are usually ''involute'' (rolled towards the upper surface) or ''conduplicate'' (folded upwards), but a few species roll downwards.<ref name=Anderberg2013/><ref name=Xu/>\n\n=== Flowers ===\nEach flower is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Flowering plants|bisexual]], having both [[stamen]]s and [[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpels]]. They have [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|radial symmetry]];  the [[petal]]s can be separate or partially or fully [[Connation|fused together]] to form a tube-shaped [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] that opens up at the mouth to form a bell-like shape (as in item 8 in the figure) or a flat-faced flower. In most of the families of Ericales, stamens alternate with lobes, but in Primulaceae there is a stamen opposite each petal.<ref name=Anderberg2002/>\n\nThe [[sepal|calyx]] has 4 to 9 lobes and persists after flowering.<ref name=Xu/> They are grouped in unbranched, [[Inflorescence#Indeterminate or racemose|indeterminate clusters]] such as racemes, spikes, corymbs or umbels.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>\n\n=== Reproductive anatomy ===\nThe fruit of Primulaceae begins as an [[ovary]] and inside it are the future seeds ([[ovule]]s). These are attached to a central axis without any partitions between them (an arrangement called ''[[Placentation#In plants|free central placentation]]''; see item 7 in the figure), and they are ''bitegmic'' (having a double protective layer around each ovule). Unlike in most other families of Ericales, both layers form the opening at the top (the ''micropyle'').<ref name=Anderberg2002/>\n\n=== Seeds and fruit ===\nAs seeds develop, an [[endosperm]] grows around the embryo through free division of nuclei without forming walls (''nuclear endosperm formation''). The embryo forms a pair of short, narrow [[cotyledon]]s (item 10 in the figure).<ref name=Anderberg2013/> Usually multiple seeds are in a [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] that is carried on a straight stalk ([[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] or [[Scape (botany)|scape]]). After it matures, it [[Dehiscence (botany)|splits apart]], releasing the seeds ballistically.<ref name=Anderberg2013/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe British National Collection of Double Primroses is held at Glebe Garden, at [[North Petherwin]], in [[North Cornwall]].<ref>https://glebegarden.co.uk/</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2015/jun/02/double-primroses</ref><ref>https://www.cornwallgardenstrust.org.uk/double-primroses-national-primrose-collection-launceston-pl15-8jx/</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=300px>\nFile:133 Anagallis arvensis.jpg|''[[Lysimachia arvensis]]''\nFile:Illustration Soldanella alpina0.jpg|''[[Soldanella alpina]]'', ''Androsace helvetica'' & ''Androsace chamaejasme''\nFile:Illustration Anagallis caerulea0 clean.jpg|''[[Lysimachia foemina]]''\nFile:Illustration Hottonia palustris0.jpg| ''[[Hottonia palustris]]''\nFile:Illustration Cyclamen purpurascens0.jpg|''[[Cyclamen purpurascens]]''\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=MontanaPlantLife>{{cite web|url=http://montana.plant-life.org/families/Primulaceae.htm|title=Primulaceae - Primrose Family|publisher=PlantLife.org|accessdate=28 September 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=Species>{{cite web|url=http://baydelta.ucdavis.edu/plants/?q=taxonomy/term/632|title=Primulaceae|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=28 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831103648/http://baydelta.ucdavis.edu/plants/?q=taxonomy%2Fterm%2F632|archivedate=31 August 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=Bharati |title=Systematic botany |date=2005 |publisher=Alpha Science International |isbn=9781842652510 |pages=216\u2013218}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Datta |first1=Subhash C. |chapter=Primulaceae |title=Systematic botany |date=1988 |publisher=New Age Intl |isbn=9788122400137 |pages=387\u2013388}}\n*{{cite journal |last=K\u00e4llersj\u00f6 |first=M. |first2=G. |last2=Bergqvist |first3=A.A. |last3=Anderberg |year=2000 |title=Generic realignment in primuloid families of the Ericales s. l.: a phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences from three chloroplast genes and morphology |journal=Am.

He wrote the [[DeCSS]] software, which decodes the [[Content Scramble System]] used for [[DVD]] licensing enforcement. Johansen is a [[autodidact|self-trained]] [[software engineer]], who quit high school during his first year to spend more time with the DeCSS case. He moved to the United States and worked as a software engineer from October 2005 until November 2006.  He then moved to Norway but moved back to the United States in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/about/ | title=About | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | year=2004 | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nIn a post on his blog, he said that in the 1990s he started with a book (''Programming the 8086/8088''), the web (\"[[Fravia]]'s site was a goldmine\") and [[IRC]] (\"Lurked in a x86 assembly IRC channel and picked up tips from wise wizards.\")<ref>Jon Lech Johansen\u2019s blog, [http://nanocr.eu/2006/02/09/reverse-engineering/ \"Reverse Engineering\"], 2006-02-09. Retrieved on 2010-06-29.</ref>\n\n== DeCSS prosecution ==\nAfter Johansen released [[DeCSS]], he was taken to court in Norway for computer hacking in 2002. The prosecution was conducted by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (''\u00d8kokrim'' in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD-CCA) and the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA).  Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The trial opened in the [[Oslo District Court]] on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else's information, since Johansen owned the [[DVD]]s himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, [[acquittal|acquitting]] Johansen of all charges.\n\nTwo further levels of [[appeal]]s were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. \u00d8kokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 and it was reported on 28 February that the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] had agreed to hear the case. Johansen's second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. \u00d8kokrim announced on 5 January 2004 that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.\n\n==Other projects==\n{{proseline|section|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Johansen's career has included many other projects.\n\n===2001===\nIn 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.\n\n===2003===\nIn November 2003, Johansen released [[QTFairUse]], an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s online music store. Although these resulting raw AAC files were unplayable by most media players at the time of release, they represent the first attempt at circumventing Apple's encryption.\n\n===2004===\nJohansen had by now become a [[VideoLAN]] developer, and had reverse engineered [[FairPlay]] and written VLC's FairPlay support.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | title=DVD Jon on VLC and Apple's iTunes singles | publisher=Boing Boing | first=Cory | last=Doctorow | authorlink=Cory Doctorow | date=2004-03-26 | accessdate=2007-08-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093239/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref> It has been available in VideoLAN [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] since January 2004, but the first release to include FairPlay support is VLC 0.7.1 (released March 2, 2004).\n\n===2005===\n[[File:Jon Lech Johansen.jpg|thumb|DVD Jon in Oslo, 2005]]\n\nOn March 18, 2005, [[Travis Watkins (computer programmer)|Travis Watkins]] and Cody Brocious, along with Johansen, wrote [[PyMusique]], a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] based program which allows the download of purchased files from the iTunes Music Store without [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) encryption.<ref>Smith, Tony (March 18, 2005) &ndash; [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/18/itunes_pymusique/ \"DVD Jon: buy DRM-less tracks from Apple iTunes\"]</ref> This was possible because Apple Computer's iTunes software adds the DRM to the music file after the music file is downloaded. On March 22, Apple released a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the iTunes Music Store blocking the use of his PyMusique program. The same day, an update to PyMusique was released, circumventing the new patch.\n\nOn June 26, 2005, Johansen created a modification of Google's new in-browser video player (which was based on the open source VLC media player) less than 24 hours after its release, to allow the user to play videos that are not hosted on Google\u2019s servers. The significance of the modification was exaggerated by the online media.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/2005/06/28/google-video-viewer/ | title=Google Video Viewer | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | date=2005-06-28 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2005, [[H\u00e5kon Wium Lie]], the Norwegian CTO of [[Opera Software]], co-creator of Cascading Style Sheets and long-time supporter of open source, named Johansen a \"hero\" in a net meeting arranged by one of Norway's biggest newspapers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/05/10/431391.html | title=DVD-Jon er en helt | first=Lars Eirik | last=Eide | newspaper =Dagbladet | language=Norwegian | date=2005-05-10 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> On September 2, 2005, ''The Register'' published news that DVD Jon had defeated encryption in Microsoft's Windows Media Player by reverse engineering a proprietary algorithm that was ostensibly used to protect [[Windows Media Station]] NSC files from engineers sniffing for the files' source IP address, port or stream format.

Johansen is a [[autodidact|self-trained]] [[software engineer]], who quit high school during his first year to spend more time with the DeCSS case. He moved to the United States and worked as a software engineer from October 2005 until November 2006.  He then moved to Norway but moved back to the United States in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/about/ | title=About | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | year=2004 | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJohansen is featured in the documentary film ''[[Info_Wars_(film)|Info Wars]]''.\n\n==Education==\nIn a post on his blog, he said that in the 1990s he started with a book (''Programming the 8086/8088''), the web (\"[[Fravia]]'s site was a goldmine\") and [[IRC]] (\"Lurked in a x86 assembly IRC channel and picked up tips from wise wizards.\")<ref>Jon Lech Johansen\u2019s blog, [http://nanocr.eu/2006/02/09/reverse-engineering/ \"Reverse Engineering\"], 2006-02-09. Retrieved on 2010-06-29.</ref>\n\n== DeCSS prosecution ==\nAfter Johansen released [[DeCSS]], he was taken to court in Norway for computer hacking in 2002. The prosecution was conducted by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (''\u00d8kokrim'' in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD-CCA) and the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA).  Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The trial opened in the [[Oslo District Court]] on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else's information, since Johansen owned the [[DVD]]s himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, [[acquittal|acquitting]] Johansen of all charges.\n\nTwo further levels of [[appeal]]s were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. \u00d8kokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 and it was reported on 28 February that the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] had agreed to hear the case.\n\nJohansen's second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. \u00d8kokrim announced on 5 January 2004 that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.\n\n==Other projects==\n{{proseline|section|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Johansen's career has included many other projects.\n\n===2001===\nIn 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.\n\n===2003===\nIn November 2003, Johansen released [[QTFairUse]], an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s online music store. Although these resulting raw AAC files were unplayable by most media players at the time of release, they represent the first attempt at circumventing Apple's encryption.\n\n===2004===\nJohansen had by now become a [[VideoLAN]] developer, and had reverse engineered [[FairPlay]] and written VLC's FairPlay support.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | title=DVD Jon on VLC and Apple's iTunes singles | publisher=Boing Boing | first=Cory | last=Doctorow | authorlink=Cory Doctorow | date=2004-03-26 | accessdate=2007-08-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093239/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref> It has been available in VideoLAN [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] since January 2004, but the first release to include FairPlay support is VLC 0.7.1 (released March 2, 2004).\n\nOn April 25, 2004 Johansen released yet another program: DeDRMS. Written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], this 230 line program also removes copy protection.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nOn July 7, 2004 he released FairKeys, a program that can be used to retrieve the keys needed by DeDRMS from the iTunes Music Store servers themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nOn August 12, 2004 Johansen announced on his website that he defeated Apple's [[AirPort|AirPort Express]]'s encryption which lets users stream Apple Lossless files to their AirPort Expresses.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nOn November 25, 2004 he released a [[proof of concept]] program that allows Linux users (via [[VLC media player|VLC]]) to play video encoded with Microsoft's proprietary WMV9 codec, by porting the reference version of the software.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This was a significant development as Microsoft had been lobbying to have their codec used with the next DVD standard.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===2005===\n[[File:Jon Lech Johansen.jpg|thumb|DVD Jon in Oslo, 2005]]\n\nOn March 18, 2005, [[Travis Watkins (computer programmer)|Travis Watkins]] and Cody Brocious, along with Johansen, wrote [[PyMusique]], a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] based program which allows the download of purchased files from the iTunes Music Store without [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] encryption.<ref>Smith, Tony (March 18, 2005) &ndash; [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/18/itunes_pymusique/ \"DVD Jon: buy DRM-less tracks from Apple iTunes\"]</ref> This was possible because Apple Computer's iTunes software adds the DRM to the music file after the music file is downloaded. On March 22, Apple released a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the iTunes Music Store blocking the use of his PyMusique program. The same day, an update to PyMusique was released, circumventing the new patch.\n\nOn June 26, 2005, Johansen created a modification of Google's new in-browser video player (which was based on the open source VLC media player) in less than 24 hours after its release, to allow the user to play videos that are not hosted on Google\u2019s servers. The significance of the modification was exaggerated by the online media.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/2005/06/28/google-video-viewer/ | title=Google Video Viewer | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | date=2005-06-28 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIn late summer, [[H\u00e5kon Wium Lie]], the Norwegian CTO of [[Opera Software]], co-creator of Cascading Style Sheets and long-time supporter of open source, named Jon Lech Johansen a \"hero\" in a net meeting arranged by one of Norway's biggest newspapers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/05/10/431391.html | title=DVD-Jon er en helt | first=Lars Eirik | last=Eide | newspaper =Dagbladet | language=Norwegian | date=2005-05-10 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>\n\nOn September 2, 2005, ''The Register'' published news that DVD Jon had defeated encryption in Microsoft's Windows Media Player by reverse engineering a proprietary algorithm that was ostensibly used to protect [[Windows Media Station]] NSC files from engineers sniffing for the files' source IP address, port or stream format.

But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in [[Barbados]]; 300,000 in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], both British colonies; and 450,000 in French [[Saint-Domingue]], which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.<ref name=\"drimmer\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160705125708/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919107?seq=1 Melvin Drimmer, \"Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by Herbert S.

Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.</ref> When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Pocock]] and the Commander of the Land Forces [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the underdeveloped sugar plantations.<ref name=\"Siege\"/>\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|The [[British expedition against Cuba|British invasion and occupation of Havana]] in 1762]]\n\nThough Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.<ref name=\"Siege\"/> Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].\n\nThe real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing \"pearl of the Antilles\" that Haiti had been before the revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107029422|location = New York|pages = 5}}</ref> As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, \"At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba.

The United States lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] 21&nbsp;km (13&nbsp;mi) to the north. [[Mexico]] lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] to the west (to the closest tip of [[Cabo Catoche]] in the State of [[Quintana Roo]]).\n\n[[Haiti]] is 77&nbsp;km (48&nbsp;mi) to the east, [[Jamaica]] (140&nbsp;km/87&nbsp;mi) and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camag\u00fcey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.\n\n[[File:Sierra Maestra panorama1.jpg|thumb|[[Sierra Maestra]] ]] \nThe main island, named Cuba, is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}.

The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of [[Hong Kong]], which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|\u00b0C|1}} in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] combine to make the country prone to frequent [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]].

Rumba (\"de caj\u00f3n o de solar\") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|title=Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and Artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920\u20131940|year=1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-5645-7}}</ref> The [[Tres (musical instrument)|Tres]] was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Ta\u00edno nations|Ta\u00edno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[g\u00fciro]], [[mar\u00edmbula]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuac\u00e1n]].\n\nPopular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.\n\nDuring that time, [[reggaet\u00f3n]] grew in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced \"low-profile\" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani Garc\u00eda]], characterizing its description of sex as \"the sort which a prostitute would carry out.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being \"Sexually Explicit\" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666 |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and \"Sexually Explicit\" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\nAs well as pop, classical and rock are very popular in Cuba.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}\n[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]\n[[File:La Havane (1) Tamales pli\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|Cuban-style tamales]]\nCuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.\n\nThe typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos (food)|moros y cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Cuban literature}}\nCuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica \u2013 Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Alejo Carpentier]] was important in the [[Magic realism]] movement. Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Da\u00edna Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Guti\u00e9rrez]], [[Zo\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.\n\n===Dance===\nDance holds a privileged position in Cuban culture. [[Popular dance]] is considered an essential part of life, and [[concert dance]] is supported by the government and includes internationally renowned companies such as the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba]].<ref name=\"Johnn\">{{cite book | last=John | first=S. | title=Contemporary Dance in Cuba: Tecnica Cubana as Revolutionary Movement | publisher=McFarland & Company | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-7864-9325-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE0KI3h-7UC&pg=PA23 | page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Cuba}}\nDue to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is the most popular. Other sports and pastimes include [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[sport of athletics|athletics]].

But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in [[Barbados]]; 300,000 in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], both British colonies; and 450,000 in French [[Saint-Domingue]], which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.<ref name=\"drimmer\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160705125708/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919107?seq=1 Melvin Drimmer, \"Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by Herbert S.

Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.</ref> When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Pocock]] and the Commander of the Land Forces [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the underdeveloped sugar plantations.<ref name=\"Siege\"/>\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|The [[British expedition against Cuba|British invasion and occupation of Havana]] in 1762]]\n\nThough Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.<ref name=\"Siege\"/> Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].\n\nThe real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing \"pearl of the Antilles\" that Haiti had been before the revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107029422|location = New York|pages = 5}}</ref> As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, \"At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba.

The United States lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] 21&nbsp;km (13&nbsp;mi) to the north. [[Mexico]] lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] to the west (to the closest tip of [[Cabo Catoche]] in the State of [[Quintana Roo]]).\n\n[[Haiti]] is 77&nbsp;km (48&nbsp;mi) to the east, [[Jamaica]] (140&nbsp;km/87&nbsp;mi) and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camag\u00fcey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.\n\n[[File:Sierra Maestra panorama1.jpg|thumb|[[Sierra Maestra]] ]] \nThe main island, named Cuba, is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}.

The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of [[Hong Kong]], which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|\u00b0C|1}} in July.

Rumba (\"de caj\u00f3n o de solar\") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|title=Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and Artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920\u20131940|year=1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-5645-7}}</ref> The [[Tres (musical instrument)|Tres]] was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Ta\u00edno nations|Ta\u00edno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[g\u00fciro]], [[mar\u00edmbula]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuac\u00e1n]].\n\nPopular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.\n\nDuring that time, [[reggaet\u00f3n]] grew in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced \"low-profile\" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani Garc\u00eda]], characterizing its description of sex as \"the sort which a prostitute would carry out.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being \"Sexually Explicit\" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666 |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and \"Sexually Explicit\" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\nAs well as pop, classical and rock are very popular in Cuba.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}\n[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]\n[[File:La Havane (1) Tamales pli\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|Cuban-style tamales]]\nCuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.\n\nThe typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos (food)|moros y cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Cuban literature}}\nCuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica \u2013 Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Alejo Carpentier]] was important in the [[Magic realism]] movement. Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Da\u00edna Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Guti\u00e9rrez]], [[Zo\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.\n\n===Dance===\nDance holds a privileged position in Cuban culture. [[Popular dance]] is considered an essential part of life, and [[concert dance]] is supported by the government and includes internationally renowned companies such as the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba]].<ref name=\"Johnn\">{{cite book | last=John | first=S. | title=Contemporary Dance in Cuba: Tecnica Cubana as Revolutionary Movement | publisher=McFarland & Company | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-7864-9325-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE0KI3h-7UC&pg=PA23 | page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Cuba}}\nDue to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is the most popular. Other sports and pastimes include [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[sport of athletics|athletics]].

The territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business.\n\nEuropeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and founded the colony of Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and [[Bayou Nezpique]], where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to French soldiers and settlers.\n\n''Poste des Atakapas'' (Attakapas Post) was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from [[France]], such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from [[Grenoble]]. Gabriel [[Fuselier de la Claire]], a Frenchman from [[Lyon]], and some other Frenchmen from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763 or early 1764.  Fuselier bought land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] from the Eastern Attakapas chief [[Kinemo]]. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa ([[Opelousas]]) invaded the area via the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]] rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan.  Gabriel Fuselier's son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as [[New Iberia, Louisiana]].\n\nGradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first [[Acadians]] from [[Nova Scotia]]. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]], the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been [[Expulsion of Acadians|expelled from Acadia]] by the British, who had defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer ''[[La Louisiane]]''.\n\nThe Acadians were led by [[Joseph Broussard]]. In 1768-1769 fifteen families arrived from [[Pointe Coupee]], another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Ha\u00efti]]) or from [[Paris]] via [[Fort de Chartres]], in present-day Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain \u00c9tienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.\n\nOn April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767 the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee.\n\nIn 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue during its slave revolt, [[Napoleon]] sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  The US settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, [[Saint Martin Parish]] was created. Attakapas Post was renamed as [[Saint Martinville]] and designated as the parish seat.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 652\n|1870= 1190\n|1880= 1606\n|1890= 1814\n|1900= 1926\n|1910= 2318\n|1920= 2465\n|1930= 2455\n|1940= 3501\n|1950= 4614\n|1960= 6468\n|1970= 7153\n|1980= 7965\n|1990= 7137\n|2000= 6989\n|2010= 6114\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=5903\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2017-05-03|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 6,114 people, 2,320 households, and 1,533 families residing in the city.

Its terrain is mixture of swamp and prairie.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site]]]]\n[[File:StMartinChurchWM.JPG|thumb|right|[[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church (St. Martinville, Louisiana)|St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church]]]]\nIn the 16th century, the area between the [[Atchafalaya River]], in Louisiana, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], in [[Texas]], was occupied by numerous tribes or subdivisions of the [[Attakapan]] people. The territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business.\n\nEuropeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and founded the colony of Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and [[Bayou Nezpique]], where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to French soldiers and settlers.\n\n''Poste des Atakapas'' (Attakapas Post) was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from [[France]], such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from [[Grenoble]]. Gabriel [[Fuselier de la Claire]], a Frenchman from [[Lyon]], and some other Frenchmen from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763 or early 1764.  Fuselier bought land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] from the Eastern Attakapas chief [[Kinemo]]. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa ([[Opelousas]]) invaded the area via the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]] rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan.  Gabriel Fuselier's son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as [[New Iberia, Louisiana]].\n\nGradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first [[Acadians]] from [[Nova Scotia]]. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]], the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been [[Expulsion of Acadians|expelled from Acadia]] by the British, who had defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer ''[[La Louisiane]]''.\n\nThe Acadians were led by [[Joseph Broussard]]. In 1768-1769 fifteen families arrived from [[Pointe Coupee]], another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Ha\u00efti]]) or from [[Paris]] via [[Fort de Chartres]], in present-day Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain \u00c9tienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.\n\nOn April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767 the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee.\n\nIn 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue during its slave revolt, [[Napoleon]] sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  The US settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, [[Saint Martin Parish]] was created. Attakapas Post was renamed as [[Saint Martinville]] and designated as the parish seat.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 652\n|1870= 1190\n|1880= 1606\n|1890= 1814\n|1900= 1926\n|1910= 2318\n|1920= 2465\n|1930= 2455\n|1940= 3501\n|1950= 4614\n|1960= 6468\n|1970= 7153\n|1980= 7965\n|1990= 7137\n|2000= 6989\n|2010= 6114\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=5903\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2017-05-03|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 6,114 people, 2,320 households, and 1,533 families residing in the city.

It is situated amid mud-flats and marshes on the left bank of the [[Danube]] facing the [[Bulgaria]]n city of [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] on the opposite bank. Three small islands face the city, and a larger one shelters its port, Smarda. The rich grain-growing land to the north is traversed by a railway to [[Bucharest]], the first line opened in Romania, which was built in 1869 and afterwards extended to Smarda.

During [[Roman times]] this was the site of [[Theodorapolis]], a city built by the Roman emperor [[Justinian]] (483-565).\n\nThe city of Giurgiu was probably established in the 14th century as a port on the [[Danube]] by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchant adventurers, who established a bank and traded in silks and velvets.\n\nOne theory is that they called the city after the patron saint of Genoa, San Giorgio ([[St George]]), however [[Nicolae Iorga]] disputes this theory, arguing that Giurgiu is just an old Romanian form of George.<ref>{{cite book |last=Iorga |first=Nicolae |date=1928 |title=Istoria Rom\u00e2nilor prin c\u0103l\u0103tori |trans-title=History of Romanians through travellers |url=https://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Istoria_rom\u00e2nilor_prin_c\u0103l\u0103tori/\u00cenainte_de_\u00eentemeierea_domniilor |language=ro |location=Bucharest |publisher=Casa \u0218coalelor |isbn= |accessdate= |page=18}}</ref>\n\nIt was first mentioned in [[Codex Latinus Parisinus]] in 1395, during the reign of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]], and was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1420 as a way to control the Danube traffic. The Ottomans named the city ''Yerg\u00f6\u011f\u00fc'', as if from ''yer'' 'earth' + ''g\u00f6k'' 'sky,' but the name was probably given because of the similarity between the pronunciations of \"(San) Giorgio\" and \"Yerg\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\".\n\nAs a fortified city, Giurgiu figured often in the wars for the conquest of the lower Danube. It was the site of the October 1595 [[Battle of Giurgiu]], and figured in the struggle of [[Michael the Brave]] (1593\u20131601) against the Turks and in the later [[Russo-Turkish War (1787-1792)]].

The seat of [[Giurgiu County]], it lies in the historical region of [[Muntenia]]. It is situated amid mud-flats and marshes on the left bank of the [[Danube]] facing the [[Bulgaria]]n city of [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] on the opposite bank. Three small islands face the city, and a larger one shelters its port, Smarda. The rich grain-growing land to the north is traversed by a railway to [[Bucharest]], the first line opened in Romania, which was built in 1869 and afterwards extended to Smarda. Giurgiu exports timber, grain, salt and petroleum, and imports coal, iron, and textiles.\n\nThe [[Danube Bridge|Giurgiu-Ruse Friendship Bridge]], in the shared [[Bulgaria]]n-Romanian section of the Danube, crosses the river in the outskirts of the city.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|image1=Raffet - Foire de St. Pierre a Giourgevo.jpg|caption1=|image2=Giurgiu1848.jpg|caption2=Giurgiu in 1837}}\nThe area around Giurgiu was densely populated at the time of the [[Dacians]] (1st century BC) as archeological evidence shows, and [[Burebista]]'s capital was in this area (it is thought to be in [[Mih\u0103ile\u0219ti|Pope\u015fti]] on the [[Arge\u015f River]]). During [[Roman times]] this was the site of [[Theodorapolis]], a city built by the Roman emperor [[Justinian]] (483-565).\n\nThe city of Giurgiu was probably established in the 14th century as a port on the [[Danube]] by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchant adventurers, who established a bank and traded in silks and velvets.\n\nOne theory is that they called the city after the patron saint of Genoa, San Giorgio ([[St George]]), however [[Nicolae Iorga]] disputes this theory, arguing that Giurgiu is just an old Romanian form of George.<ref>{{cite book |last=Iorga |first=Nicolae |date=1928 |title=Istoria Rom\u00e2nilor prin c\u0103l\u0103tori |trans-title=History of Romanians through travellers |url=https://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Istoria_rom\u00e2nilor_prin_c\u0103l\u0103tori/\u00cenainte_de_\u00eentemeierea_domniilor |language=ro |location=Bucharest |publisher=Casa \u0218coalelor |isbn= |accessdate= |page=18}}</ref>\n\nIt was first mentioned in [[Codex Latinus Parisinus]] in 1395, during the reign of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]], and was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1420 as a way to control the Danube traffic. The Ottomans named the city ''Yerg\u00f6\u011f\u00fc'', as if from ''yer'' 'earth' + ''g\u00f6k'' 'sky,' but the name was probably given because of the similarity between the pronunciations of \"(San) Giorgio\" and \"Yerg\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\".\n\nAs a fortified city, Giurgiu figured often in the wars for the conquest of the lower Danube. It was the site of the October 1595 [[Battle of Giurgiu]], and figured in the struggle of [[Michael the Brave]] (1593\u20131601) against the Turks and in the later [[Russo-Turkish War (1787-1792)]]. It was burned in 1659. In 1771, the Ottomans built the [[monument istoric|historic]] [[Giurgiu Clocktower]] as a surveillance tower for [[Danube]] traffic.

His daughter Winona married Negnaska and lived in what is now Indiana. She was executed in the 1830s by her husband's people after she killed Negnaska for selling her pony.<ref name=\"Winona Story\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCDiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA582 Fuller, George Newman and Beeson, Lewis]''Michigan History Vol. 6'' Lansing: Michigan State Historical Society, 1922. p. 582</ref> Winona's husband had pledged his rifle to Aaron B. Goodwin of [[Fremont, Indiana]] for the use of a 5-gallon keg. The Indians had the keg filled with whiskey at Nichols' store in Jamestown, and he took all the money they had. Negnaska sold his wife Winona's pony in order to pawn his rifle. Winona owned the pony outright, either as a gift from her father or having bought it with her own money. She killed Negnaska in anger for selling what was hers. Winona was held by the tribe for a few hours, until her husband's nearest relative arrived to execute her. As was their custom, he stabbed her to the heart as she had her husband.<ref name=\"Winona History\"/>\n\nJohn D. Barnard and Sheldon Havens were said to have encountered the Potawatomi group after the execution; they helped them move the bodies to a nearby grave that had been dug. The Indians did not bury the bodies until after the white men were out of sight. But Dr. B.F. Sheldon found out about it and exhumed the bodies for dissection a few days later, outraging the mourning Potawatomi. About two weeks later some Potawatomi returned the keg to Goodwin and tried to retrieve Negnaska's rifle, but Goodwin pretended not to know the man had been killed and refused to release the rifle to his friends.<ref name=\"Winona History\">[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsteuben00inte/historyofsteuben00inte_djvu.txt ''History of Steuben County, Indiana''], Chicago: Inter-state Publishing

Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>\n\nSteuben County is part of [[Indiana's 3rd congressional district]] and in 2008 was represented by [[Mark Souder]] in the [[United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://souder.house.gov/|title=US Congressman Mark Souder|publisher=US Congress|access-date=2008-10-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009142714/http://souder.house.gov/|archive-date=2008-10-09|df=}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Typically they lived in highly decentralized bands. Treaties signed by some leaders with United States representatives ceded large areas of their territory to the US.\n\nSteuben County was officially created by European Americans in 1837 from [[LaGrange County, Indiana|LaGrange County]], and named for [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron Frederick von Steuben]], an officer of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

His daughter Winona married Negnaska and lived in what is now Indiana. She was executed in the 1830s by her husband's people after she killed Negnaska for selling her pony.<ref name=\"Winona Story\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCDiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA582 Fuller, George Newman and Beeson, Lewis]''Michigan History Vol. 6'' Lansing: Michigan State Historical Society, 1922. p. 582</ref> Winona's husband had pledged his rifle to Aaron B. Goodwin of [[Fremont, Indiana]] for the use of a 5-gallon keg. The Indians had the keg filled with whiskey at Nichols' store in Jamestown, and he took all the money they had. Negnaska sold his wife Winona's pony in order to pawn his rifle. Winona owned the pony outright, either as a gift from her father or having bought it with her own money. She killed Negnaska in anger for selling what was hers. Winona was held by the tribe for a few hours, until her husband's nearest relative arrived to execute her. As was their custom, he stabbed her to the heart as she had her husband.<ref name=\"Winona History\"/>\n\t\nJohn D. Barnard and Sheldon Havens were said to have encountered the Potawatomi group after the execution; they helped them move the bodies to a nearby grave that had been dug. The Indians did not bury the bodies until after the white men were out of sight. But Dr. B.F. Sheldon found out about it and exhumed the bodies for dissection a few days later, outraging the mourning Potawatomi. About two weeks later some Potawatomi returned the keg to Goodwin and tried to retrieve Negnaska's rifle, but Goodwin pretended not to know the man had been killed and refused to release the rifle to his friends.<ref name=\"Winona History\">[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsteuben00inte/historyofsteuben00inte_djvu.txt ''History of Steuben County, Indiana''], Chicago: Inter-state Publishing

She spent part of her childhood in Europe, as her father served a tour of duty with the Air Force there. Austin studied dancing at [[California State University, Sacramento|Sacramento State College]], and found work with the Tony Martin nightclub act upon arriving in Hollywood.<ref name=\"glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/521/Pamela+Austin/index.html|title=Pamela Austin profile|publisher=glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nNatalia aka BEANBEAR loves her brother Diego so much and this is Wikipedia so it must be true right TALIA??? <3\n\n\nIn addition to appearing in two [[Elvis Presley]] films, in 1965-1967 Austin gained fame for a long series of popular automobile television commercials (and print ads) for [[Dodge]] (the [[Dodge Charger|Charger]], [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], [[Dodge Polara|Polara]], and other models). As the perky \"Dodge Rebellion Girl\", she appeared in around twenty commercials as a [[damsel in distress]] \u2014 menaced by sharks, falling from a draw-bridge, a roof, a cargo plane, etc. Her tag line at the end of each ad was \"The Dodge Rebellion wants you!\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe ad series led to numerous film and television offers and a three-page profile in ''[[TV Guide]]'' (August 20\u201326, 1966). By 1968, Dodge executives felt Austin's popularity was overshadowing the cars and began a new \"Dodge Fever\" campaign with a different model, Joan Anita Parker.\n\nIn August 1967 she starred in the adventure-comedy film ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1967 film)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' based on the silent [[cliff-hanger]] [[Serial film|serial]].

As the perky \"Dodge Rebellion Girl\", she appeared in around twenty commercials as a [[damsel in distress]] \u2014 menaced by sharks, falling from a draw-bridge, a roof, a cargo plane, etc. Her tag line at the end of each ad was \"The Dodge Rebellion wants you!\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe ad series led to numerous film and television offers and a three-page profile in ''[[TV Guide]]'' (August 20\u201326, 1966).

It is a climbing vine, attaching itself to supports using [[tendril]]s. The serrated leaflets commonly grow in groups of five (as in ''G. pentaphyllum'') although some species can have groups of three or seven leaflets. The plant is [[dioecious]], meaning each plant exists either as male or female. Therefore, if seeds are desired, both a male and female plant must be grown.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n<!--Detail here when and how the species was discovered or first circumscribed.

The plant was first described in 1406 CE by [[Zhu Xiao]], who presented a description and sketch in the book ''Materia Medica for Famine'' as a [[survival food]] rather than a medicinal herb.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheng JG, etal |title=Investigation of the plant jiaogulan and its analogous herb, Wulianmei |journal=Zhong Cao Yao |year=1990 |volume=21|issue=9|pages=424}}</ref> The earliest record of jiaogulan's use as a drug comes from herbalist [[Li Shizhen]]'s book ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' published in 1578, identifying jiaogulan for treating various ailments such as [[hematuria]], [[edema]] in the pharynx and neck, [[Neoplasm|tumors]], and [[Major trauma|trauma]]. While Li Shizhen had confused jiaogulan with an analogous herb [[Wulianmei]], in 1848 [[Wu Qi-Jun]] rectified this confusion in ''Textual Investigation of Herbal Plants''.\n\nModern recognition of the plant outside of China originated from research in [[sugar substitute]]s.<ref name=drugs/> In the 1970s, while analyzing the sweet component of the jiaogulan plant (known as ''amachazuru'' in Japan), [[Masahiro Nagai]] discovered [[saponin]]s identical to those in ''Panax ginseng''.<ref>{{cite conference |url= |title=Abstracts of Papers, 23d Meeting of the Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy |last1=Nagai |first1=Masahiro |date=November 1976 |publisher=Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy |pages=37 |location= |id= }}</ref> Continued research has described several more saponins ([[gypenoside]]s) comparable or identical to those found in ginseng.<ref name=\"drugs\" /> ''Panax ginseng'' contains [[ginsenoside]]s while [[gypenoside]] saponins have been found in jiaogulan.<ref name=\"drugs\" />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''G. pentaphyllum'' is one of about 17 species in the genus ''Gynostemma'', including nine species [[endemic]] to China.<ref name=FoC-genus/> However, ''G. pentaphyllum'' has a wide distribution outside of China, ranging from India and Bangladesh to Southeast Asia to Japan and Korea as well as to New Guinea.<ref name=FoC-species/> In China, it grows in forests, thickets, and roadsides on mountain slopes at elevations of {{convert|300|\u2013|3200|m|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]].<ref name=FoC-species/>\n\nJiaogulan is a vine hardy to [[Hardiness zone|USDA zone]] 8 in which it may grow as a short lived [[perennial plant]].<ref name=drugs/> It can be grown as an annual in most temperate climates, in well-drained soil with full sun. It does not grow well in cold climates with temperatures below freezing.<ref name=drugs/>\n\n<==Chemistry and toxicity==\nConstituents of ''G. pentaphyllum'' include [[sterol]]s, [[saponin]], [[flavonoid]]s, and [[chlorophyll]].<ref name=drugs/> [[Gypenoside]]s have been [[extract|extracted]] from its leaves.<ref name=drugs/> Some saponin compounds are the same as those found in [[ginseng]] roots.<ref name=drugs/>Severe nausea and increased bowel movements have been reported; however, a clinical trial using jiaogulan tea 6 g/day reported no adverse effects <ref name=drugs/>\n<ref name=anticancer>\nGynostemma pnetaphyllum has been investigated extensively as a potent anti-cancer agent against many types of cancers both in vitro and in vivo. <ref name=anticancer/>\n\n==Uses==\nThe plant is used in folk medicine, typically as an [[herbal tea]], but may be used as an [[tincture|alcohol extract]] or in [[dietary supplement]]s.

The serrated leaflets commonly grow in groups of five (as in ''G. pentaphyllum'') although some species can have groups of three or seven leaflets. The plant is [[dioecious]], meaning each plant exists either as male or female. Therefore, if seeds are desired, both a male and female plant must be grown.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n<!--Detail here when and how the species was discovered or first circumscribed.
