Marxist\u2013Leninists espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of [[orthodox Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], but they generally support the idea of a [[vanguard party]], a [[communist party]]-[[One-party state|led state]], [[State socialism|state-dominance over the economy]],<ref name=\"Andrain\">Andrai, Charles F.

It rejected the common notions among Marxists at the time of [[world revolution]] as a prerequisite for building socialism in Russia in favour of the concept of [[socialism in one country]]. According to its supporters, the gradual transition from capitalism to socialism was signified with the introduction of the [[first five-year plan]] and the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]]. The internationalism of Marxism\u2013Leninism was expressed in supporting revolutions in foreign countries (e.g. initially through the Communist International or through the concept of [[socialist-leaning countries]] after [[de-Stalinisation]]). By the late 1920s, Stalin established ideological orthodoxy among the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]], the Soviet Union and the Communist International to establish universal Marxist\u2013Leninist praxis.<ref>Bullock, Allan; Trombley, Stephen, eds.

The claim that Mao had adapted Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole. Consequently, Mao Zedong Thought became the official [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|state ideology]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] as well as the ideological basis of communist parties around the world which sympathised with China.<ref name=\"Modern Thought 1999 p. 501\">Bullock, Allan; Trombley, Stephen, eds.

The Sino-Albanian split was caused by [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]]'s rejection of China's ''[[Realpolitik]]'' of Sino\u2013American rapprochement, specifically the [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 Mao\u2013Nixon meeting]] which the [[anti-revisionist]] Albanian Labor Party perceived as an ideological betrayal of Mao's own [[Three Worlds Theory]] that excluded such political rapprochement with the West. To the Albanian Marxist\u2013Leninists, the Chinese dealings with the United States indicated Mao's lessened, practical commitments to ideological orthodoxy and [[proletarian internationalism]]. In response to Mao's apparently unorthodox deviations, [[Enver Hoxha]], head of the Albanian Labor Party, theorised anti-revisionist Marxism\u2013Leninism, referred to as [[Hoxhaism]], that retained orthodox Marxism\u2013Leninism when compared to the ideology of the post-Stalin Soviet Union.\n\nIn [[North Korea]], Marxism\u2013Leninism was officially superseded in 1977 by ''[[Juche]]''. However, the government is still sometimes referred to as Marxist\u2013Leninist, or more commonly as Stalinist, due to its political and economic structure. In the other four existing Marxist\u2013Leninist [[socialist state]]s, namely China, [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]], the ruling parties hold Marxism\u2013Leninism as their official ideology, although they give it different interpretations in terms of practical policy. Marxism\u2013Leninism remains the ideology of mostly anti-revisionist Stalinist, Maoist and Hoxhaist as well as some de-Stalinised or reformed non-ruling communist parties worldwide.

Later in the [[October Revolution]], the Bolshevik's seizure of power against the Provisional Government resulted in their establishment of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (1917\u20131991), yet parts of Russia remained occupied by the counter-revolutionary [[White Movement]] of anti-communists who had united to form the [[White Army]] to fight the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917\u20131922) against the Bolshevik government.

To overcome the lack of educated Russians who could operate and administrate industry, Lenin advocated the development of a [[Intelligentsia|technical intelligentsia]] who would propel the industrial development of Russia to self-sufficiency.<ref name=\"massaschussetts2\"/>\n\n=== Stalin's rise to power (1922\u20131928) ===\n[[File:Vladimir Lenin on the front page of Projector (Spotlight) issue 15 dated 15 Sep 1923.jpg|thumb|left|At his death on 21 January 1924, Lenin's [[Lenin's Testament|political testament]] ordered the removal of Stalin as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] because of his abusive personality]]\nAs he neared death after suffering strokes, [[Lenin's Testament]] (December 1922) named Trotsky and Stalin as the most able men in the Central Committee, but he harshly criticised them. Lenin said that Stalin should be removed from being the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the party and that he be replaced with \"some other person

ideological integrity of the party was Trotsky, who was a personally charismatic political leader as well as the commanding officer of the [[Red Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] and revolutionary partner of the dead Lenin.<ref name=\"dictatorships5\"/> To thwart Trotsky's likely election to head the party, Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev formed a [[triumvirate|troika]] that featured Stalin as General Secretary, the ''de facto'' [[Power (social and political)|centre of power]] in the party and the country.<ref name=\"dictatorships6\">Lee, p. 42.</ref> The direction of the party was decided in confrontations of politics and personality between Stalin's troika and Trotsky over which Marxist policy to pursue, either Trotsky's policy of [[permanent revolution]] or Stalin's policy of [[socialism in one country]].<ref name=\"dictatorships6\"/> Trotsky's permanent revolution advocated rapid industrialisation, elimination of private farming and having the Soviet Union promote the spread of communist revolution abroad.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\">Lee, p. 43.</ref> Stalin's socialism in one country stressed moderation and development of positive relations between the Soviet Union and other countries to increase trade and foreign investment.<ref name=\"dictatorships6\"/> To politically isolate and oust Trotsky from the party, Stalin expediently advocated socialism in one country, a policy to which he was indifferent.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/> In 1925, the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] chose Stalin's policy, defeating Trotsky as a possible leader of the party and of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/>\n\nIn the 1925\u20131927 period, Stalin dissolved the troika and disowned the [[Centrist Marxism|centrist]] Kamenev and Zinoviev for an expedient alliance with the three most [[Right Opposition|right-wing]] from the Bolshevik period, namely [[Alexei Rykov]] (Premier of Russia, 1924\u20131929; Premier of the Soviet

Stalin politically controlled the party and the Soviet Union by way of deception and administrative acumen.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/> In that time, Stalin's centralised, socialism in one country r\u00e9gime had negatively associated Lenin's revolutionary [[Bolshevism]] with Stalinism, i.e. government by command-policy to realise projects such as the rapid industrialisation of cities and the collectivisation of agriculture.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1991\"/> Such Stalinism also subordinated the interests (political, national and ideological) of Asian and European communist parties to the geopolitical interests of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1991\"/>\n\nIn the 1928\u20131932 period of the [[first five-year plan]], Stalin affected the [[dekulakization]] of the farmlands of the Soviet Union, a politically radical dispossession of the [[kulak]] class of peasant-landlords from the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] social order of monarchy.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/> As [[Old Bolshevik]] revolutionaries, Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky recommended amelioration of the dekulakization to lessen the negative social impact in the relations between the Soviet peoples and the party, but Stalin took umbrage and then accused them of uncommunist philosophical deviations from Lenin and Marx.<ref>{{cite

the appearance of impropriety then compelled the resignations of the Old Bolsheviks from government and from the Politburo.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/> Stalin then completed his political purging of the party by exiling Trotsky from the Soviet Union in 1929.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/> Afterwards, the political opposition to the practical r\u00e9gime of Stalinism was denounced as [[Trotskyism]] (Bolshevik\u2013Leninism), described as a deviation from Marxism\u2013Leninism, the state ideology of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1991\"/>\n\nPolitical developments in the Soviet Union included Stalin dismantling the remaining elements of democracy from the party by extending his control over its institutions and eliminating any possible rivals.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\">Lee, p. 49.</ref> The party's ranks grew in numbers, with the party modifying its organisation to include more trade unions and factories.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/> The ranks and files of the party were populated with members from the trade unions and the factories, whom Stalin controlled because there were no other Old Bolsheviks to contradict Marxism\u2013Leninism.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\">Lee, p. 49.</ref> In the late 1930s, the Soviet Union adopted the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] which ended weighted-voting preferences for workers, promulgated [[universal suffrage]] for every man and woman older than 18 years of age and organised the soviets (councils of workers) into two legislatures, namely the [[Soviet of the Union]] (representing electoral districts) and the [[Soviet of Nationalities]] (representing the ethnic groups of the country).<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/> By 1939, with the exception of Stalin himself, none of the original Bolsheviks of the October Revolution of 1917 remained in the party.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/> Unquestioning loyalty to Stalin was expected by the regime of all citizens.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/>\n\nStalin exercised extensive personal control over the party and unleashed an unprecedented level of violence to eliminate any potential threat to his regime.<ref name=\"dictatorships8\">Lee, p. 47.</ref> While Stalin exercised major control over political initiatives, their implementation was in the control of localities, often with local leaders interpreting the policies in a way that served themselves best.<ref name=\"dictatorships8\"/> This abuse of power by local leaders exacerbated the violent purges and terror campaigns carried out by Stalin against members of the party deemed to be traitors.<ref name=\"dictatorships8\"/> With the [[Great Purge]] (1936\u20131938), Stalin rid himself of internal enemies in the party and rid the Soviet Union of any alleged socially dangerous and counterrevolutionary person who might have offered legitimate political opposition to Marxism\u2013Leninism.<ref name=\"Pons p. 447\">Pons, p. 447.</ref>\n\nStalin allowed the secret police [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) to rise above the law and the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] (State Political Directorate) to use [[political violence]] to eliminate any person who might be a threat, whether real, potential, or imagined. As an administrator, Stalin governed the Soviet Union by controlling the formulation of national policy, but he delegated implementation to subordinate functionaries. Such freedom of action allowed local communist functionaries much discretion to interpret the intent of orders from Moscow, but this allowed their corruption. To Stalin, the correction of such abuses of authority and economic corruption were responsibility of the NKVD. In the 1937\u20131938 period, the NKVD arrested 1.5 million people, purged from every stratum of Soviet society and every rank and file of the party, of which 681,692 people were killed as [[Enemy of the state|enemies of the state]].<ref name=\"dictatorships8\"/> To provide manpower (manual, intellectual and technical) to realise the construction of socialism in one country, the NKVD established the [[Gulag]] system of [[Forced labour|forced-labour]] camps for regular criminals and political dissidents, for culturally insubordinate artists and politically incorrect intellectuals and for homosexual people and religious [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]].<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/>\n\n=== Socialism in one country (1928\u20131945) ===\n{{Stalinism sidebar}}\nBeginning in 1928, Stalin's [[five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union]] achieved the rapid industrialisation (coal, iron and steel, electricity and petroleum, among others) and the collectivisation of agriculture.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/><ref>Hobsbawm, Eric (1996).

The five-year plans were prepared in the 1920s whilst the Bolshevik government fought the internal Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922) and repelled the external Allied intervention to the Russian Civil War (1918\u20131925). Vast industrialisation was initiated mostly based with a focus on [[heavy industry]].<ref>Lee, p. 59.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R85625, Sowjetunion, H\u00fcttenkombinat in Magnitogorsk.jpg|thumb|left|A 1929 metallurgical combine in [[Magnitogorsk]] demonstrates the Soviet Union's [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)#Rapid industrialization|rapid industrialisation]] in the 1920s and 1930s]]\nDuring the 1930s, the rapid industrialisation of the country accelerated the Soviet people's sociological transition from poverty to relative plenty when politically illiterate peasants passed from Tsarist [[serfdom]] to self-determination and became politically aware urban citizens.<ref name=\"dictatorships11\">Lee, p. 62.</ref> The Marxist\u2013Leninist economic r\u00e9gime modernised Russia from the illiterate, peasant society characteristic of monarchy to the [[Literacy|literate]], socialist society of educated farmers and industrial workers.

Under Lenin, the education system allowed relaxed discipline in schools that became based upon Marxist theory, but Stalin reversed this in 1934 with a conservative approach taken with the reintroduction of formal learning, the use of examinations and grades, the assertion of full authority of the teacher and the introduction of school uniforms.<ref name=\"dictatorships10\"/> Art and culture became strictly regulated under the principles of [[socialist realism]] and Russian traditions that Stalin admired were allowed to continue.<ref name=\"dictatorships10\"/>\n\nForeign policy in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1941 resulted in substantial changes in the Soviet Union's approach to its foreign policy.<ref>Lee, p. 73.</ref> In 1933, the Marxist\u2013Leninist geopolitical perspective was that the Soviet Union was surrounded by capitalist and anti-communist enemies. As a result, the election of [[Adolf Hitler]] and his [[Nazi Party]] government in Germany initially caused the Soviet Union to sever diplomatic relations that had been established in the 1920s. In 1938, Stalin accommodated the Nazis and the anti-communist West by not defending Czechoslovakia, allowing Hitler's threat of pre-emptive war for the [[Sudetenland]] to annex the land and \"rescue the oppressed German peoples\" living in Czecho.<ref name=\"dictatorships12\">Lee, p. 74.</ref>\n\nTo challenge [[Nazi Germany]]'s bid for European empire and hegemony, Stalin promoted [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] front organisations to encourage European socialists and democrats to join the Soviet communists to fight throughout Nazi-occupied Europe, creating agreements with France to challenge Germany.<ref name=\"dictatorships12\"/> After Germany and Britain signed the [[Munich Agreement]] (29 September 1938) which allowed the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938\u20131945), Stalin adopted pro-German policies for the Soviet Union's dealings with Nazi Germany.<ref name=\"dictatorships12\"/> In 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany agreed to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, 23 August 1939) and to jointly [[Invasion of Poland|invade and partition Poland]], by way of which Nazi Germany started the Second World War (1 September 1939).<ref>Lee, pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn the 1941\u20131942 period of the [[Great Patriotic War]], the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] (Operation Barbarossa, 22 June 1941) was ineffectively opposed by the [[Red Army]], who were poorly led, ill-trained and under-equipped. As a result, they fought poorly and suffered great losses of soldiers (killed, wounded and captured). The weakness of the Red Army was partly consequence of the [[Great Purge]] (1936\u20131938) of senior officers and career soldiers whom Stalin considered politically unreliable.<ref name=\"dictatorships13\">Lee, p. 80.</ref> Strategically, the [[Wehrmacht]]'s extensive and effective attack threatened the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union, and the political integrity of Stalin's model of a Marxist\u2013Leninist state, when the Nazis were initially welcomed as liberators by the anti-communist and nationalist populations in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].\n\nThe anti-Soviet nationalists' [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the Nazi's lasted until the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' began their ''[[Lebensraum]]'' killings of the Jewish populations, the local communists, the civil and community leaders\u2014the [[Holocaust]] meant to realise the Nazi German colonisation of Bolshevik Russia. In response, Stalin ordered the Red Army to fight a [[total war]] against the Germanic invaders who would exterminate Slavic Russia. Hitler's attack against the Soviet Union (Nazi Germany's erstwhile ally) realigned Stalin's political priorities, from the repression of internal enemies to the existential defence against external attack. The pragmatic Stalin then entered the Soviet Union to the [[Allies of World War II|Grand Alliance]], a common front against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]]).\n\n[[File:Long-march.jpg|thumb|A [[Chinese Communist Party]] cadre-leader addresses survivors of the 1934\u20131935 [[Long March]]]]\nIn the continental European countries occupied by the [[Axis powers]], the native communist party usually led the armed resistance ([[guerrilla warfare]] and [[urban guerrilla warfare]]) against fascist military occupation. In Mediterranean Europe, the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]] led by [[Josip Broz Tito]] effectively resisted the German Nazi and Italian Fascist occupation. In the 1943\u20131944 period, the Yugoslav Partisans liberated territories with Red Army assistance and established the communist political authority that became the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. To end the Imperial Japanese occupation of China in continental Asia, Stalin ordered [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] to temporarily cease the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927\u20131949) against [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the anti-communist [[Kuomintang]] as the [[Second United Front]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945).\n\nIn 1943, the Red Army began to repel the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, especially at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (23 August 1942 \u2013 2 February 1943) and at the [[Battle of Kursk]] (5 July \u2013 23 August 1943). The Red Army then repelled the Nazi and Fascist occupation armies from Eastern Europe until the Red Army decisively defeated Nazi Germany in the [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation]] (16 April\u20132 May 1945).<ref name=\"dictatorships14\">Lee, p. 81.</ref> On concluding the Great Patriotic War (1941\u20131945), the Soviet Union was a military superpower with a say in determining the geopolitical order of the world.<ref name=\"dictatorships14\"/> In accordance with the three-power [[Yalta Agreement]] (4\u201311 February 1945), the Soviet Union purged [[Collaborationism|native fascist collaborators]] from the Eastern European countries occupied by the Axis Powers and installed native Communist governments.\n\n=== Cold War, de-Stalinisation and Maoism (1945\u20131980) ===\n[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|left|[[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D.

The renewed competition for geopolitical [[hegemony]] resulted in the bi-polar [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131991), a protracted state of tension (military and diplomatic) between the Unted States and the Sovet Union which often threatened a Soviet\u2013American [[nuclear war]], but it usually featured [[proxy war]]s in the Third World.<ref>Cook, Chris, ed.

In 1948, circumstance and cultural personality aggravated the matter into the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split|Yugoslav\u2013Soviet split]] (1948\u20131955) that resulted from Tito's rejection of Stalin's demand to subordinate the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] to the geopolitical agenda (economic and military) of the Soviet Union, i.e. Tito at Stalin's disposal. Stalin punished Tito's refusal by denouncing him as an ideological revisionist of Marxism\u2013Leninism; by denouncing Yugoslavia's practice of [[Titoism]] as socialism deviated from the cause of [[world communism]]; and by expelling the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] from the [[Communist Information Bureau]] (Cominform). The break from the Eastern Bloc allowed the development of a socialism with Yugoslav characteristics which allowed doing business with the capitalist West to develop the [[socialist economy]] and the establishment of Yugoslavia's diplomatic and commercial relations with countries of the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc. Yugoslavia's international relations matured into the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (1961) of countries without political allegiance to any [[power bloc]].\n\nAt the death of Stalin in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and then consolidated an anti-Stalinist government. In a secret meeting at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev denounced Stalin and [[Stalinism]] in the speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]'' (25 February 1956) in which he specified and condemned Stalin's dictatorial excesses and abuses of power such as the [[Great purge]] (1936\u20131938) and the [[cult of personality]]. Khrushchev introduced the [[de-Stalinisation]] of the party and of the Soviet Union. He realised this with the dismantling of the Gulag archipelago of forced-labour camps and freeing the prisoners as well as allowing Soviet civil society greater political freedom of expression, especially for public intellectuals of the [[intelligentsia]] such as the novelist [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], whose literature obliquely criticised Stalin and the Stalinist [[police state]]. De-Stalinization also ended Stalin's national-purpose policy of [[socialism in one country]] and was replaced with [[proletarian internationalism]], by way of which Khrushchev re-committed the Soviet Union to [[permanent revolution]] to realise [[world communism]]. In that geopolitical vein, Khrushchev presented de-Stalinization as the restoration of Leninism as the state ideology of the Soviet Union.<ref>Powaski, Ronald E. (1997).

To realise that leap of Marxist faith in the development of Chinese socialism, the Communist Party of China developed [[Maoism]] as the official state ideology. As the specifically Chinese development of Marxism\u2013Leninism, Maoism illuminated the cultural differences between the European-Russian and the Asian-Chinese interpretations and practical applications of Marxism\u2013Leninism in each country. The political differences then provoked geopolitical, ideological and nationalist tensions, which derived from the different stages of development, between the urban society of the industrialised Soviet Union and the agricultural society of the pre-industrial China. The theory versus praxis arguments escalated to theoretic disputes about Marxist\u2013Leninist revisionism and provoked the [[Sino-Soviet split]] (1956\u20131966) and the two countries broke their international relations (diplomatic, political, cultural and economic).<ref name=\"World History 2000. p. 769\"/>\n\nIn Eastern Asia, the Cold War produced the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), the first proxy war between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, resulted from dual origins, namely the nationalist Koreans' post-war resumption of their [[Korean Civil War]] and the imperial war for regional hegemony sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>Kohn, George Childs, ed. (2007). ''Dictionary of Wars'' (3rd ed.). pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> The international response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea was realised by the [[United Nations Security Council]], who voted for war despite the absent Soviet Union and authorised an international military expedition to intervene, expel the northern invaders from the south of Korea and restore the geopolitical ''status quo ante'' of the Soviet and American [[division of Korea]] at the 38th Parallel of global latitude. Consequent to Chinese military intervention in behalf of North Korea, the magnitude of the [[infantry]] warfare reached operational and geographic [[stalemate]] (July 1951\u2013July 1953). Afterwards, the shooting war was ended with the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] (27 July 1953); and the superpower Cold War in Asia then resumed as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].\n\n[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|The [[Sino\u2013Soviet split]] facilitated Russian and Chinese rapprochement with the United States and expanded East\u2013West geopolitics into a tri-polar [[Cold War]] that allowed Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to meet with President [[John F.

Mao Zedong's pragmatism permitted geopolitical rapprochement and facilitated President [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China]] which subsequently ended the policy of the existence to [[Two Chinas]] when the United States sponsored the People's Republic of China to replace the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the representative of the Chinese people at the United Nations.

However, the CIA's unsuccessful [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] (17 April 1961) by anti-communist Cuban exiles impelled the Republic of Cuba to side with the Soviet Union in the geopolitics of the bipolar Cold War. The [[Cuban missile crisis]] (22\u201328 October 1962) occurred when the United States opposed Cuba being armed with nuclear missiles by the Soviet Union. After a stalemate confrontation, the United States and the Soviet Union jointly resolved the nuclear-missile crisis by respectively removing United States missiles from Turkey and Italy and Soviet missiles from Cuba.<ref>Cook, Chris, ed.

In Bolivia, this included Che Guevara as a leader until being killed there by government forces. In 1970, the [[October Crisis]] (5 October \u2013 28 December 1970) occurred in Canada, a brief revolution in the province of [[Quebec]], where the actions of the Marxist\u2013Leninist and separatist [[Quebec Liberation Front]] (FLQ) featured the kidnap of James Cross, the British Trade Commissioner in Canada; and the killing of [[Pierre Laporte]], the Quebec government minister. The political manifesto of the FLQ condemned English-Canadian imperialism in French Quebec and called for an independent, socialist Quebec. The Canadian government's harsh response included the suspension of civil liberties in Quebec and compelled the FLQ leaders' flight to Cuba. Uruguay faced Marxist\u2013Leninist revolution from the [[Tupamaros]] movement from the 1960s to the 1970s.\n\n[[File:Daniel Ortega (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Ortega]] led the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] to victory in the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] in 1990]]\nIn 1979, the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) led by [[Daniel Ortega]] won the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] (1961\u20131990) against the government of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] (1 December 1974 \u2013 17 July 1979) to establish a socialist Nicaragua.

In 1983, the [[United States invasion of Grenada]] (25\u201329 October 1983) thwarted the assumption of power by the elected government of the [[New Jewel Movement]] (1973\u20131983), a Marxist\u2013Leninist vanguard party led by [[Maurice Bishop]].\n\n[[File:Nlfmainforce.jpg|thumb|left|Guerrillas of the [[Viet Cong]] during the [[Vietnam War]]]]\nIn Asia, the [[Vietnam War]] (1945\u20131975) was the second East\u2013West war fought during the Cold War (1945\u20131991). In the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954), the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] defeated the French re-establishment of European colonialism in Vietnam.

On 30 January 1968, North Vietnam launched the [[Tet Offensive]] (the General Offensive and Uprising of Tet Mau Than, 1968). Although a military failure for the guerrillas and the army, it was a successful [[psychological warfare]] operation that decisively turned international public opinion against the United States intervention to the Vietnamese civil war, with the military withdrawal of the United States from Vietnam in 1973 and the subsequent and consequent [[Fall of Saigon]] to the North Vietnamese army on 30 April 1975.<ref>Kohn, George Childs, ed.

This included [[Kampuchea]] and [[Laos]]. Consequent to the [[Cambodian Civil War]] (1968\u20131975), a coalition composed of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] (1941\u20131955), the native Cambodian Marxist\u2013Leninists and the Maoist [[Khmer Rouge]] (1951\u20131999) led by [[Pol Pot]] established [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975\u20131982), a Marxist\u2013Leninist state that featured [[Class conflict|class warfare]] to restructure the society of old Cambodia and to be effected and realised with the abolishment of [[money]] and private property, the outlawing of religion, the killing of the [[intelligentsia]] and compulsory manual labour for the [[middle class]]es by way of death-squad [[state terrorism]].<ref>Bullock, Allan; Trombley, Stephen, eds.

[[Angola]], [[Benin]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]] [[Mozambique]], [[Somalia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] became Marxist\u2013Leninist states governed by their respective native peoples during the 1968\u20131980 period. Marxist\u2013Leninist guerrillas fought the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974) in three countries, namely Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique.<ref>Kohn, George Childs, ed. (2007). ''Dictionary of Wars'' (3rd ed.). pp. 25\u201326.</ref> In Ethiopia, a Marxist\u2013Leninist revolution deposed the monarchy of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] (1930\u20131974) and established the Derg government (1974\u20131987) of the [[Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia]]. In [[Rhodesia]] (1965\u20131979), [[Robert Mugabe]] led the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Zimbabwe War of Liberation]] (1964\u20131979) that deposed white-minority rule and then established the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nIn [[Apartheid South Africa]] (1948\u20131994), the Afrikaner government of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist Party]] caused much geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union because of the Afrikaners' violent social control and political repression of the black and coloured populations of South Africa exercised under the guise of anti-communism and national security. The Soviet Union officially supported the overthrow of apartheid while the West and the United States in particular maintained official neutrality on the matter. In the 1976\u20131977 period of the Cold War, the United States and other Western countries found it morally untenable to politically support Apartheid South Africa, especially when the [[Afrikaner]] government killed 176 people (students and adults) in the police suppression of the [[Soweto uprising]] (June 1976), a political protest against Afrikaner [[cultural imperialism]] upon the non-white peoples of South Africa, specifically the imposition of the Germanic language of [[Afrikaans]] as the [[standard language]] for education which black South Africans were required to speak when addressing white people and Afrikaners; and the police assassination of [[Steven Biko]] (September 1977), a politically moderate leader of the [[internal resistance to apartheid]] in South Africa.<ref>Cook, Chris, ed. (1998). ''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' (2nd ed.). pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nUnder President [[Jimmy Carter]], the West joined the Soviet Union and others in enacting sanctions against weapons trade and weapons-grade material to South Africa. However, forceful actions by the United States against Apartheid South Africa were diminished under President Reagan as the [[Reagan administration]] feared the rise of revolution in South Africa as had happened in Zimbabwe against white minority rule. In 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan to establish a Marxist\u2013Leninist state, although the act was seen as an invasion by the West which responded to the Soviet military actions by boycotting the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics of 1980]] and providing clandestine support to the [[Mujahideen]], including [[Osama bin Laden]], as a means to challenge the Soviet Union. The war became a Soviet equivalent of the Vietnam War to the United States and it remained a stalemate throughout the 1980s.\n\n=== Reform and collapse (1980\u20131992) ===\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to end the Cold War between the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] and the United States-led [[NATO]] and other its other Western allies, in a meeting with President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nSocial resistance to the policies of Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes in Eastern Europe accelerated in strength with the rise of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], the first non-Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled trade union in the Warsaw Pact that was formed in the [[People's Republic of Poland]] in 1980.\n\nIn 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] rose to power in the Soviet Union and began policies of radical political reform involving political liberalisation, called [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Gorbachev's policies were designed at dismantling authoritarian elements of the state that were developed by Stalin, aiming for a return to a supposed ideal Leninist state that retained one-party structure while allowing the democratic election of competing candidates within the party for political office. Gorbachev also aimed to seek d\u00e9tente with the West and end the Cold War that was no longer economically sustainable to be pursued by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and the United States under President [[George H. W. Bush]] joined in pushing for the dismantlement of apartheid and oversaw the dismantlement of South African colonial rule over [[Namibia]].\n\n[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989]]\nMeanwhile, the eastern European Marxist\u2013Leninist states politically deteriorated in response to the success of the Polish Solidarity movement and the possibility of Gorbachev-style political liberalisation. In 1989, revolts began across Eastern Europe and China against Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes. In China, the government refused to negotiate with student protestors, resulting in the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square attacks]] that stopped the revolts by force. The revolts culminated with the revolt in [[East Germany]] against the Marxist\u2013Leninist regime of [[Erich Honecker]] and demands for the [[Berlin Wall]] to be torn down. The event in East Germany developed into a popular mass revolt with sections of the Berlin Wall being torn down and East and West Berliners uniting. Gorbachev's refusal to use Soviet forces based in East Germany to suppress the revolt was seen as a sign that the Cold War had ended. Honecker was pressured to resign from office and the new government committed itself to reunification with West Germany. The Marxist\u2013Leninist regime of [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was forcefully overthrown in 1989 and Ceau\u0219escu was executed. The other Warsaw Pact regimes also fell during the [[Revolutions of 1989]], with the exception of the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]] that continued until 1992.\n\nUnrest and eventual collapse of Marxism\u2013Leninism also occurred in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], although for different reasons than those of the Warsaw Pact. The death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in 1980 and the subsequent vacuum of strong leadership allowed the rise of rival ethnic nationalism in the multinational country. The first leader to exploit such nationalism for political purposes was [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], who used it to seize power as [[president of Serbia]] and demanded concessions to Serbia and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbs]] by the other republics in the Yugoslav federation. This resulted in a surge of [[Slovene nationalism|Slovene]] and [[Croatian nationalism|Croat]] nationalism in response and the collapse of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1990, the victory of nationalists in multi-party elections in most of Yugoslavia's constituent republics and eventually [[Yugoslav Wars|civil war between the various nationalities]] beginning in 1991. Yugoslavia was dissolved in 1992.\n\nThe Soviet Union itself collapsed between 1990 and 1991, with a rise of secessionist nationalism and a political power dispute between Gorbachev and  [[Boris Yeltsin]], the new leader of the [[Russian Federation]]. With the Soviet Union collapsing, Gorbachev prepared the country to become a loose federation of independent states called the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Hardline Marxist\u2013Leninist leaders in the military reacted to Gorbachev's policies with the [[August Coup]] of 1991 in which hardline Marxist\u2013Leninist military leaders overthrew Gorbachev and seized control of the government. This regime only lasted briefly as widespread popular opposition erupted in street protests and refused to submit. Gorbachev was restored to power, but the various Soviet republics were now set for independence. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev officially announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union, ending the existence of the world's first Marxist\u2013Leninist-led state.\n\n=== Contemporary Marxism\u2013Leninism (1992\u2013present) ===\nSince the fall of the Eastern European Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes, the Soviet Union and a variety of African Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes, only a few Marxist\u2013Leninist parties remained in power. This include [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. Most Marxist\u2013Leninist communist parties outside of these nations have fared relatively poorly in elections. However, other parties have remained or became a [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation|relative strong]] force. This include [[Russia]], where the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] has remained a significant political force, winning the [[1995 Russian legislative election|1995 legislative election]], almost winning the [[1996 Russian presidential election|1996 presidential election]] and generally remaining the second most popular party. In [[Ukraine]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] has also exerted influence and governed the country after the [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1994 parliamentary election]] and again after the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2006 parliamentary election]]. However, the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2014 parliamentary election]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] resulted in the loss of its 32 members and no parliamentary representation.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html \"People's Front 0.33% ahead of Poroshenko Bloc with all ballots counted in Ukraine elections - CEC\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112000000/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html|date=12 November 2014}}.

In [[Cyprus]], [[Dimitris Christofias]] of [[AKEL]] won the [[2008 Cypriot presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. AKEL has consistently been the first and third most popular party, winning the [[1970 Cypriot legislative election|1970]], [[1981 Cypriot legislative election|1981]], [[2001 Cypriot legislative election|2001]] and [[2006 Cypriot legislative election|2006]] legislative elections. In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Portugal]], the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] have been the second and fourth most popular parties until the [[2017 Czech legislative election|2017]] and [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|2009]] legislative elections, respectively. Since 2017, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia supports the [[ANO 2011]]\u2013[[Czech Social Democratic Party|\u010cSSD]] [[Andrej Babi\u0161' Second Cabinet|minority government]] while the Portuguese Communist Party has provided [[confidence and supply]] along with the [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"]] and [[Left Bloc]] to the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist]] [[XXI Constitutional Government of Portugal|minority government]] from 2015 to 2019. In [[Greece]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]] has led an interim and later national unity government between 1989 and 1990, constantly remaining the third or fourth most popular party. In [[Moldova]], the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] won the [[2001 Moldovan parliamentary election|2001]], [[2005 Moldovan parliamentary election|2005]] and [[April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election|April 2009]] parliamentary elections. However, the April 2009 Moldovan elections results were [[April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests|protested]] and [[July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election|another round was held in July]], resulting in the formation of the [[Alliance for European Integration]]. Failing to elect the president, [[2010 Moldovan parliamentary election|new parliamentary elections were held in November 2010]] which resulted in roughly the same representation in the parliament. According to Ion Marandici, a Moldovan political scientist, the Party of Communists differs from those in other countries because it managed to appeal to the ethnic minorities and the anti-Romanian Moldovans. After tracing the adaptation strategy of the party, he found confirming evidence for five of the factors contributing to its electoral success, already mentioned in the theoretical literature on former Marxist\u2013Leninist parties, namely the economic situation, the weakness of the opponents, the electoral laws, the fragmentation of the political spectrum and the legacy of the old regime. However, Marandici identified seven additional explanatory factors at work in the Moldovan case, namely the foreign support for certain political parties, separatism, the appeal to the ethnic minorities, the alliance-building capacity, the reliance on the Soviet notion of the Moldovan identity, the state-building process and the control over a significant portion of the media. It is due to these seven additional factors that the party managed to consolidate and expand its constituency. In the [[post-Soviet states]], the Party of Communists are the only ones who have been in power for so long and did not change the name of the party.<ref>Marandici, Ion (23 April 2010).

The People's Republic of China has continued the agenda of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s 1980s reforms by initiating significant privatisation of the national economy. At the same time, no corresponding political liberalisation has occurred as happened in previous years to Eastern European countries. The [[Naxalite\u2013Maoist insurgency]] has continued between the governments of [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]] against various Marxist\u2013Leninist movements, having been unabated since the 1960s. In India, the [[Manmohan Singh]] government depended on the parliamentary support of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] which has led state governments in [[Kerala]], [[Tripura]] and [[West Bengal]]. The armed wing of the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] has been fighting a war against the government of India since 1967 and is still active in half the country. Maoist rebels in [[Nepal]] engaged in a [[Nepalese Civil War|civil war]] from 1996 to 2006 that managed to topple the monarchy there and create a republic. [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist)]] leader [[Man Mohan Adhikari]] briefly became [[List of prime ministers of Nepal|prime minister]] and national leader from 1994 to 1995 and the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist]] guerrilla leader [[Prachanda]] was elected prime minister by the [[Constituent Assembly of Nepal]] in 2008. Prachanda has since been deposed as prime minister, leading the Maoists, who consider Prachanda's removal to be unjust, to abandon their legalistic approach and return to their street actions and militancy and to lead sporadic [[general strike]]s using their substantial influence on the Nepalese labour movement. These actions have oscillated between mild and intense. In the [[Philippines]], the Maoist-oriented [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and its armed wing, the [[New People's Army]], have been waging [[Communist rebellion in the Philippines|armed revolution]] against the existing Philippine government since 1968 and is still experiencing a low-scale guerrilla insurgency.\n\nIn Africa, several Marxist\u2013Leninist states reformed themselves and maintained power. In [[South Africa]], the [[South African Communist Party]] is a member of the [[Tripartite alliance]] alongside the [[African National Congress]] and the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]]. The [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] is a pan-African, Marxist\u2013Leninist party founded in 2013 by expelled former president of the [[African National Congress Youth League]] [[Julius Malema]] and his allies. [[Sri Lanka]] has had Marxist\u2013Leninist ministers in their national governments. In [[Zimbabwe]], former President [[Robert Mugabe]] of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front]], the country's long standing leader, was a professed Marxist\u2013Leninist.<ref>Talbot, Stephen (27 June 2006).

That personal and societal emancipation from [[poverty]] (material necessity) would maximise individual liberty by enabling men and women to pursue their interests and innate talents (artistic, industrial and intellectual) whilst working by choice, without the economic coercion of poverty. In the [[communist society]] of upper-stage economic development, the elimination of alienating labour (mechanistic work) depends upon the developments of [[high technology]] that improve the means of production and the means of distribution. To meet the material needs of a socialist society, the state uses a [[planned economy]] to co-ordinate the [[means of production]] and of distribution to supply and deliver the goods and services required throughout society and the national economy. The state serves as a safeguard for the ownership and as the coordinator of production through a universal economic plan.<ref name=\"Pons p. 138\">Pons, p. 138.</ref>\n\nFor the purpose of reducing waste and increasing efficiency, scientific planning replaces [[market mechanism]]s and [[price mechanism]]s as the guiding principle of the economy.<ref name=\"Pons p. 138\"/> The state's huge purchasing power replaces the role of market forces, with [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] not being achieved through market forces but by economic planning based on scientific [[Program evaluation|assessment]].<ref name=\"Pons p. 139\">Pons, p. 139.</ref> The [[wages]] of the worker are determined according to the type of skills and the type of work he or she can perform within the national economy.<ref name=\"Pons p. 140\">Pons, p. 140.</ref> Moreover, the economic value of the goods and services produced is based upon their [[use value]] (as material objects) and not upon the [[Labor theory of value|cost of production]] (value) or the [[Marginal Utility|exchange value]] (marginal utility).

While socially utilised means of production are under public control, personal belongings or property of a personal nature that does not involve mass production of goods remains unaffected by the state.<ref name=\"Pons p. 140\"/>\n\nBecause Marxism\u2013Leninism has historically been the state ideology of countries who were economically undeveloped prior to [[socialist revolution]], or whose economies were nearly obliterated by war such as the [[German Democratic Republic]], the primary goal before achieving communism was the development of socialism in itself. Such was the case in the Soviet Union, where the economy was largely agrarian and urban industry was in a primitive stage. To develop socialism, the Soviet Union underwent [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union#Industrialization in practice|rapid industrialisation]] with pragmatic programs of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] that transplanted peasant populations to the cities, where they were educated and trained as [[industrial workers]] and then became the workforce of the new factories and industries. Likewise, the farmer populations worked the [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|system of collective farms]] to grow food to feed the industrial workers in the industrialised cities.

Extrapolating from five philosophical bases of Marxism, namely that human history is the history of [[class struggle]] between a ruling class and an exploited class; that capitalism creates antagonistic [[social class]]es, i.e. the [[bourgeois]] exploiters and the exploited [[proletariat]]; that capitalism employs [[nationalist]] [[war]] to further private economic expansion; that [[socialism]] is an economic system that voids social classes through [[public ownership]] of the means of production and so will eliminate the economic causes of war; and that once the state ([[Socialist state|socialist]] or [[Communist state|communist]]) withers away, so shall international relations wither away because they are projections of national economic forces, Lenin said that the capitalists' exhaustion of domestic sources of investment profit by way of price-fixing [[Trust (business)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s, then prompts the same capitalists to export [[investment capital]] to undeveloped countries to finance the [[exploitation of natural resources]] and the native populations and to create new markets. That the capitalists' control of national politics ensures the government's military safeguarding of colonial investments and the consequent imperial competition for economic supremacy provokes international wars to protect their national interests.<ref name=\"auto\">Evans, Graham; Newnham, Jeffrey, eds.

This is the philosophic opposite of the horizontal perspectives (country-to-country) of the [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal]] and the [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] approaches to international relations. Colonial imperialism is the inevitable consequence\u00a0in the course of economic relations among countries when the domestic price-fixing of [[Monopoly|monopoly capitalism]] has voided profitable competition in the capitalist homeland. The ideology of [[New Imperialism]], rationalised as a [[civilising mission]], allowed the exportation of high-profit investment capital to undeveloped countries with uneducated, native populations (sources of cheap labour), plentiful raw materials for exploitation (factors for manufacture) and a colonial market to consume the [[surplus production]], which the capitalist homeland cannot consume. The example is the European [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914) in which imperialism was safeguarded by the national military.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTo secure the economic and settler colonies, foreign sources of new capital-investment-profit, the imperialist state seeks either political or military control of the limited resources (natural and human).

The Sino-Albanian split was caused by [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]]'s rejection of China's ''[[Realpolitik]]'' of Sino\u2013American rapprochement, specifically the [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 Mao\u2013Nixon meeting]] which the [[anti-revisionist]] Albanian Labor Party perceived as an ideological betrayal of Mao\u2019s own [[Three Worlds Theory]] that excluded such political rapprochement with the West.

In Berlin, the German government and their [[Freikorps]] mercenaries fought and defeated the [[Spartacist uprising]] which began as a [[general strike]]. In Munich, the local Freikorps fought and defeated the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. In Hungary, the disorganised workers who had proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic were fought and defeated by the royal armies of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] as well as the army of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]]. These communist forces were soon crushed by anti-communist forces and attempts to create an international communist revolution failed.

To overcome the civil war's economic interruptions, the policy of [[War Communism]] (1918\u20131921), a [[regulated market]], state-controlled means of distribution and nationalisation of large-scale farms, was adopted to requisite and distribute grain in order to feed industrial workers in the cities whilst the Red Army was fighting the White Army's attempted restoration of the [[Romanov]] dynasty as [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchs]] of Russia.<ref name=\"dictatorships2\"/> Moreover, the politically unpopular forced grain-requisitions discouraged peasants from farming resulted in reduced harvests and food shortages that provoked labour strikes and food riots.

the appearance of impropriety then compelled the resignations of the Old Bolsheviks from government and from the Politburo.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/> Stalin then completed his political purging of the party by exiling Trotsky from the Soviet Union in 1929.<ref name=\"dictatorships7\"/> Afterwards, the political opposition to the practical r\u00e9gime of Stalinism was denounced as [[Trotskyism]] (Bolshevik\u2013Leninism), described as a deviation from Marxism\u2013Leninism, the state ideology of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1991\"/>\n\nPolitical developments in the Soviet Union included Stalin dismantling the remaining elements of democracy from the party by extending his control over its institutions and eliminating any possible rivals.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\">Lee, p. 49.</ref> The party's ranks grew in numbers, with the party modifying its organisation to include more trade unions and factories.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/> The ranks and files of the party were populated with members from the trade unions and the factories, whom Stalin controlled because there were no other Old Bolsheviks to contradict Marxism\u2013Leninism.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\">Lee, p. 49.</ref> In the late 1930s, the Soviet Union adopted the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] which ended weighted-voting preferences for workers, promulgated [[universal suffrage]] for every man and woman older than 18 years of age and organised the soviets (councils of workers) into two legislatures, namely the [[Soviet of the Union]] (representing electoral districts) and the [[Soviet of Nationalities]] (representing the ethnic groups of the country).<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/> By 1939, with the exception of Stalin himself, none of the original Bolsheviks of the October Revolution of 1917 remained in the party.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/> Unquestioning loyalty to Stalin was expected by the regime of all citizens.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/>\n\nStalin exercised extensive personal control over the party and unleashed an unprecedented level of violence to eliminate any potential threat to his regime.<ref name=\"dictatorships8\">Lee, p. 47.</ref> While Stalin exercised major control over political initiatives, their implementation was in the control of localities, often with local leaders interpreting the policies in a way that served themselves best.<ref name=\"dictatorships8\"/> This abuse of power by local leaders exacerbated the violent purges and terror campaigns carried out by Stalin against members of the party deemed to be traitors.<ref name=\"dictatorships8\"/> With the [[Great Purge]] (1936\u20131938), Stalin rid himself of internal enemies in the party and rid the Soviet Union of any alleged socially dangerous and counterrevolutionary person who might have offered legitimate political opposition to Marxism\u2013Leninism.<ref name=\"Pons p. 447\">Pons, p. 447.</ref>\n\nStalin allowed the secret police [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) to rise above the law and the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] (State Political Directorate) to use [[political violence]] to eliminate any person who might be a threat, whether real, potential, or imagined. As an administrator, Stalin governed the Soviet Union by controlling the formulation of national policy, but he delegated implementation to subordinate functionaries. Such freedom of action allowed local communist functionaries much discretion to interpret the intent of orders from Moscow, but this allowed their corruption. To Stalin, the correction of such abuses of authority and economic corruption were responsibility of the NKVD. In the 1937\u20131938 period, the NKVD arrested 1.5 million people, purged from every stratum of Soviet society and every rank and file of the party, of which 681,692 people were killed as [[Enemy of the state|enemies of the state]].<ref name=\"dictatorships8\"/> To provide manpower (manual, intellectual and technical) to realise the construction of socialism in one country, the NKVD established the [[Gulag]] system of [[Forced labour|forced-labour]] camps for regular criminals and political dissidents, for culturally insubordinate artists and politically incorrect intellectuals and for homosexual people and religious [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]].<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/>\n\n=== Socialism in one country (1928\u20131945) ===\n{{Stalinism sidebar}}\nBeginning in 1928, Stalin's [[five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union]] achieved the rapid industrialisation (coal, iron and steel, electricity and petroleum, among others) and the collectivisation of agriculture.<ref name=\"dictatorships9\"/><ref>Hobsbawm, Eric (1996).

The five-year plans were prepared in the 1920s whilst the Bolshevik government fought the internal Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922) and repelled the external Allied intervention to the Russian Civil War (1918\u20131925). Vast industrialisation was initiated mostly based with a focus on [[heavy industry]].<ref>Lee, p. 59.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R85625, Sowjetunion, H\u00fcttenkombinat in Magnitogorsk.jpg|thumb|left|A 1929 metallurgical combine in [[Magnitogorsk]] demonstrates the Soviet Union's [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)#Rapid industrialization|rapid industrialisation]] in the 1920s and 1930s]]\nDuring the 1930s, the rapid industrialisation of the country accelerated the Soviet people's sociological transition from poverty to relative plenty when politically illiterate peasants passed from Tsarist [[serfdom]] to self-determination and became politically aware urban citizens.<ref name=\"dictatorships11\">Lee, p. 62.</ref> The Marxist\u2013Leninist economic r\u00e9gime modernised Russia from the illiterate, peasant society characteristic of monarchy to the [[Literacy|literate]], socialist society of educated farmers and industrial workers.

Under Lenin, the education system allowed relaxed discipline in schools that became based upon Marxist theory, but Stalin reversed this in 1934 with a conservative approach taken with the reintroduction of formal learning, the use of examinations and grades, the assertion of full authority of the teacher and the introduction of school uniforms.<ref name=\"dictatorships10\"/> Art and culture became strictly regulated under the principles of [[socialist realism]] and Russian traditions that Stalin admired were allowed to continue.<ref name=\"dictatorships10\"/>\n\nForeign policy in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1941 resulted in substantial changes in the Soviet Union's approach to its foreign policy.<ref>Lee, p. 73.</ref> In 1933, the Marxist\u2013Leninist geopolitical perspective was that the Soviet Union was surrounded by capitalist and anti-communist enemies. As a result, the election of [[Adolf Hitler]] and his [[Nazi Party]] government in Germany initially caused the Soviet Union to sever diplomatic relations that had been established in the 1920s. In 1938, Stalin accommodated the Nazis and the anti-communist West by not defending Czechoslovakia, allowing Hitler's threat of pre-emptive war for the [[Sudetenland]] to annex the land and \"rescue the oppressed German peoples\" living in Czecho.<ref name=\"dictatorships12\">Lee, p. 74.</ref>\n\nTo challenge [[Nazi Germany]]'s bid for European empire and hegemony, Stalin promoted [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] front organisations to encourage European socialists and democrats to join the Soviet communists to fight throughout Nazi-occupied Europe, creating agreements with France to challenge Germany.<ref name=\"dictatorships12\"/> After Germany and Britain signed the [[Munich Agreement]] (29 September 1938) which allowed the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938\u20131945), Stalin adopted pro-German policies for the Soviet Union's dealings with Nazi Germany.<ref name=\"dictatorships12\"/> In 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany agreed to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, 23 August 1939) and to jointly [[Invasion of Poland|invade and partition Poland]], by way of which Nazi Germany started the Second World War (1 September 1939).<ref>Lee, pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn the 1941\u20131942 period of the [[Great Patriotic War]], the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] (Operation Barbarossa, 22 June 1941) was ineffectively opposed by the [[Red Army]], who were poorly led, ill-trained and under-equipped. As a result, they fought poorly and suffered great losses of soldiers (killed, wounded and captured). The weakness of the Red Army was partly consequence of the [[Great Purge]] (1936\u20131938) of senior officers and career soldiers whom Stalin considered politically unreliable.<ref name=\"dictatorships13\">Lee, p. 80.</ref> Strategically, the [[Wehrmacht]]'s extensive and effective attack threatened the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union, and the political integrity of Stalin's model of a Marxist\u2013Leninist state, when the Nazis were initially welcomed as liberators by the anti-communist and nationalist populations in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].\n\nThe anti-Soviet nationalists' [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the Nazi's lasted until the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' began their ''[[Lebensraum]]'' killings of the Jewish populations, the local communists, the civil and community leaders\u2014the [[Holocaust]] meant to realise the Nazi German colonisation of Bolshevik Russia. In response, Stalin ordered the Red Army to fight a [[total war]] against the Germanic invaders who would exterminate Slavic Russia. Hitler's attack against the Soviet Union (Nazi Germany's erstwhile ally) realigned Stalin's political priorities, from the repression of internal enemies to the existential defence against external attack. The pragmatic Stalin then entered the Soviet Union to the [[Allies of World War II|Grand Alliance]], a common front against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]]).\n\n[[File:Long-march.jpg|thumb|A [[Chinese Communist Party]] cadre-leader addresses survivors of the 1934\u20131935 [[Long March]]]]\nIn the continental European countries occupied by the [[Axis powers]], the native communist party usually led the armed resistance ([[guerrilla warfare]] and [[urban guerrilla warfare]]) against fascist military occupation. In Mediterranean Europe, the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]] led by [[Josip Broz Tito]] effectively resisted the German Nazi and Italian Fascist occupation. In the 1943\u20131944 period, the Yugoslav Partisans liberated territories with Red Army assistance and established the communist political authority that became the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. To end the Imperial Japanese occupation of China in continental Asia, Stalin ordered [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] to temporarily cease the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927\u20131949) against [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the anti-communist [[Kuomintang]] as the [[Second United Front]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945).\n\nIn 1943, the Red Army began to repel the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, especially at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (23 August 1942 \u2013 2 February 1943) and at the [[Battle of Kursk]] (5 July \u2013 23 August 1943). The Red Army then repelled the Nazi and Fascist occupation armies from Eastern Europe until the Red Army decisively defeated Nazi Germany in the [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation]] (16 April\u20132 May 1945).<ref name=\"dictatorships14\">Lee, p. 81.</ref> On concluding the Great Patriotic War (1941\u20131945), the Soviet Union was a military superpower with a say in determining the geopolitical order of the world.<ref name=\"dictatorships14\"/> In accordance with the three-power [[Yalta Agreement]] (4\u201311 February 1945), the Soviet Union purged [[Collaborationism|native fascist collaborators]] from the Eastern European countries occupied by the Axis Powers and installed native Communist governments.\n\n=== Cold War, de-Stalinisation and Maoism (1945\u20131980) ===\n[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|left|[[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D.

The renewed competition for geopolitical [[hegemony]] resulted in the bi-polar [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131991), a protracted state of tension (military and diplomatic) between the Unted States and the Sovet Union which often threatened a Soviet\u2013American [[nuclear war]], but it usually featured [[proxy war]]s in the Third World.<ref>Cook, Chris, ed.

In 1948, circumstance and cultural personality aggravated the matter into the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split|Yugoslav\u2013Soviet split]] (1948\u20131955) that resulted from Tito's rejection of Stalin's demand to subordinate the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] to the geopolitical agenda (economic and military) of the Soviet Union, i.e. Tito at Stalin's disposal. Stalin punished Tito's refusal by denouncing him as an ideological revisionist of Marxism\u2013Leninism; by denouncing Yugoslavia's practice of [[Titoism]] as socialism deviated from the cause of [[world communism]]; and by expelling the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] from the [[Communist Information Bureau]] (Cominform). The break from the Eastern Bloc allowed the development of a socialism with Yugoslav characteristics which allowed doing business with the capitalist West to develop the [[socialist economy]] and the establishment of Yugoslavia's diplomatic and commercial relations with countries of the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc. Yugoslavia's international relations matured into the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (1961) of countries without political allegiance to any [[power bloc]].\n\nAt the death of Stalin in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and then consolidated an anti-Stalinist government. In a secret meeting at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev denounced Stalin and [[Stalinism]] in the speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]'' (25 February 1956) in which he specified and condemned Stalin's dictatorial excesses and abuses of power such as the [[Great purge]] (1936\u20131938) and the [[cult of personality]]. Khrushchev introduced the [[de-Stalinisation]] of the party and of the Soviet Union. He realised this with the dismantling of the Gulag archipelago of forced-labour camps and freeing the prisoners as well as allowing Soviet civil society greater political freedom of expression, especially for public intellectuals of the [[intelligentsia]] such as the novelist [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], whose literature obliquely criticised Stalin and the Stalinist [[police state]]. De-Stalinization also ended Stalin's national-purpose policy of [[socialism in one country]] and was replaced with [[proletarian internationalism]], by way of which Khrushchev re-committed the Soviet Union to [[permanent revolution]] to realise [[world communism]]. In that geopolitical vein, Khrushchev presented de-Stalinization as the restoration of Leninism as the state ideology of the Soviet Union.<ref>Powaski, Ronald E. (1997).

To realise that leap of Marxist faith in the development of Chinese socialism, the Communist Party of China developed [[Maoism]] as the official state ideology. As the specifically Chinese development of Marxism\u2013Leninism, Maoism illuminated the cultural differences between the European-Russian and the Asian-Chinese interpretations and practical applications of Marxism\u2013Leninism in each country. The political differences then provoked geopolitical, ideological and nationalist tensions, which derived from the different stages of development, between the urban society of the industrialised Soviet Union and the agricultural society of the pre-industrial China. The theory versus praxis arguments escalated to theoretic disputes about Marxist\u2013Leninist revisionism and provoked the [[Sino-Soviet split]] (1956\u20131966) and the two countries broke their international relations (diplomatic, political, cultural and economic).<ref name=\"World History 2000. p. 769\"/>\n\nIn Eastern Asia, the Cold War produced the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), the first proxy war between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, resulted from dual origins, namely the nationalist Koreans' post-war resumption of their [[Korean Civil War]] and the imperial war for regional hegemony sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>Kohn, George Childs, ed. (2007). ''Dictionary of Wars'' (3rd ed.). pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> The international response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea was realised by the [[United Nations Security Council]], who voted for war despite the absent Soviet Union and authorised an international military expedition to intervene, expel the northern invaders from the south of Korea and restore the geopolitical ''status quo ante'' of the Soviet and American [[division of Korea]] at the 38th Parallel of global latitude. Consequent to Chinese military intervention in behalf of North Korea, the magnitude of the [[infantry]] warfare reached operational and geographic [[stalemate]] (July 1951\u2013July 1953). Afterwards, the shooting war was ended with the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] (27 July 1953); and the superpower Cold War in Asia then resumed as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].\n\n[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|The [[Sino\u2013Soviet split]] facilitated Russian and Chinese rapprochement with the United States and expanded East\u2013West geopolitics into a tri-polar [[Cold War]] that allowed Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to meet with President [[John F.

Mao Zedong's pragmatism permitted geopolitical rapprochement and facilitated President [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China]] which subsequently ended the policy of the existence to [[Two Chinas]] when the United States sponsored the People's Republic of China to replace the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the representative of the Chinese people at the United Nations.

However, the CIA's unsuccessful [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] (17 April 1961) by anti-communist Cuban exiles impelled the Republic of Cuba to side with the Soviet Union in the geopolitics of the bipolar Cold War. The [[Cuban missile crisis]] (22\u201328 October 1962) occurred when the United States opposed Cuba being armed with nuclear missiles by the Soviet Union.

The political manifesto of the FLQ condemned English-Canadian imperialism in French Quebec and called for an independent, socialist Quebec. The Canadian government's harsh response included the suspension of civil liberties in Quebec and compelled the FLQ leaders' flight to Cuba.

[[Angola]], [[Benin]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]] [[Mozambique]], [[Somalia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] became Marxist\u2013Leninist states governed by their respective native peoples during the 1968\u20131980 period. Marxist\u2013Leninist guerrillas fought the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974) in three countries, namely Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique.<ref>Kohn, George Childs, ed. (2007). ''Dictionary of Wars'' (3rd ed.). pp. 25\u201326.</ref> In Ethiopia, a Marxist\u2013Leninist revolution deposed the monarchy of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] (1930\u20131974) and established the Derg government (1974\u20131987) of the [[Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia]]. In [[Rhodesia]] (1965\u20131979), [[Robert Mugabe]] led the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Zimbabwe War of Liberation]] (1964\u20131979) that deposed white-minority rule and then established the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nIn [[Apartheid South Africa]] (1948\u20131994), the Afrikaner government of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist Party]] caused much geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union because of the Afrikaners' violent social control and political repression of the black and coloured populations of South Africa exercised under the guise of anti-communism and national security. The Soviet Union officially supported the overthrow of apartheid while the West and the United States in particular maintained official neutrality on the matter. In the 1976\u20131977 period of the Cold War, the United States and other Western countries found it morally untenable to politically support Apartheid South Africa, especially when the [[Afrikaner]] government killed 176 people (students and adults) in the police suppression of the [[Soweto uprising]] (June 1976), a political protest against Afrikaner [[cultural imperialism]] upon the non-white peoples of South Africa, specifically the imposition of the Germanic language of [[Afrikaans]] as the [[standard language]] for education which black South Africans were required to speak when addressing white people and Afrikaners; and the police assassination of [[Steven Biko]] (September 1977), a politically moderate leader of the [[internal resistance to apartheid]] in South Africa.<ref>Cook, Chris, ed. (1998). ''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' (2nd ed.). pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nUnder President [[Jimmy Carter]], the West joined the Soviet Union and others in enacting sanctions against weapons trade and weapons-grade material to South Africa. However, forceful actions by the United States against Apartheid South Africa were diminished under President Reagan as the [[Reagan administration]] feared the rise of revolution in South Africa as had happened in Zimbabwe against white minority rule. In 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan to establish a Marxist\u2013Leninist state, although the act was seen as an invasion by the West which responded to the Soviet military actions by boycotting the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics of 1980]] and providing clandestine support to the [[Mujahideen]], including [[Osama bin Laden]], as a means to challenge the Soviet Union. The war became a Soviet equivalent of the Vietnam War to the United States and it remained a stalemate throughout the 1980s.\n\n=== Reform and collapse (1980\u20131992) ===\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to end the Cold War between the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] and the United States-led [[NATO]] and other its other Western allies, in a meeting with President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nSocial resistance to the policies of Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes in Eastern Europe accelerated in strength with the rise of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], the first non-Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled trade union in the Warsaw Pact that was formed in the [[People's Republic of Poland]] in 1980.\n\nIn 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] rose to power in the Soviet Union and began policies of radical political reform involving political liberalisation, called [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Gorbachev's policies were designed at dismantling authoritarian elements of the state that were developed by Stalin, aiming for a return to a supposed ideal Leninist state that retained one-party structure while allowing the democratic election of competing candidates within the party for political office. Gorbachev also aimed to seek d\u00e9tente with the West and end the Cold War that was no longer economically sustainable to be pursued by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and the United States under President [[George H. W. Bush]] joined in pushing for the dismantlement of apartheid and oversaw the dismantlement of South African colonial rule over [[Namibia]].\n\n[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989]]\nMeanwhile, the eastern European Marxist\u2013Leninist states politically deteriorated in response to the success of the Polish Solidarity movement and the possibility of Gorbachev-style political liberalisation. In 1989, revolts began across Eastern Europe and China against Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes. In China, the government refused to negotiate with student protestors, resulting in the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square attacks]] that stopped the revolts by force. The revolts culminated with the revolt in [[East Germany]] against the Marxist\u2013Leninist regime of [[Erich Honecker]] and demands for the [[Berlin Wall]] to be torn down. The event in East Germany developed into a popular mass revolt with sections of the Berlin Wall being torn down and East and West Berliners uniting. Gorbachev's refusal to use Soviet forces based in East Germany to suppress the revolt was seen as a sign that the Cold War had ended. Honecker was pressured to resign from office and the new government committed itself to reunification with West Germany. The Marxist\u2013Leninist regime of [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was forcefully overthrown in 1989 and Ceau\u0219escu was executed. The other Warsaw Pact regimes also fell during the [[Revolutions of 1989]], with the exception of the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]] that continued until 1992.\n\nUnrest and eventual collapse of Marxism\u2013Leninism also occurred in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], although for different reasons than those of the Warsaw Pact. The death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in 1980 and the subsequent vacuum of strong leadership allowed the rise of rival ethnic nationalism in the multinational country. The first leader to exploit such nationalism for political purposes was [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], who used it to seize power as [[president of Serbia]] and demanded concessions to Serbia and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbs]] by the other republics in the Yugoslav federation. This resulted in a surge of [[Slovene nationalism|Slovene]] and [[Croatian nationalism|Croat]] nationalism in response and the collapse of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1990, the victory of nationalists in multi-party elections in most of Yugoslavia's constituent republics and eventually [[Yugoslav Wars|civil war between the various nationalities]] beginning in 1991. Yugoslavia was dissolved in 1992.\n\nThe Soviet Union itself collapsed between 1990 and 1991, with a rise of secessionist nationalism and a political power dispute between Gorbachev and  [[Boris Yeltsin]], the new leader of the [[Russian Federation]]. With the Soviet Union collapsing, Gorbachev prepared the country to become a loose federation of independent states called the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Hardline Marxist\u2013Leninist leaders in the military reacted to Gorbachev's policies with the [[August Coup]] of 1991 in which hardline Marxist\u2013Leninist military leaders overthrew Gorbachev and seized control of the government. This regime only lasted briefly as widespread popular opposition erupted in street protests and refused to submit. Gorbachev was restored to power, but the various Soviet republics were now set for independence. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev officially announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union, ending the existence of the world's first Marxist\u2013Leninist-led state.\n\n=== Contemporary Marxism\u2013Leninism (1992\u2013present) ===\nSince the fall of the Eastern European Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes, the Soviet Union and a variety of African Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes, only a few Marxist\u2013Leninist parties remained in power. This include [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. Most Marxist\u2013Leninist communist parties outside of these nations have fared relatively poorly in elections. However, other parties have remained or became a [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation|relative strong]] force. This include [[Russia]], where the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] has remained a significant political force, winning the [[1995 Russian legislative election|1995 legislative election]], almost winning the [[1996 Russian presidential election|1996 presidential election]] and generally remaining the second most popular party. In [[Ukraine]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] has also exerted influence and governed the country after the [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1994 parliamentary election]] and again after the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2006 parliamentary election]]. However, the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2014 parliamentary election]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] resulted in the loss of its 32 members and no parliamentary representation.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html \"People's Front 0.33% ahead of Poroshenko Bloc with all ballots counted in Ukraine elections - CEC\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112000000/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233404.html|date=12 November 2014}}.

In [[Cyprus]], [[Dimitris Christofias]] of [[AKEL]] won the [[2008 Cypriot presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. AKEL has consistently been the first and third most popular party, winning the [[1970 Cypriot legislative election|1970]], [[1981 Cypriot legislative election|1981]], [[2001 Cypriot legislative election|2001]] and [[2006 Cypriot legislative election|2006]] legislative elections. In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Portugal]], the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] have been the second and fourth most popular parties until the [[2017 Czech legislative election|2017]] and [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|2009]] legislative elections, respectively. Since 2017, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia supports the [[ANO 2011]]\u2013[[Czech Social Democratic Party|\u010cSSD]] [[Andrej Babi\u0161' Second Cabinet|minority government]] while the Portuguese Communist Party has provided [[confidence and supply]] along with the [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"]] and [[Left Bloc]] to the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist]] [[XXI Constitutional Government of Portugal|minority government]] from 2015 to 2019. In [[Greece]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]] has led an interim and later national unity government between 1989 and 1990, constantly remaining the third or fourth most popular party. In [[Moldova]], the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] won the [[2001 Moldovan parliamentary election|2001]], [[2005 Moldovan parliamentary election|2005]] and [[April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election|April 2009]] parliamentary elections. However, the April 2009 Moldovan elections results were [[April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests|protested]] and [[July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election|another round was held in July]], resulting in the formation of the [[Alliance for European Integration]]. Failing to elect the president, [[2010 Moldovan parliamentary election|new parliamentary elections were held in November 2010]] which resulted in roughly the same representation in the parliament. According to Ion Marandici, a Moldovan political scientist, the Party of Communists differs from those in other countries because it managed to appeal to the ethnic minorities and the anti-Romanian Moldovans. After tracing the adaptation strategy of the party, he found confirming evidence for five of the factors contributing to its electoral success, already mentioned in the theoretical literature on former Marxist\u2013Leninist parties, namely the economic situation, the weakness of the opponents, the electoral laws, the fragmentation of the political spectrum and the legacy of the old regime. However, Marandici identified seven additional explanatory factors at work in the Moldovan case, namely the foreign support for certain political parties, separatism, the appeal to the ethnic minorities, the alliance-building capacity, the reliance on the Soviet notion of the Moldovan identity, the state-building process and the control over a significant portion of the media. It is due to these seven additional factors that the party managed to consolidate and expand its constituency. In the [[post-Soviet states]], the Party of Communists are the only ones who have been in power for so long and did not change the name of the party.<ref>Marandici, Ion (23 April 2010).

The People's Republic of China has continued the agenda of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s 1980s reforms by initiating significant privatisation of the national economy. At the same time, no corresponding political liberalisation has occurred as happened in previous years to Eastern European countries. The [[Naxalite\u2013Maoist insurgency]] has continued between the governments of [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]] against various Marxist\u2013Leninist movements, having been unabated since the 1960s. In India, the [[Manmohan Singh]] government depended on the parliamentary support of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] which has led state governments in [[Kerala]], [[Tripura]] and [[West Bengal]]. The armed wing of the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] has been fighting a war against the government of India since 1967 and is still active in half the country. Maoist rebels in [[Nepal]] engaged in a [[Nepalese Civil War|civil war]] from 1996 to 2006 that managed to topple the monarchy there and create a republic. [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist)]] leader [[Man Mohan Adhikari]] briefly became [[List of prime ministers of Nepal|prime minister]] and national leader from 1994 to 1995 and the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist]] guerrilla leader [[Prachanda]] was elected prime minister by the [[Constituent Assembly of Nepal]] in 2008. Prachanda has since been deposed as prime minister, leading the Maoists, who consider Prachanda's removal to be unjust, to abandon their legalistic approach and return to their street actions and militancy and to lead sporadic [[general strike]]s using their substantial influence on the Nepalese labour movement. These actions have oscillated between mild and intense. In the [[Philippines]], the Maoist-oriented [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and its armed wing, the [[New People's Army]], have been waging [[Communist rebellion in the Philippines|armed revolution]] against the existing Philippine government since 1968 and is still experiencing a low-scale guerrilla insurgency.\n\nIn Africa, several Marxist\u2013Leninist states reformed themselves and maintained power. In [[South Africa]], the [[South African Communist Party]] is a member of the [[Tripartite alliance]] alongside the [[African National Congress]] and the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]]. The [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] is a pan-African, Marxist\u2013Leninist party founded in 2013 by expelled former president of the [[African National Congress Youth League]] [[Julius Malema]] and his allies. [[Sri Lanka]] has had Marxist\u2013Leninist ministers in their national governments. In [[Zimbabwe]], former President [[Robert Mugabe]] of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front]], the country's long standing leader, was a professed Marxist\u2013Leninist.<ref>Talbot, Stephen (27 June 2006).

In [[Peru]], there has been an [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] between the Peruvian government and Marxist\u2013Leninist\u2013Maoist militants such as the [[Shining Path]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:\u201cStrengthen working discipline in collective farms\u201d \u2013 Uzbek, Tashkent, 1933 (Mardjani).jpg|thumb|left|1933 [[Soviet propaganda]] encouraging peasants and farmers to strengthen working discipline in [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collective farms]] in the [[Azeri Soviet Socialist Republic]]]]\nThe goal of Marxist\u2013Leninist [[political economy]] is the emancipation of men and women from the [[dehumanisation]] caused by mechanistic work that is [[Theory of alienation|psychologically alienating]] (without work\u2013life balance) which is performed in exchange for [[wage]]s that give limited financial-access to the material necessities of life (i.e. food and shelter). That personal and societal emancipation from [[poverty]] (material necessity) would maximise individual liberty by enabling men and women to pursue their interests and innate talents (artistic, industrial and intellectual) whilst working by choice, without the economic coercion of poverty. In the [[communist society]] of upper-stage economic development, the elimination of alienating labour (mechanistic work) depends upon the developments of [[high technology]] that improve the means of production and the means of distribution. To meet the material needs of a socialist society, the state uses a [[planned economy]] to co-ordinate the [[means of production]] and of distribution to supply and deliver the goods and services required throughout society and the national economy. The state serves as a safeguard for the ownership and as the coordinator of production through a universal economic plan.<ref name=\"Pons p. 138\">Pons, p. 138.</ref>\n\nFor the purpose of reducing waste and increasing efficiency, scientific planning replaces [[market mechanism]]s and [[price mechanism]]s as the guiding principle of the economy.<ref name=\"Pons p. 138\"/> The state's huge purchasing power replaces the role of market forces, with [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] not being achieved through market forces but by economic planning based on scientific [[Program evaluation|assessment]].<ref name=\"Pons p. 139\">Pons, p. 139.</ref> The [[wages]] of the worker are determined according to the type of skills and the type of work he or she can perform within the national economy.<ref name=\"Pons p. 140\">Pons, p. 140.</ref> Moreover, the economic value of the goods and services produced is based upon their [[use value]] (as material objects) and not upon the [[Labor theory of value|cost of production]] (value) or the [[Marginal Utility|exchange value]] (marginal utility). The [[profit motive]] as a driving force for production is replaced by social obligation to fulfil the economic plan.<ref name=\"Pons p. 139\"/> [[Wage]]s are set and differentiated according to skill and intensity of work. While socially utilised means of production are under public control, personal belongings or property of a personal nature that does not involve mass production of goods remains unaffected by the state.<ref name=\"Pons p. 140\"/>\n\nBecause Marxism\u2013Leninism has historically been the state ideology of countries who were economically undeveloped prior to [[socialist revolution]], or whose economies were nearly obliterated by war such as the [[German Democratic Republic]], the primary goal before achieving communism was the development of socialism in itself. Such was the case in the Soviet Union, where the economy was largely agrarian and urban industry was in a primitive stage. To develop socialism, the Soviet Union underwent [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union#Industrialization in practice|rapid industrialisation]] with pragmatic programs of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] that transplanted peasant populations to the cities, where they were educated and trained as [[industrial workers]] and then became the workforce of the new factories and industries. Likewise, the farmer populations worked the [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|system of collective farms]] to grow food to feed the industrial workers in the industrialised cities. Since the mid-1930s, Marxism\u2013Leninism has advocated an austere social-equality based upon [[asceticism]], [[egalitarianism]] and [[self-sacrifice]].<ref name=\"Pons p. 731\">Pons, p. 731.</ref> In the 1920s, the [[Bolshevik party]] semi-officially allowed some limited, small-scale wage inequality to boost labour productivity in the [[economy of the Soviet Union]]. These reforms were promoted to encourage materialism and acquisitiveness in order to stimulate economic growth.<ref name=\"Pons p. 731\"/> This pro-consumerist policy has been advanced on the lines of industrial pragmatism as it advances economic progress through bolstering industrialisation.<ref name=\"Pons p. 732\">Pons, p. 732.</ref>\n\nIn the economic praxis of Bolshevik Russia, there was a defining difference of political economy between socialism and communism. Lenin explained their conceptual similarity to Marx's descriptions of the lower-stage and the upper-stage of economic development, namely that immediately after a proletarian revolution in the socialist lower-stage society the practical economy must be based upon the individual labour contributed by men and women<ref>Cook, Chris, ed. (1989). ''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' (2nd ed.). pp. 221\u2013222.</ref> and that paid labour would be the basis of the communist upper-stage society that has realised the social precept of the slogan: \"[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]\".<ref>Krieger, Joel; Murphy, Craig N., eds.

Extrapolating from five philosophical bases of Marxism, namely that human history is the history of [[class struggle]] between a ruling class and an exploited class; that capitalism creates antagonistic [[social class]]es, i.e. the [[bourgeois]] exploiters and the exploited [[proletariat]]; that capitalism employs [[nationalist]] [[war]] to further private economic expansion; that [[socialism]] is an economic system that voids social classes through [[public ownership]] of the means of production and so will eliminate the economic causes of war; and that once the state ([[Socialist state|socialist]] or [[Communist state|communist]]) withers away, so shall international relations wither away because they are projections of national economic forces, Lenin said that the capitalists' exhaustion of domestic sources of investment profit by way of price-fixing [[Trust (business)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s, then prompts the same capitalists to export [[investment capital]] to undeveloped countries to finance the [[exploitation of natural resources]] and the native populations and to create new markets. That the capitalists' control of national politics ensures the government's military safeguarding of colonial investments and the consequent imperial competition for economic supremacy provokes international wars to protect their national interests.<ref name=\"auto\">Evans, Graham; Newnham, Jeffrey, eds. (1998). ''Penguin Dictionary of International Relations''. pp. 316\u2013317.</ref>\n\nIn the vertical perspective (social-class relations) of Marxism\u2013Leninism, the internal and international affairs of a country are a political continuum, not separate realms of human activity. This is the philosophic opposite of the horizontal perspectives (country-to-country) of the [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal]] and the [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] approaches to international relations. Colonial imperialism is the inevitable consequence\u00a0in the course of economic relations among countries when the domestic price-fixing of [[Monopoly|monopoly capitalism]] has voided profitable competition in the capitalist homeland. The ideology of [[New Imperialism]], rationalised as a [[civilising mission]], allowed the exportation of high-profit investment capital to undeveloped countries with uneducated, native populations (sources of cheap labour), plentiful raw materials for exploitation (factors for manufacture) and a colonial market to consume the [[surplus production]], which the capitalist homeland cannot consume. The example is the European [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914) in which imperialism was safeguarded by the national military.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTo secure the economic and settler colonies, foreign sources of new capital-investment-profit, the imperialist state seeks either political or military control of the limited resources (natural and human). The First World War (1914\u20131918) resulted from such geopolitical conflicts among the empires of Europe over colonial [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].<ref>Cook, Chris, ed. (1998).

As part of the planned economy, the Marxist\u2013Leninist state is meant to develop the [[proletariat]]'s universal education (academic and technical) and their [[class consciousness]] (political education) to facilitate their contextual understanding of the historical development of communism as presented in Marx's [[Historical materialism|theory of history]].<ref>Pons, p. 580.</ref>\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism supports the [[Women's liberation|emancipation of women]] and ending the exploitation of women. Marxist\u2013Leninist policy on family law has typically involved the elimination of the political power of the [[bourgeoisie]], the abolition of [[private property]] and an education that teaches citizens to abide by a disciplined and self-fulfilling lifestyle dictated by the social norms of communism as a means to establish a new social order.<ref name=\"Pons p. 319\">Pons, p. 319.</ref> The judicial reformation of [[family law]] eliminates [[patriarchy]] from the legal system.

The reformation of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] made [[marriage]] secular into a \"free and voluntary union\" between persons who are social-and-legal equals; facilitated [[divorce]]; legalised [[abortion]], eliminated [[bastardy]] (\"illegitimate children\"); and voided the political power of the bourgeoisie and the private property-status of the [[means of production]]. The educational system imparts the social norms for a self-disciplined and self-fulfilling way of life, by which the socialist citizens establish the social order necessary for realising a communist society.<ref>Pons, pp. 854\u2013856.</ref> With the advent of a classless society and the abolition of private property, society collectively assume many of the roles traditionally assigned to mothers and wives, with women becoming integrated into industrial work.

No genuine ideological imperative remained.

He was a close friend and ally of [[Ichiro Hatoyama]], and was the key figure in carrying out the \"conservative merger\" that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]].\n\nDespite being a powerful [[conservative]] politician in the [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d]] and [[Sh\u014dwa period|Sh\u014dwa]] eras, Miki remarkably never held any cabinet post. He still has a high reputation as the archetype of a behind-the-scenes power broker, and at the zenith of their power there were times when both [[Kanemaru Shin]] and [[Hiromu Nonaka]] were openly complimented by Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] for having \"surpassed Bukichi Miki\".\n\nMiki's nicknames included \"the heckling general\", \"the wily schemer\", and \"the great [[raccoon dog|tanuki]] of Japanese politics\".\n\n== Life before politics ==\nHe was born in [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], then in [[Ehime Prefecture]] but now in [[Kagawa Prefecture]], as the first son of Komon Miki, an antiques dealer. His family was not related to that of [[Takeo Miki]].\n\nIn his second year at Takamatsu Secondary, now Kagawa Prefectural Takamatsu High School, he walked out on his bill at an [[udon]] restaurant and encouraged others to do the same, and thus was expelled from school. He transferred to Doshisha Secondary in Kyoto, now Doshisha Junior and Senior High School, but was expelled again for getting into a fight. He went to Tokyo with the help of the politician Tooru Hoshi but on 21 June 1901, the day on which Miki would go to work as a live-in student at his law office, Hoshi was assassinated.\n\nMiki was admitted into Tokyo Vocational School, called [[Waseda University]] from 1902 and on, where he counted among his classmates future politicians [[Ry\u016btar\u014d Nagai|Ryutaro Nagai]] and [[Ikuo Oyama]] and baseball player Shin Hashido. While spending much of his time chasing women in [[Shinjuku]], he earnestly studied law and practiced baseball. Although he even joined the Waseda Baseball Club at its inception, it was said that he exhibited little talent.<ref>Shogaku Yudate, \u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u4eba\u56fd\u8a18 (Tokyo: Popura Shobo, 1934), 117-118.</ref> However, his name does not appear in Bushi, the official records of the club, and he was also not a member of the Tomon Club, composed of the Waseda Baseball Club's alumni. This was also the time of his budding romance with Kaneko Amano, a woman known as \"the beauty of Waseda\" who was popular among the students and would go on to become Miki's wife. He graduated in 1904.\n\nMiki worked for a brief time as a scribe at Waseda University Library.<ref>Hideyuki Fujiwara, \"[http://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/Libraries/fumi/78/fumi78.pdf \u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3056\u308b\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u54e1 \u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409],\" Waseda Daigaku Toshokan Ho, March 15, 2010, 30-31.</ref> The next year in 1905 he went to work with the [[Bank of Japan]] attached to their [[Moji-ku, Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b|Moji]] branch. However he participated in an open-house anti-government meeting in opposition to the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] and after giving a speech demanding the resignation of Prime Minister [[Taro Katsura]] he was charged with violating the code of conduct for civil servants and was discharged. In 1907 he passed the Higher Civil Service Examination for the judiciary and was appointed as an assistant judicial officer in the [[Tokyo District Court]], but life as a civil servant did not suit his personality and after seven months he instead became a lawyer. The same year he married Kaneko Amano.\n\n== In pre-war politics ==\nIn 1913 Miki was elected to the [[Ushigome]] ward assembly. Soon after he ran for a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] but was defeated. In 1916 he joined the [[Kenseikai]] and in 1917 won a seat in that year's general elections to the House.\n\nMiki distinguished himself in his new role as a member of the House. Above all he more than earned his nickname, \"the heckling general\", through his trenchant criticisms of the government. He also caught the eye of [[Osachi Hamaguchi]] following his spirited debate with [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Minister]] [[Takejir\u014d Tokonami|Takejiro Tokonami]] in defense of [[universal suffrage]]. After that Hamaguchi became his political mentor.\n\nIn 1920 Miki toured Siberia for one month as a member of a committee of inquiry of the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]] concerning the [[Japan during the Siberian Intervention|Siberian expedition]]. The tour led Miki to the conclusion that the expedition was interference in the internal affairs of another nation inspired by the militaristic ambitions of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] who were steeped in the traditions of the [[Meiji oligarchy]]. Therefore, he wrote up an open letter and a speech for [[Interpellation (politics)|question period]] which held the militarists, oligarchs, and bureaucrats accountable for the war and sought to link the neutralization of these forces to the establishment of true parliamentary democracy. With a view of also using it to force the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister [[Takashi Hara]], Miki handed in the completed manuscript to [[Takaaki Kato]], president of the Kenseikai, through Hamaguchi. However Miki was disheartened when the manuscript was rejected by Kato and Hamaguchi who advised him to focus on internal matters for fear his revelations about the origins of the war would damage Japan's international reputation. Even so, they were both deeply impressed by the depth and detail of his work.<ref>[[Isamu Togawa]], \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 71-75.</ref>\n\nIn June 1922 Miki was also elected to the Tokyo City Council. He formed the Shisei Kakushin Domei which emphasized cleaning up city politics and clashed with the [[Rikken Seiyukai]]-aligned Shinkokai. At that time one of his political foes in Tokyo City politics was Shinkokai member Ichiro Hatoyama, who would later become a close friend.\n\nIn January 1924, at the young age of 39 after having served only two terms in the House, Miki was promoted to the post of Kenseikai Secretary General and led the party in the [[1924 Japanese general election|general election of May 1924]]. The Kenseikai won a plurality of the seats, and Takaaki Kato set up his first cabinet with the support of the so-called \"three groups protecting the constitution\", the Kenseikai, the Rikken Seiyukai, and the Kakushin Club.\n\nWhen Hamaguchi Osachi, who Miki had looked up to for a long time, took office as [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]], Miki was appointed the Ministry's parliamentary councillor under Hamaguchi's tutelage. In 1927 he joined the [[Rikken Minseito]] under Hamaguchi's leadership, and at the same time went on a tour of Europe. Thus, Miki had reached the pinnacle of his pre-war political career when a disaster befell him. In 1928 he was implicated in a case of bribery by Keisei Railway of the Tokyo municipal government, was convicted in court, and, for the time being, ended up leaving politics.\n\n== Political comeback up to the purge ==\nIn 1939 he became president of the newspaper firm Hochi Shimbun. He returned to politics in 1942, winning election as an independent candidate in that year's [[1942 Japanese general election|general election]]. In the election, Ichiro Hatoyama also won office as an unaligned candidate. Before the war Miki and Hatoyama had been leading members of rivals parties, the Rikken Minseito and the Rikken Seiyukai. However, in wartime they were both defenders of liberalism who together resisted the military authorities, even if in the end they were both compelled to affiliate with the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]]. At that time, Hatoyama and Miki made a pact to form a government one day with Hatoyama as prime minister and Miki as Speaker of the House of Representatives. In August 1942 Hochi Shimbun was bought out by [[Yomiuri Shimbun]].\n\nAfter the war, he took part in planning the establishment of the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]]. In the [[1946 Japanese general election|elections of April 1946]] the Liberal Party won a plurality and it seemed like a real possibility that Hatoyama would become prime minister, but the formation of the cabinet fell through at the last minute when Hatoyama was [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purged]] by the US occupation authorities. [[Shigeru Yoshida]] become President of the Liberal Party in Hatoyama's stead.\n\nBecause Yoshida still disliked the pre-war politicians for having been deferent to the military, he selected his cabinet in private consultation with his close advisor Joji Hayashi without discussing the matter with senior members of the Liberal Party including Miki, who was Chairman of the Executive Council, and Secretary General Ichiro Kono. The party leadership was furious, some even demanding Yoshida's removal from the party presidency, but Miki managed to calm them down by pointing out that if they withdrew their support from Yoshida then power would likely pass to the [[Japan Socialist Party|Socialist Party]].<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 209-219.</ref>\n\nThen, on 24 May 1946, two days after the formation of Yoshida's first cabinet, Miki was also purged.\n\n== The fall of Yoshida and ascension of Hatoyama ==\nOn 24 June 1951, when the ban on holding office was lifted for those purged, Miki began seeking to have Prime Minister Yoshida removed in cooperation with Ichiro Kono and Hatoyama. The three were reinstated in the Liberal Party, but by now the party was completely controlled by the \"Yoshida school\" directly allied with the Prime Minister, and a promise Yoshida had made to hand back power to Hatoyama after his return had been effectively annulled.\n\nMiki, Hatoyama, and Kono thus moved towards founding a new political party. However, Hatoyama suffered a stroke and the plan fell through. Miki changed course in favor of undermining Yoshida from within the Liberal Party. Operating behind the scenes, Miki devoted himself to all manner of schemes and became leader of the anti-Yoshida movement. To combat this, Yoshida took the advice of his political adviser Tsuruhei Matsuno and jolted the pro-Hatoyama faction by calling [[1952 Japanese general election|a snap election]] in August 1952. On the recommendation of Kozen Hirokawa, Yoshida also expelled both Ichiro Kono and [[Tanzan Ishibashi]] from the Liberal Party on the basis of their opposition to his leadership. The fact that Miki Bukichi, the central dissident, was not expelled was said to be due to the debt of gratitude Yoshida felt to him for saving his first cabinet in 1946.\n\nThe Liberal Party won a majority government in the elections and Yoshida formed his fourth cabinet. The remainder of the pro-Hatoyama faction constituted the \"Democratization League\", essentially an opposition party operating within the ruling party. The Democratization League absented itself from the [[National Diet|Diet]] when a motion of censure was tabled by the opposition parties against [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] [[Hayato Ikeda]] for his gaffe, \"The bankruptcy and suicide of one or two small businessmen can't be avoided.\" The motion passed and Ikeda resigned.\n\nIn December 1952 the Democratization League ratcheted up the pressure on Yoshida against the backdrop of the passage of the revised draft budget. Next year, at the same time as the League arranged for Kono and Ishibashi to re-join the party, it forced the resignation of Secretary General Joji Hayashi and Chairman of the Executive Council Shuji Masutani, who were key allies of Prime Minister Yoshida. Miki was appointed Masutani's successor in the party's Executive Council. Seeking to throw the Liberal Party establishment into disarray, Miki drove a wedge between Yoshida and his ally Kozen Hirokawa by putting the idea into his head that Yoshida intended to make [[Taketora Ogata]] his successor. Then Miki slyly proposed to the Yoshida camp that Hirokawa be elevated to the position of Secretary General, presenting Yoshida with a no-win scenario in which he could either accede to the request and allow Miki to manipulate the party through Hirokawa, or refuse the request and further alienate him.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u5409\u7530\u5b66\u6821 (Tokyo: Ryudo Shuppan, 1971), 255-257.</ref> In the end, Hirokawa was not made Secretary General and his behind-the-scenes split with Yoshida became definitive.\n\nOn 28 February 1953 Yoshida responded to a question from the rightist socialist representative Eiichi Nishimura by calling him a \"stupid fool\" in the Diet. Miki discussed the matter behind closed doors with the leader of the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]], [[Inejiro Asanuma]]. Asanuma was considering a motion of no-confidence against the government but Miki changed his mind and Asanuma agreed instead to table a disciplinary action against the Prime Minister himself. Miki also brought [[Takeo Miki]] together with Tadao Oasa and Kenzo Matsumura, who were veteran politicians from before the war, and reached an understanding with them, and even arranged for Hirokawa's 30-man faction to abstain from the vote. Thus, the disciplinary action was approved.\n\nMiki then talked reluctant opposition parties into tabling a motion of no-confidence against the government and entered talks with Yoshida while using the motion as a bargaining chip to urge the beleaguered Prime Minister to resign. Yoshida nevertheless turned Miki down and the Democratization League's 22 members separated from the Liberal Party. With their backing, on 14 March 1953, the House of Representatives passed the motion of no-confidence 229 votes in favor versus 218 against. Hirokawa and 16 of his followers then also split with the Liberal Party to form the Separatist Liberal Party.\n\nYoshida immediately dissolved the House and in [[1953 Japanese general election|the elections]] his Liberals won 199 seats, a loss of 23, but held onto their status as first party. The separatists attained only 35 seats. In November, half a year from the election, Yoshida and Hatoyama met one another and most of the separatists who were loyal to Hatoyama re-joined the Liberal Party. Only eight men refused to return, Bukichi Miki, Ichiro Kono, Takechiyo Matsuda, To Matsunaga, Umekichi Nakamura, Shinjiro Yamamura, Masanosuke Ikeda, and Kaku Ando, who together called themselves the Japan Liberal Party. Others called them \"The Eight Samurai,\" in reference to the new movie [[The Seven Samurai]].\n\nIn January 1954 con-man Masutomi Ito was exposed for perpetrating mass investment fraud, a scheme which eventually led investigators to a ring of shipbuilders who were bribing politicians in exchange for subsidies. Liberal Party Secretary General [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] and Political Affairs Research Committee head Hayato Ikeda were suspected of involvement. A few days earlier Yoshida's Liberals had met with the Reform Party and the Separatist Liberal Party and held negotiations with representatives of each party in the hopes of unifying the three [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning parties. When the talks fell through, Miki saw his chance and linked up with Hatoyama and [[Nobusuke Kishi]] of the Liberal Party as well as Reform Party members Takeo Miki and Tadao Oasa to seek the establishment of a new anti-Yoshida political party. In November 1954 the [[Japan Democratic Party (1954)|Democratic Party]] was constituted with Hatoyama as president, Kishi as Secretary General, and Miki as Chairman of the Executive Council.\n\nNext month Yoshida's cabinet finally resigned en masse and Hatoyama became prime minister. Half of Miki's long-held ambition for a government with Hatoyama as prime minister and himself as Speaker of the House of Representatives had been achieved. However, when the House elected its speaker immediately following the [[1955 Japanese general election|general elections]], all the parties except Miki's Democratic Party banded together and put forward Liberal Party member Shuji Masutani as their joint candidate. Because of this, Miki, the candidate of the governing party who was expected to get elected as a matter of course, ended up being defeated and his dream came to nothing.\n\n== The \"conservative merger\" ==\n[[File:Bukichi Miki.jpg|thumb|right|Bukichi Miki from his days as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]]]]On 13 April 1955 Miki called upon the right-wing political parties to rally together and announced that should rivalries with the Hatoyama cabinet become an obstacle to the merger, the government was prepared to resign en masse.<ref>Mayumi Itoh, The Hatoyama Dynasty: Japanese Political Leadership Through the Generations (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), 127.</ref> At this point Miki had been fretting over the unification of the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]] with its rivals the Rightist Socialists and what's more had been told by his doctor that he had contracted cancer and would live no more than three years.\n\nAt the same time as Miki was striving to reach consensus in the Democratic Party he engaged in manoeuvres within the Liberal Party. On 15 May 1955 he met with Banboku Ono, the Chairman of the Executive Council in the Liberal Party. Ono had once been a close aide to Hatoyama but was superseded by Miki even though Miki had previously been Hatoyama's political enemy, and for that Ono despised Miki more than anyone else. Even so, Miki pleaded with Ono, cleverly appealing to his strong sense of patriotism, and won his support. Then a meeting was held between Miki and Kishi and their Liberal Party counterparts Banboku Ono and Kojiro Ishii and they officially began the process of merging their parties. On the other hand, Reform Party leaders Takeo Miki and Kenzo Matsumura fired back with their argument that conservatives should be represented by two parties rather than only one. As the debate was coming to nothing, Hatoyama blurted out while weeping that his cabinet would have to resign, and panicking at the prospect, they ended up backing the merger.\n\nHowever, the final controversy over who should be selected for the presidency of the new party was no easier. As a result, they put the presidency on the back burner and set up an interim presidential committee, agreeing to choose the president through an election after the party had been formed. Thus, the difficulty-fraught conservative merger was completed, and Japan's first unified right-wing party, the Liberal Democratic Party, was born. Miki, Hatoyama, Ono, and Taketora Ogata shared the interim presidential committee, and five months later Hatoyama was inaugurated as president of the Liberal Democratic Party. On the future of the Liberal Democratic Party, which had gotten off the ground leaving the most vexatious conflicts unresolved, Miki is well known for his assessment that the party \"would be lucky to last two or three years\".<ref>Kent E. Calder, Crisis and Compensation: Public Policy and Political Stability in Japan, 1949-1986 (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1988), 59.</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nMiki was bedridden from April 1956, and his condition gradually worsened. On 4 July he died at his home in [[Meguro, Tokyo]]. The cause of death was stomach cancer. He was 71 years old.\n\nA bronze statue of Miki was constructed near [[Ritsurin Garden]] in his hometown of Takamatsu.\n\n== Famous statements and retorts ==\nDuring the 1917 general elections, in which Miki would be elected for the first time, the Rikken Seiyukai candidate Zenshiro Tsuboya said of Miki in a speech, \"I'm not going to name names, but there is a certain candidate who has two years worth of unpaid rent. He even owes more than one year's worth of debt to the rice merchant. Can such a man really discuss state affairs at the podium of parliament as a representative of our nation? I believe that such a candidate in these circumstances should gracefully decline to run for office.\" At the next town hall meeting Miki hit back, saying \"I've heard that a certain candidate has been going around attacking as disgraceful the fact that a man with debts is running for office. That debt-ridden candidate is I, the humble Bukichi Miki. Because I am poor, I am in debt. Though he was just called a rice merchant, that man is the rice merchant Mr. Yamashita from Yamabuki. It was said that I owe him more than one year's worth of debt, but that's not correct. Actually, I owe him more than two years' worth of debt. I also owe rent, but not two years' worth. To be more precise, the situation is that my landlord has been waiting for payment for more than three years. I want to correct this misinformation about me right now!\" The room burst into laughter and applause and one person shouted \"Nice one, debt king!\" Miki's landlord and the rice merchant Tatsujiro Yamashita were also present at the meeting and after that they both stood up at Miki's urging. Yamashita said, \"I am the rice merchant Yamashita. How about it everyone, will you please support Mr. Miki?\" That was the last time the stunned Zenshiro Tsuboya would bring up Miki's debts.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 7-9.</ref>\n\nDuring the 43rd session of the Imperial Diet which began on 29 June 1920, [[Korekiyo Takahashi]], the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]] in [[Takashi Hara]]'s cabinet who went by the nickname \"Daruma\", was in the process of explaining the naval budget. When Takahashi said \"We will make this into a long-term plan of ten years for the army and eight years for the navy\", Miki shouted out \"Nine years for Daruma!\" This was a very witty statement using the story of the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma|Daruma Daishi]] who faced a wall in China's Shaolin Monastery and after doing zen meditation for nine years, achieved enlightenment. The assemblymen burst into laughter and Takahashi also stopped speaking, looked back at Prime Minister Hara in the ministers' gallery, and smiled wryly. Even Takaaki Kato and Osachi Hamaguchi, up to then well known for their stoic seriousness, famously cracked up in their seats.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 63-64.</ref> Also during the time when Hara was serving as prime minister, a cabinet minister was explaining the aims of a proposed piece of legislation in a somber and monotone voice as if reading a sutra. When the session adjourned Miki jeered \"Next we may burn the incense\", and the assembly burst out laughing.\n\nAt a meeting of MPs from the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]] for deciding party policy towards the [[Hideki Tojo|Tojo]] cabinet's Corporate Restructuring Bill, [[Seigo Nakano]] pointed at the senior members of the IRAPA and remarked \"Swarming around the center of power, I see only sycophants. This will in the end lead to the destruction of our country. The people who are leading Japan astray are all the bootlickers in the IRAPA.\" When the mainstream IRAPA members booed Nakano, Miki abruptly stood up and famously shouted \"Shut up, all you bootlickers!\", and the hecklers immediately fell silent.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 170.</ref>\n\nAt a speaking event Miki attended during the general elections of 1952, a rival office-seeker, Toshichi Fuke, said of Miki \"After the war, we achieved [[Women's suffrage#Japan|equal rights for men and women]], but even so one big-shot candidate keeps four mistresses! Is such an immoral man qualified to be involved in national politics?\" Miki. however, was the next one up to the podium, and he replied \"The person that the impotent candidate who stands before me calls a 'big-shot candidate' is the humble Bukichi Miki. What Bukichi Miki is thinking is, would you all prefer to give your one precious vote to this pitifully weak candidate, or to a big-shot like me? What's more, because I must strive for accuracy, I will go ahead and correct the mathematical errors of the aforementioned weak candidate right now. It was said that I have four mistresses, but actually I have five. Confusing four with five ought to be considered shameful even for a first grader. It seems like he failed to count one. However, all these women have now become old maids and aren't of use to me anymore. Even so, Bukichi Miki could never do something so inhumane as abandon them! Even today I care for them all.\" The crowd roared with laughter and approval.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 257-259.</ref> Miki kept his five mistresses up to his death, who lived with him and cared for his wife Kaneko. However, he was also a loving husband who had stated, \"The one for whom I have never stopped feeling true affection is definitely my wife Kaneko. It's just that I happened to fall in love with other women.\"<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 44.</ref>\n\nWhile Miki was serving as Chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party, the [[Shiun Maru disaster]] occurred, a deadly collision between two [[Japanese National Railways]] ferries, resulting in the resignation of JNR President Sonosuke Nagasaki. Miki proposed [[Shinji Sogo]], who had a long career as a bureaucrat in the pre-war [[Japanese Government Railways]], to fill his shoes and met him personally to persuade him. At the meeting Miki aggressively approached the wavering Sogo and said \"Our railway department, which has always been like a home to you, is probably on the verge of collapse due to these scandals. Are you so disloyal that you won't even try to stand and fight for your homeland when called upon?\" This led Sogo to answer \"I will never be a traitor!\" and convinced him to take up the post.<ref>[http://www.ifsa.jp/index.php?Gsogoshinji article on Shinji Sogo - Kogaku Shimbun International Foreign Students Association]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Yo Mizuki, \u8aa0\u5fc3\u8aa0\u610f, \u5653\u3092\u3064\u304f: \u81ea\u6c11\u515a\u3092\u751f\u3093\u3060\u7537\u30fb\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409\u306e\u751f\u6daf (Tokyo: Nihon Keizai Shinbunsha, 2005).\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091201121520/http://www.pluto.dti.ne.jp/~mor97512/kaku1-9.HTML article on Bukichi Miki] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = President of the Liberal Democratic Party\n| before = New political party\n| years  = 1955-1956, Served alongside: Ichiro Hatoyama, Taketora Ogata, Bamboku Ono\n| after  = Ichiro Hatoyama\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = Chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party\n| before = New political party\n| years  = 1954-1955\n| after  = \"conservative merger\" with Liberal Party\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = Chairman of the Executive Council of the Liberal Party\n| before = New political party\n| years  = 1945-1946\n| after  = Shigeru Yoshida\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = Secretary General of the Kenseikai\n| before = Shoju Koyama\n| years  = 1924-1925\n| after  = Takeji Yatsunami\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miki, Bukichi}}\n[[Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Empire of Japan)]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Japan)]]\n[[Category:Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) politicians]]\n[[Category:Japanese lawyers]]\n[[Category:Japanese businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Kagawa Prefecture]]\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Takamatsu, Kagawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox officeholder\n|name             = Bukichi Miki\n|native_name = {{nobold|\u4e09\u6728 \u6b66\u5409}}\n|native_name_lang = ja\n|image            = Bukichi miki.jpg\n|imagesize        = 200px\n|caption          = Bukichi Miki in 1924\n|nationality      = Japanese\n|birth_date       = {{birth date|1884|8|15}}\n|birth_place      = Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture\n|death_date       = {{death date and age|1956|7|4|1884|8|15|}}\n|death_place      = Meguro, Tokyo\n|alma_mater       = Waseda University\n|occupation       = Lawyer\n|spouse           = Kaneko\n|party            = Kenseikai, Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, Greater Japan Political Association, Liberal Party, Democratic Party, Liberal-Democratic Party\n|office           = Member of the House of Representatives for various Tokyo districts\n|term_start       = 22 April 1917 \u2013 26 March 1934 (6 terms)\n|office2          = Member of the House of Representatives for various Kagawa Prefecture districts\n|term_start2      = 1 May 1942 \u2013 18 December 1945, 11 April 1946 \u2013 22 June 1946, 2 October 1952 \u2013 4 July 1956 (5 terms)\n}}\n{{Nihongo|'''Bukichi Miki'''|\u4e09\u6728 \u6b66\u5409|Miki Bukichi|15 August 1884 \u2013 4 July 1956}} was a Japanese politician. He was a close friend and ally of [[Ichiro Hatoyama]], and was the key figure in carrying out the \"conservative merger\" that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]].\n\nDespite being a powerful [[conservative]] politician in the [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d]] and [[Sh\u014dwa period|Sh\u014dwa]] eras, Miki remarkably never held any cabinet post. He still has a high reputation as the archetype of a behind-the-scenes power broker, and at the zenith of their power there were times when both [[Kanemaru Shin]] and [[Hiromu Nonaka]] were openly complimented by Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] for having \"surpassed Bukichi Miki\".\n\nMiki's nicknames included \"the heckling general\", \"the wily schemer\", and \"the great tanuki of Japanese politics\".\n\n== Life before politics ==\nHe was born in [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], then in [[Ehime Prefecture]] but now in [[Kagawa Prefecture]], as the first son of Komon Miki, an antiques dealer. His family was not related to that of [[Takeo Miki]].\n\nIn his second year at Takamatsu Secondary, now Kagawa Prefectural Takamatsu High School, he walked out on his bill at an [[udon]] restaurant and encouraged others to do the same, and thus was expelled from school. He transferred to Doshisha Secondary in Kyoto, now Doshisha Junior and Senior High School, but was expelled again for getting into a fight. He went to Tokyo with the help of the politician Tooru Hoshi but on 21 June 1901, the day on which Miki would go to work as a live-in student at his law office, Hoshi was assassinated.\n\nMiki was admitted into Tokyo Vocational School, called [[Waseda University]] from 1902 and on, where he counted among his classmates future politicians [[Ry\u016btar\u014d Nagai|Ryutaro Nagai]] and [[Ikuo Oyama]] and baseball player Shin Hashido. While spending much of his time chasing women in [[Shinjuku]], he earnestly studied law and practiced baseball. Although he even joined the Waseda Baseball Club at its inception, it was said that he exhibited little talent.<ref>Shogaku Yudate, \u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u4eba\u56fd\u8a18 (Tokyo: Popura Shobo, 1934), 117-118.</ref> However, his name does not appear in Bushi, the official records of the club, and he was also not a member of the Tomon Club, composed of the Waseda Baseball Club's alumni. This was also the time of his budding romance with Kaneko Amano, a woman known as \"the beauty of Waseda\" who was popular among the students and would go on to become Miki's wife. He graduated in 1904.\n\nMiki worked for a brief time as a scribe at Waseda University Library.<ref>Hideyuki Fujiwara, \"[http://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/Libraries/fumi/78/fumi78.pdf \u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3056\u308b\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u54e1 \u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409],\" Waseda Daigaku Toshokan Ho, March 15, 2010, 30-31.</ref> The next year in 1905 he went to work with the [[Bank of Japan]] attached to their [[Moji-ku, Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b|Moji]] branch. However he participated in an open-house anti-government meeting in opposition to the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] and after giving a speech demanding the resignation of Prime Minister [[Taro Katsura]] he was charged with violating the code of conduct for civil servants and was discharged. In 1907 he passed the Higher Civil Service Examination for the judiciary and was appointed as an assistant judicial officer in the [[Tokyo District Court]], but life as a civil servant did not suit his personality and after seven months he instead became a lawyer. The same year he married Kaneko Amano.\n\n== In pre-war politics ==\nIn 1913 Miki was elected to the [[Ushigome]] ward assembly. Soon after he ran for a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] but was defeated. In 1916 he joined the [[Kenseikai]] and in 1917 won a seat in that year's general elections to the House.\n\nMiki distinguished himself in his new role as a member of the House. Above all he more than earned his nickname, \"the heckling general\", through his trenchant criticisms of the government. He also caught the eye of [[Osachi Hamaguchi]] following his spirited debate with [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Minister]] [[Takejir\u014d Tokonami|Takejiro Tokonami]] in defense of [[universal suffrage]]. After that Hamaguchi became his political mentor.\n\nIn 1920 Miki toured Siberia for one month as a member of a committee of inquiry of the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]] concerning the [[Japan during the Siberian Intervention|Siberian expedition]]. The tour led Miki to the conclusion that the expedition was interference in the internal affairs of another nation inspired by the militaristic ambitions of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] who were steeped in the traditions of the [[Meiji oligarchy]]. Therefore, he wrote up an open letter and a speech for [[Interpellation (politics)|question period]] which held the militarists, oligarchs, and bureaucrats accountable for the war and sought to link the neutralization of these forces to the establishment of true parliamentary democracy. With a view of also using it to force the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister [[Takashi Hara]], Miki handed in the completed manuscript to [[Takaaki Kato]], president of the Kenseikai, through Hamaguchi. However Miki was disheartened when the manuscript was rejected by Kato and Hamaguchi who advised him to focus on internal matters for fear his revelations about the origins of the war would damage Japan's international reputation. Even so, they were both deeply impressed by the depth and detail of his work.<ref>[[Isamu Togawa]], \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 71-75.</ref>\n\nIn June 1922 Miki was also elected to the Tokyo City Council. He formed the Shisei Kakushin Domei which emphasized cleaning up city politics and clashed with the [[Rikken Seiyukai]]-aligned Shinkokai. At that time one of his political foes in Tokyo City politics was Shinkokai member Ichiro Hatoyama, who would later become a close friend.\n\nIn January 1924, at the young age of 39 after having served only two terms in the House, Miki was promoted to the post of Kenseikai Secretary General and led the party in the [[1924 Japanese general election|general election of May 1924]]. The Kenseikai won a plurality of the seats, and Takaaki Kato set up his first cabinet with the support of the so-called \"three groups protecting the constitution\", the Kenseikai, the Rikken Seiyukai, and the Kakushin Club.\n\nWhen Hamaguchi Osachi, who Miki had looked up to for a long time, took office as [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]], Miki was appointed the Ministry's parliamentary councillor under Hamaguchi's tutelage. In 1927 he joined the [[Rikken Minseito]] under Hamaguchi's leadership, and at the same time went on a tour of Europe. Thus, Miki had reached the pinnacle of his pre-war political career when a disaster befell him. In 1928 he was implicated in a case of bribery by Keisei Railway of the Tokyo municipal government, was convicted in court, and, for the time being, ended up leaving politics.\n\n== Political comeback up to the purge ==\nIn 1939 he became president of the newspaper firm Hochi Shimbun. He returned to politics in 1942, winning election as an independent candidate in that year's [[1942 Japanese general election|general election]]. In the election, Ichiro Hatoyama also won office as an unaligned candidate. Before the war Miki and Hatoyama had been leading members of rivals parties, the Rikken Minseito and the Rikken Seiyukai. However, in wartime they were both defenders of liberalism who together resisted the military authorities, even if in the end they were both compelled to affiliate with the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]]. At that time, Hatoyama and Miki made a pact to form a government one day with Hatoyama as prime minister and Miki as Speaker of the House of Representatives. In August 1942 Hochi Shimbun was bought out by [[Yomiuri Shimbun]].\n\nAfter the war, he took part in planning the establishment of the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]]. In the [[1946 Japanese general election|elections of April 1946]] the Liberal Party won a plurality and it seemed like a real possibility that Hatoyama would become prime minister, but the formation of the cabinet fell through at the last minute when Hatoyama was [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purged]] by the US occupation authorities. [[Shigeru Yoshida]] become President of the Liberal Party in Hatoyama's stead.\n\nBecause Yoshida still disliked the pre-war politicians for having been deferent to the military, he selected his cabinet in private consultation with his close advisor Joji Hayashi without discussing the matter with senior members of the Liberal Party including Miki, who was Chairman of the Executive Council, and Secretary General Ichiro Kono. The party leadership was furious, some even demanding Yoshida's removal from the party presidency, but Miki managed to calm them down by pointing out that if they withdrew their support from Yoshida then power would likely pass to the [[Japan Socialist Party|Socialist Party]].<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 209-219.</ref>\n\nThen, on 24 May 1946, two days after the formation of Yoshida's first cabinet, Miki was also purged.\n\n== The fall of Yoshida and ascension of Hatoyama ==\nOn 24 June 1951, when the ban on holding office was lifted for those purged, Miki began seeking to have Prime Minister Yoshida removed in cooperation with Ichiro Kono and Hatoyama. The three were reinstated in the Liberal Party, but by now the party was completely controlled by the \"Yoshida school\" directly allied with the Prime Minister, and a promise Yoshida had made to hand back power to Hatoyama after his return had been effectively annulled.\n\nMiki, Hatoyama, and Kono thus moved towards founding a new political party. However, Hatoyama suffered a stroke and the plan fell through. Miki changed course in favor of undermining Yoshida from within the Liberal Party. Operating behind the scenes, Miki devoted himself to all manner of schemes and became leader of the anti-Yoshida movement. To combat this, Yoshida took the advice of his political adviser Tsuruhei Matsuno and jolted the pro-Hatoyama faction by calling [[1952 Japanese general election|a snap election]] in August 1952. On the recommendation of Kozen Hirokawa, Yoshida also expelled both Ichiro Kono and [[Tanzan Ishibashi]] from the Liberal Party on the basis of their opposition to his leadership. The fact that Miki Bukichi, the central dissident, was not expelled was said to be due to the debt of gratitude Yoshida felt to him for saving his first cabinet in 1946.\n\nThe Liberal Party won a majority government in the elections and Yoshida formed his fourth cabinet. The remainder of the pro-Hatoyama faction constituted the \"Democratization League\", essentially an opposition party operating within the ruling party. The Democratization League absented itself from the [[National Diet|Diet]] when a motion of censure was tabled by the opposition parties against [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] [[Hayato Ikeda]] for his gaffe, \"The bankruptcy and suicide of one or two small businessmen can't be avoided.\" The motion passed and Ikeda resigned.\n\nIn December 1952 the Democratization League ratcheted up the pressure on Yoshida against the backdrop of the passage of the revised draft budget. Next year, at the same time as the League arranged for Kono and Ishibashi to re-join the party, it forced the resignation of Secretary General Joji Hayashi and Chairman of the Executive Council Shuji Masutani, who were key allies of Prime Minister Yoshida. Miki was appointed Masutani's successor in the party's Executive Council. Seeking to throw the Liberal Party establishment into disarray, Miki drove a wedge between Yoshida and his ally Kozen Hirokawa by putting the idea into his head that Yoshida intended to make [[Taketora Ogata]] his successor. Then Miki slyly proposed to the Yoshida camp that Hirokawa be elevated to the position of Secretary General, presenting Yoshida with a no-win scenario in which he could either accede to the request and allow Miki to manipulate the party through Hirokawa, or refuse the request and further alienate him.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u5409\u7530\u5b66\u6821 (Tokyo: Ryudo Shuppan, 1971), 255-257.</ref> In the end, Hirokawa was not made Secretary General and his behind-the-scenes split with Yoshida became definitive.\n\nOn 28 February 1953 Yoshida responded to a question from the rightist socialist representative Eiichi Nishimura by calling him a \"stupid fool\" in the Diet. Miki discussed the matter behind closed doors with the leader of the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]], [[Inejiro Asanuma]]. Asanuma was considering a motion of no-confidence against the government but Miki changed his mind and Asanuma agreed instead to table a disciplinary action against the Prime Minister himself. Miki also brought [[Takeo Miki]] together with Tadao Oasa and Kenzo Matsumura, who were veteran politicians from before the war, and reached an understanding with them, and even arranged for Hirokawa's 30-man faction to abstain from the vote. Thus, the disciplinary action was approved.\n\nMiki then talked reluctant opposition parties into tabling a motion of no-confidence against the government and entered talks with Yoshida while using the motion as a bargaining chip to urge the beleaguered Prime Minister to resign. Yoshida nevertheless turned Miki down and the Democratization League's 22 members separated from the Liberal Party. With their backing, on 14 March 1953, the House of Representatives passed the motion of no-confidence 229 votes in favor versus 218 against. Hirokawa and 16 of his followers then also split with the Liberal Party to form the Separatist Liberal Party.\n\nYoshida immediately dissolved the House and in [[1953 Japanese general election|the elections]] his Liberals won 199 seats, a loss of 23, but held onto their status as first party. The separatists attained only 35 seats. In November, half a year from the election, Yoshida and Hatoyama met one another and most of the separatists who were loyal to Hatoyama re-joined the Liberal Party. Only eight men refused to return, Bukichi Miki, Ichiro Kono, Takechiyo Matsuda, To Matsunaga, Umekichi Nakamura, Shinjiro Yamamura, Masanosuke Ikeda, and Kaku Ando, who together called themselves the Japan Liberal Party. Others called them \"The Eight Samurai,\" in reference to the new movie [[The Seven Samurai]].\n\nIn January 1954 con-man Masutomi Ito was exposed for perpetrating mass investment fraud, a scheme which eventually led investigators to a ring of shipbuilders who were bribing politicians in exchange for subsidies. Liberal Party Secretary General [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] and Political Affairs Research Committee head Hayato Ikeda were suspected of involvement. A few days earlier Yoshida's Liberals had met with the Reform Party and the Separatist Liberal Party and held negotiations with representatives of each party in the hopes of unifying the three [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning parties. When the talks fell through, Miki saw his chance and linked up with Hatoyama and [[Nobusuke Kishi]] of the Liberal Party as well as Reform Party members Takeo Miki and Tadao Oasa to seek the establishment of a new anti-Yoshida political party. In November 1954 the [[Japan Democratic Party (1954)|Democratic Party]] was constituted with Hatoyama as president, Kishi as Secretary General, and Miki as Chairman of the Executive Council.\n\nNext month Yoshida's cabinet finally resigned en masse and Hatoyama became prime minister. Half of Miki's long-held ambition for a government with Hatoyama as prime minister and himself as Speaker of the House of Representatives had been achieved. However, when the House elected its speaker immediately following the [[1955 Japanese general election|general elections]], all the parties except Miki's Democratic Party banded together and put forward Liberal Party member Shuji Masutani as their joint candidate. Because of this, Miki, the candidate of the governing party who was expected to get elected as a matter of course, ended up being defeated and his dream came to nothing.\n\n== The \"conservative merger\" ==\n[[File:Bukichi Miki.jpg|thumb|right|Bukichi Miki from his days as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]]]]On 13 April 1955 Miki called upon the right-wing political parties to rally together and announced that should rivalries with the Hatoyama cabinet become an obstacle to the merger, the government was prepared to resign en masse.<ref>Mayumi Itoh, The Hatoyama Dynasty: Japanese Political Leadership Through the Generations (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), 127.</ref> At this point Miki had been fretting over the unification of the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]] with its rivals the Rightist Socialists and what's more had been told by his doctor that he had contracted cancer and would live no more than three years.\n\nAt the same time as Miki was striving to reach consensus in the Democratic Party he engaged in manoeuvres within the Liberal Party. On 15 May 1955 he met with Banboku Ono, the Chairman of the Executive Council in the Liberal Party. Ono had once been a close aide to Hatoyama but was superseded by Miki even though Miki had previously been Hatoyama's political enemy, and for that Ono despised Miki more than anyone else. Even so, Miki pleaded with Ono, cleverly appealing to his strong sense of patriotism, and won his support. Then a meeting was held between Miki and Kishi and their Liberal Party counterparts Banboku Ono and Kojiro Ishii and they officially began the process of merging their parties. On the other hand, Reform Party leaders Takeo Miki and Kenzo Matsumura fired back with their argument that conservatives should be represented by two parties rather than only one. As the debate was coming to nothing, Hatoyama blurted out while weeping that his cabinet would have to resign, and panicking at the prospect, they ended up backing the merger.\n\nHowever, the final controversy over who should be selected for the presidency of the new party was no easier. As a result, they put the presidency on the back burner and set up an interim presidential committee, agreeing to choose the president through an election after the party had been formed. Thus, the difficulty-fraught conservative merger was completed, and Japan's first unified right-wing party, the Liberal Democratic Party, was born. Miki, Hatoyama, Ono, and Taketora Ogata shared the interim presidential committee, and five months later Hatoyama was inaugurated as president of the Liberal Democratic Party. On the future of the Liberal Democratic Party, which had gotten off the ground leaving the most vexatious conflicts unresolved, Miki is well known for his assessment that the party \"would be lucky to last two or three years\".<ref>Kent E. Calder, Crisis and Compensation: Public Policy and Political Stability in Japan, 1949-1986 (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1988), 59.</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nMiki was bedridden from April 1956, and his condition gradually worsened. On 4 July he died at his home in [[Meguro, Tokyo]]. The cause of death was stomach cancer. He was 71 years old.\n\nA bronze statue of Miki was constructed near [[Ritsurin Garden]] in his hometown of Takamatsu.\n\n== Famous statements and retorts ==\nDuring the 1917 general elections, in which Miki would be elected for the first time, the Rikken Seiyukai candidate Zenshiro Tsuboya said of Miki in a speech, \"I'm not going to name names, but there is a certain candidate who has two years worth of unpaid rent. He even owes more than one year's worth of debt to the rice merchant. Can such a man really discuss state affairs at the podium of parliament as a representative of our nation? I believe that such a candidate in these circumstances should gracefully decline to run for office.\" At the next town hall meeting Miki hit back, saying \"I've heard that a certain candidate has been going around attacking as disgraceful the fact that a man with debts is running for office. That debt-ridden candidate is I, the humble Bukichi Miki. Because I am poor, I am in debt. Though he was just called a rice merchant, that man is the rice merchant Mr. Yamashita from Yamabuki. It was said that I owe him more than one year's worth of debt, but that's not correct. Actually, I owe him more than two years' worth of debt. I also owe rent, but not two years' worth. To be more precise, the situation is that my landlord has been waiting for payment for more than three years. I want to correct this misinformation about me right now!\" The room burst into laughter and applause and one person shouted \"Nice one, debt king!\" Miki's landlord and the rice merchant Tatsujiro Yamashita were also present at the meeting and after that they both stood up at Miki's urging. Yamashita said, \"I am the rice merchant Yamashita. How about it everyone, will you please support Mr. Miki?\" That was the last time the stunned Zenshiro Tsuboya would bring up Miki's debts.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 7-9.</ref>\n\nDuring the 43rd session of the Imperial Diet which began on 29 June 1920, [[Korekiyo Takahashi]], the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]] in [[Takashi Hara]]'s cabinet who went by the nickname \"Daruma\", was in the process of explaining the naval budget. When Takahashi said \"We will make this into a long-term plan of ten years for the army and eight years for the navy\", Miki shouted out \"Nine years for Daruma!\" This was a very witty statement using the story of the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma|Daruma Daishi]] who faced a wall in China's Shaolin Monastery and after doing zen meditation for nine years, achieved enlightenment. The assemblymen burst into laughter and Takahashi also stopped speaking, looked back at Prime Minister Hara in the ministers' gallery, and smiled wryly. Even Takaaki Kato and Osachi Hamaguchi, up to then well known for their stoic seriousness, famously cracked up in their seats.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 63-64.</ref> Also during the time when Hara was serving as prime minister, a cabinet minister was explaining the aims of a proposed piece of legislation in a somber and monotone voice as if reading a sutra. When the session adjourned Miki jeered \"Next we may burn the incense\", and the assembly burst out laughing.\n\nAt a meeting of MPs from the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]] for deciding party policy towards the [[Hideki Tojo|Tojo]] cabinet's Corporate Restructuring Bill, [[Seigo Nakano]] pointed at the senior members of the IRAPA and remarked \"Swarming around the center of power, I see only sycophants. This will in the end lead to the destruction of our country. The people who are leading Japan astray are all the bootlickers in the IRAPA.\" When the mainstream IRAPA members booed Nakano, Miki abruptly stood up and famously shouted \"Shut up, all you bootlickers!\", and the hecklers immediately fell silent.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 170.</ref>\n\nAt a speaking event Miki attended during the general elections of 1952, a rival office-seeker, Toshichi Fuke, said of Miki \"After the war, we achieved [[Women's suffrage#Japan|equal rights for men and women]], but even so one big-shot candidate keeps four mistresses! Is such an immoral man qualified to be involved in national politics?\" Miki. however, was the next one up to the podium, and he replied \"The person that the impotent candidate who stands before me calls a 'big-shot candidate' is the humble Bukichi Miki. What Bukichi Miki is thinking is, would you all prefer to give your one precious vote to this pitifully weak candidate, or to a big-shot like me? What's more, because I must strive for accuracy, I will go ahead and correct the mathematical errors of the aforementioned weak candidate right now. It was said that I have four mistresses, but actually I have five. Confusing four with five ought to be considered shameful even for a first grader. It seems like he failed to count one. However, all these women have now become old maids and aren't of use to me anymore. Even so, Bukichi Miki could never do something so inhumane as abandon them! Even today I care for them all.\" The crowd roared with laughter and approval.<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 257-259.</ref> Miki kept his five mistresses up to his death, who lived with him and cared for his wife Kaneko. However, he was also a loving husband who had stated, \"The one for whom I have never stopped feeling true affection is definitely my wife Kaneko. It's just that I happened to fall in love with other women.\"<ref>Isamu Togawa, \u5c0f\u8aac\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 44.</ref>\n\nWhile Miki was serving as Chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party, the [[Shiun Maru disaster]] occurred, a deadly collision between two [[Japanese National Railways]] ferries, resulting in the resignation of JNR President Sonosuke Nagasaki. Miki proposed [[Shinji Sogo]], who had a long career as a bureaucrat in the pre-war [[Japanese Government Railways]], to fill his shoes and met him personally to persuade him. At the meeting Miki aggressively approached the wavering Sogo and said \"Our railway department, which has always been like a home to you, is probably on the verge of collapse due to these scandals. Are you so disloyal that you won't even try to stand and fight for your homeland when called upon?\" This led Sogo to answer \"I will never be a traitor!\" and convinced him to take up the post.<ref>[http://www.ifsa.jp/index.php?Gsogoshinji article on Shinji Sogo - Kogaku Shimbun International Foreign Students Association]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Yo Mizuki, \u8aa0\u5fc3\u8aa0\u610f, \u5653\u3092\u3064\u304f: \u81ea\u6c11\u515a\u3092\u751f\u3093\u3060\u7537\u30fb\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u5409\u306e\u751f\u6daf (Tokyo: Nihon Keizai Shinbunsha, 2005).\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091201121520/http://www.pluto.dti.ne.jp/~mor97512/kaku1-9.HTML article on Bukichi Miki] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = President of the Liberal Democratic Party\n| before = New political party\n| years  = 1955-1956, Served alongside: Ichiro Hatoyama, Taketora Ogata, Bamboku Ono\n| after  = Ichiro Hatoyama\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = Chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party\n| before = New political party\n| years  = 1954-1955\n| after  = \"conservative merger\" with Liberal Party\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = Chairman of the Executive Council of the Liberal Party\n| before = New political party\n| years  = 1945-1946\n| after  = Shigeru Yoshida\n}}\n{{succession box \n| title  = Secretary General of the Kenseikai\n| before = Shoju Koyama\n| years  = 1924-1925\n| after  = Takeji Yatsunami\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miki, Bukichi}}\n[[Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Empire of Japan)]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Japan)]]\n[[Category:Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) politicians]]\n[[Category:Japanese lawyers]]\n[[Category:Japanese businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Kagawa Prefecture]]\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Takamatsu, Kagawa]]\n", "name_user": "Hms1103", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added Wikilink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukichi_Miki"}
