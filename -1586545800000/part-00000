It is a retelling of the Biblical account about [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] through to the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Along with the [[ensemble cast]], it marked [[Claude Rains]]'s final film role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] (magi) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King [[Herod the Great]], whose advisers inform him of a [[Messiah]] mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby [[Bethlehem]] as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence--and secretly sends guards to follow them and \"keep [him] informed.\" In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple--[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]--laying their [[Nativity of Jesus|newborn son in a manger]]. Mary states that his name is [[Jesus]]. As [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the local shepherds]] watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to \"take the child,\" and \"flee.\"\n\nThe spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders [[Massacre of the Innocents|the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem]], and dies shortly after being informed that [apparently] \"not one is alive.\" However, Joseph and Mary have successfully [[Flight into Egypt|escaped into Egypt]] with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of [[Nazareth]].\n\nA pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's sons [[Herod Antipas]], but the conflict is quickly quashed. [[Herodian kingdom|Herod's kingdom]] is divided, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]]. Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is \"someone who will never come.\"\n\nMany years later, a prophet named [[John the Baptist]] appears and preaches at the Jordan baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John [[Baptism of Jesus|baptizes him]]. Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious [[Hermit|hermit]]--a personification of [[Satan]]. The Dark Hermit [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus three times]], but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.\n\nHe returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men--[[Judas Iscariot]] and the Galilean fishermen [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]--ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them \"[[Fishers of men|fishers of men]]\". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named [[James the Less|James]]; he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that \"there will come a time to enter.\" They rest at a home in [[Bethany]] occupied by [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and his sisters [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.\n\nThe group soon arrives at [[Capernaum]], where they meet James' brother [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them--after some thought, Matthew does so. In the local [[Synagogue|synagogue]], Jesus teaches again, and miraculously [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|helps a crippled man to walk again]]. Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem priests and [[Pharisees]] are troubled by the continuing influence and preaching of the Baptist, while the governor [[Pontius Pilate]] wishes only to maintain peace. Since the Jordan is ruled by Herod, he allows the priests to inform him. When he hears that the Baptist is speaking of a Messiah, Herod sends soldiers to arrest him. [[Simon the Zealot|A Zealot named Simon]] informs Jesus and his disciples of the Baptist's arrest; he is welcomed as one.\n\nThe fame of Jesus begins to spread across the land--two more men named [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] also join him. In Jerusalem, the priests become suspicious of Jesus and the curing of the cripple, and send a group to Capernaum to investigate--among them the Pharisees [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Herod hears rumors about an army due to the multitudes that follow Jesus, and questions John the Baptist about him. Herod begins to consider killing the Baptist, with his wife's encouragement--she herself is the ex-wife of Herod's brother, and has been attacked by John for being adulterous.\n\nJesus is soon asked to return to Capernaum by another man named [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]. Crowds gather and celebrate his return, something that is noticed by the Pharisees who are present and the returned Dark Hermit. Jesus then defends [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|a woman caught in the act of adultery]], who identifies herself as \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary of Magdalene]]\". Among the crowd that gathers as he moves away is [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|a sick woman who is cured when she touches his clothes]]. Both of these instances cause many to have faith in Jesus.\n\nHerod begins to wonder about Jesus, and the Baptist confirms Jesus' escape from the massacre ordered by Herod's father. Herod then decides to finally [[Beheading of John the Baptist|kill the Baptist]]--the moment of beheading occurs while Salome, Herod's stepdaughter by his wife's first marriage, dances for him. When the Baptist is dead, Herod sends soldiers to arrest Jesus.\n\nJesus gives a [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on a mountain to a great crowd]], while Pilate and the Pharisees hear of many of Jesus' miracles: [[Marriage at Cana|turning water into wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]], and [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. While resting, Jesus asks his disciples who they and others say that he is: they give many answers, and [[Confession of Peter|Peter believes that Jesus is the Messiah]], a response that has Jesus anoint him as \"the rock on which [he] will build [his] church.\"\n\nAt Nazareth, the people [[Hometown rejection of Jesus|refuse to believe in Jesus and his miracles]] and demand to see for themselves by bringing a blind man named Aram and demanding that Jesus make him see. When he does not, the people are disgusted when he calls himself the Son of God, and briefly stone him. Jesus reunites with his mother, along with a sick Lazarus and his sisters. Andrew and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]] escort Lazarus home to Bethany, while Jesus and the others flee from Herod's approaching soldiers, but not before Jesus heals Aram's sight. When informed that Lazarus is dying, Jesus does not go immediately to Bethany, but to the Jordan where the group [[The Lord's Prayer|gives a prayer]]. Andrew and Nathaniel return, informing them that Lazarus has died, and Jesus then goes to Bethany where he [[Resurrection of Lazarus|brings Lazarus back to life]], a miracle that amazes the witnesses Jerusalem citizens but concerns the Pharisees.\n\nSoon after, when Judas questions why Mary Magdalene is [[Anointing of Jesus|anointing Jesus with expensive oil]], he explains that she is preparing him for his death. Jesus then dons a new garment, and [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|rides on a donkey into Jerusalem]]. In the courtyard of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the merchants and money changers away]], and the large crowd prevents the Pharisees from arresting Jesus, an action ordered even though it is [[Passover]]. He teaches in the Temple courtyard, and leaves when Pilate dispatches soldiers to restore peace and close the gates--many of the Temple's crowd are killed as a result.\n\nWhile the disciples gather to prepare and partake in [[Last Supper|an evening meal]], Judas leaves and promises to hand Jesus over to the Pharisees on the condition that no harm comes to him--the Dark Hermit's presence indicates approaching danger. When Judas returns to the meal, Jesus announces to all that [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|one of them will betray him]], that by morning [[Denial of Peter|Peter will deny three times that he even knows Jesus]], and gives a [[Farewell Discourse|farewell discourse]]. Jesus then gives [[Origin of the Eucharist|bread and wine]] to the disciples, and tells Judas before he leaves again to \"do quickly what [he has] to do.\"\n\n[[Agony in the Garden|Jesus then prays at Gethsemane]] while Judas is paid [[Thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of silver]] to lead soldiers to [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]]. When they arrive, [[Kiss of Judas|Judas kisses Jesus]], and Jesus orders Peter to \"put back [his] sword\". Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|put on trial before the Sanhedrin]], and Aram appears as one of the questioned witnesses. Most of the members are present, as Nicodemus--who refuses to take part--notices that many (including Joseph of Arimathea) are absent. Meanwhile, the Hermit is outside and asks the nearby Peter if he knows Jesus--Peter denies it twice and leaves. When [[Caiaphas]] asks Jesus if he is the Christ, Jesus' reply causes the members to condemn him.\n\nThe Pharisees and Caiaphas [[Pilate's court|bring Jesus to a tired Pilate]], who after questioning Jesus--and briefly speaking with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]]--finds no guilt in Jesus. Since Galilee is under Herod's authority, [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus is sent to Herod]], though he and his soldiers merely [[Mocking of Jesus|ridicule him]] and send him back to Pilate. As Jesus is escorted back to Herod, the Hermit continues to observe, and Peter once again denies Jesus, as a remorseful Judas looks on.\n\nIn the morning, [[Ecce homo|Pilate presents Jesus before the assembled crowd]], and the Hermit begins various cries for Jesus to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Pilate offers compromises--that Jesus merely be scourged, and then the release of a prisoner of the crowd's choice (they choose the supposed murderer [[Barabbas]] instead. Pilate then asks Jesus if he has anything to say; Jesus merely states that his kingdom is \"not of this world,\" something that the Hermit and others claim is a challenge of the authority of Rome the Roman emperor. With no other choice, Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus to be crucified.\n\nJesus then carries his cross [[Via Dolorosa|through Jerusalem]] while the crowd looks on. When he collapses, [[Saint Veronica|a woman wipes his face]] and he reassures to the women of Jerusalem. Soon, the soldiers allow a man named [[Simon of Cyrene]] to help Jesus carry the cross when no one else will. At [[Golgotha]], Jesus is stripped and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|nailed to the cross]], which is then raised between those of two other men while Judas throws his silver into the Temple and throws himself into the fire of the nearby altar. He asks God to \"forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" and leaves his mother in the care of John. While one of the thieves asks Jesus to save them, the other accepts his punishment and asks for Jesus to remember him, a promise that Jesus give to him. As the sky darkens, Jesus ask why God has forsaken him, is offered wine in a sponge, and dies before a storm emerges--the centurion states that \"truly this man was the son of God\" as an earthquake begins.\n\nPeter mourns Jesus while he is laid to rest in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. The Pharisees ask for Pilate to place guards around the tomb and seal it to prevent a possible theft of the corpse that could potentially fulfill a prophecy of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; Pilate agrees, but on the morning of the third day the guards discover the tomb is open and empty. Meanwhile, despite Thomas' weakened faith, Mary Magdalene--along with Peter and others--recall the prophecy and run to see the empty tomb. Word quickly spreads throughout Jerusalem, the miraculous event bewildering the Pharisees. Caiaphas claims that \"the whole thing will be forgotten in a week,\" while an elder scribe doubts this.\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascends to heaven]] before his disciples, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others, leaving them with his final commands as a clouds engulfs him. He then states that he will always be with them, \"even unto the end of the world.\"\n\n==Cast==\nThe major roles in the movie were following:\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as [[Mary mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Martin Landau]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as \"The Dark Hermit\" (a personification of [[Satan]])\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as [[James the Just]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Joanna Dunham]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as \"Old Aram\"\n\nSmaller roles (some only a few seconds) were played by [[Michael Ansara]], [[Ina Balin]], [[Carroll Baker]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Victor Buono]], [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]], [[Richard Conte]], [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]], [[Jamie Farr]], [[David Hedison]], [[Van Heflin]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Mark Lenard]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[John Lupton]], [[Janet Margolin]], [[Sal Mineo]], [[Nehemiah Persoff]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Gary Raymond]], [[Marian Seldes]], [[David Sheiner]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]], [[John Wayne]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Cyril Delevanti]], [[Michael Tolan]], [[Richard Bakalyan]], and [[Marc Cavell (actor)|Marc Cavell]].\n\n==Pre-production==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' originated as a U.S. radio series in 1947, half-hour episodes inspired by [[gospel|the Gospel]]s. The series was adapted into a 1949 novel by [[Fulton Oursler]], a senior editor at [[Reader's Digest]].<ref name=\"HHS\">Medved, Harry & Michael. \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame.\" Perigree Books, 1984. {{ISBN|0-399-50714-0}}</ref> [[Darryl F.

Stevens created a company, \"The Greatest Story Productions\", to film the novel<ref name=\"GI\"/> and Fox set a budget of $10 million, twice their previous biggest.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Three Epics Based on Christ|page=20|date=November 26, 1958|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n247/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greatest-Story-1960.jpg|left|thumb|Pre-production poster from 1960, with [[John Wayne]] as the Centurion]]\nThe screenplay took two years to write. Stevens collaborated with [[Ivan Moffat]] and then with [[James Lee Barrett]]. It was the only time Stevens received screenplay credit for a film he directed.<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Reginald Rose]] were considered but neither participated. The poet [[Carl Sandburg]] was solicited, though it is not certain if any of his contributions were included. Sandburg, however, did receive screen credit for \"creative association.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>The movie's opening credits include: ''Screenplay by James Lee Barrett and George Stevens, based on the Books of the Old and New Testaments, Other Ancient Writings, the Writings of Fulton Oursler and Henry Denker, and in Creative Association with Carl Sandburg'' (see ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 136)</ref>\n\nFinancial excesses began to grow during pre-production. Stevens commissioned French artist [[Andr\u00e9 Girard (1901-1968)|Andr\u00e9 Girard]] to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards. Stevens also traveled to the Vatican to see [[Pope John XXIII]] for advice.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nIn August 1961, 20th Century Fox withdrew from the project, noting that $2.3 million had been spent without any footage being shot. Stevens was given two years to find another studio or 20th Century Fox would reclaim its rights. Stevens moved the film to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[MGM]] proceeded with their own 1961 Technicolor epic about the life of Christ, ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, which was filmed in Spain, and when released was nearly an hour shorter than ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.\n\n==Casting==\nFor ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s dramatic films.<ref>Walker, John. \"Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies.\" HarperCollins, 2001. {{ISBN|0-06-093507-3}}</ref> Stevens wanted an actor unknown to international audiences, free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public.<ref>''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 138</ref>\n\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' featured an ensemble of well-known actors, many of them in brief, even cameo, appearances. Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman [[centurion]] who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12795&mainArticleId=202389|title=The Greatest Story Ever Told|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>\"It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of 'Spot the Star', and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard 'Walk of Fame'.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\n==Production==\nStevens shot ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

Cinematographer [[William C. Mellor]] had a fatal heart attack during production; [[Loyal Griggs]], who won an [[Academy Award]] for his cinematography on Stevens\u2019 1953 Western classic ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', was brought in to replace him. Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMuch of the production was shot during the winter of 1962\u20131963, when Arizona had heavy snow. Actor [[David Sheiner]], who played James the Elder, quipped in an interview about the snowdrifts: \"I thought we were shooting ''[[Nanook of the North]]''.\"<ref>\"Several hundred volunteers . . braved the elements with shovels, wheelbarrows, bulldozers, and fifty butane flame throwers to remove the snow from the expensive replica of the Holy Land.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 140</ref> Stevens was also under pressure to hurry the John the Baptist sequence, which was shot at the Glen Canyon area \u2013 it was scheduled to become [[Lake Powell]] with the completion of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and the production held up the project.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nStevens brought in two veteran filmmakers. [[Jean Negulesco]] filmed sequences in the Jerusalem streets and the Nativity scenes, while [[David Lean]] shot the prologue featuring Herod the Great.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Lean cast Claude Rains as Herod.<ref>Skal, David J. \"Claude Rains: An Actor\u2019s Voice.\" University Press of Kentucky, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2432-2}}</ref>\n\nBy the time shooting was completed in August 1963, Stevens had amassed six million feet of [[Ultra Panavision 70]] film (about 1829&nbsp;km or 1136 miles, roughly the radius of the Moon). The budget ran to $20 million (equivalent to $142 million in 2010) plus additional editing and promotion charges,<ref name=\"Shame p. 142\">''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 142</ref> making it the most expensive film shot in the U.S.<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>\"Such giants as ''Cleopatra'' and ''Lawrence of Arabia'' did boast bigger budgets, but they were shot on foreign soil.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\nThe film was advertised on its first run as being shown in [[Cinerama]]. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe marketing campaign included exhibits created for churches and Sunday schools, department stores, primary and secondary schools. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] put together a traveling exhibition of props, costumes and photographs that toured museums around the country.  Promotional items made available to groups identified for [[market segmentation]] included school study guides, children's books and a reprint of the original novel by Oursler. Previews of the film were shown to leading industrialists, psychologists, government officials, religious leaders and officials from the Boy and Girl Scout organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maresco |first1=Peter A. |title=Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ: Market Segmentation, Mass Marketing and Promotion, and the Internet |journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |date=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.8.1.002}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' premiered 15 February 1965, 18 months after filming wrapped, at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City. Critical reaction toward the movie was divided once it premiered. In its favor, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"a big, powerful moving picture demonstrating vast cinematic resource.\" ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated: \"George Stevens has created a novel, reverent and important film with his view of this crucial event in the history of mankind.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\nHowever, [[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"The most distracting nonsense is the pop-up of familiar faces in so-called cameo roles, jarring the illusion.\" [[Shana Alexander]] in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' stated: \"The pace was so stupefying that I felt not uplifted \u2013 but sandbagged!\"<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] \u2013 later notorious as the frequently scathing theater and film critic of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' \u2013 wrote: \"God is unlucky in ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.

It is a retelling of the Biblical account about [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] through to the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Along with the [[ensemble cast]], it marked [[Claude Rains]]'s final film role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] (magi) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King [[Herod the Great]], whose advisers inform him of a [[Messiah]] mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby [[Bethlehem]] as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence--and secretly sends guards to follow them and \"keep [him] informed.\" In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple--[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]--laying their [[Nativity of Jesus|newborn son in a manger]]. Mary states that his name is [[Jesus]]. As [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the local shepherds]] watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to \"take the child,\" and \"flee.\"\n\nThe spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders [[Massacre of the Innocents|the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem]], and dies shortly after being informed that [apparently] \"not one is alive.\" However, Joseph and Mary have successfully [[Flight into Egypt|escaped into Egypt]] with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of [[Nazareth]].\n\nA pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's sons [[Herod Antipas]], but the conflict is quickly quashed. [[Herodian kingdom|Herod's kingdom]] is divided, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]]. Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is \"someone who will never come.\"\n\nMany years later, a prophet named [[John the Baptist]] appears and preaches at the Jordan baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John [[Baptism of Jesus|baptizes him]]. Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious [[Hermit|hermit]]--a personification of [[Satan]]. The Dark Hermit [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus three times]], but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.\n\nHe returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men--[[Judas Iscariot]] and the Galilean fishermen [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]--ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them \"[[Fishers of men|fishers of men]]\". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named [[James the Less|James]]; he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that \"there will come a time to enter.\" They rest at a home in [[Bethany]] occupied by [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and his sisters [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.\n\nThe group soon arrives at [[Capernaum]], where they meet James' brother [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them--after some thought, Matthew does so. In the local [[Synagogue|synagogue]], Jesus teaches again, and miraculously [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|helps a crippled man to walk again]]. Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem priests and [[Pharisees]] are troubled by the continuing influence and preaching of the Baptist, while the governor [[Pontius Pilate]] wishes only to maintain peace. Since the Jordan is ruled by Herod, he allows the priests to inform him. When he hears that the Baptist is speaking of a Messiah, Herod sends soldiers to arrest him. [[Simon the Zealot|A Zealot named Simon]] informs Jesus and his disciples of the Baptist's arrest; he is welcomed as one.\n\nThe fame of Jesus begins to spread across the land--two more men named [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] also join him. In Jerusalem, the priests become suspicious of Jesus and the curing of the cripple, and send a group to Capernaum to investigate--among them the Pharisees [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Herod hears rumors about an army due to the multitudes that follow Jesus, and questions John the Baptist about him. Herod begins to consider killing the Baptist, with his wife's encouragement--she herself is the ex-wife of Herod's brother, and has been attacked by John for being adulterous.\n\nJesus is soon asked to return to Capernaum by another man named [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]. Crowds gather and celebrate his return, something that is noticed by the Pharisees who are present and the returned Dark Hermit. Jesus then defends [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|a woman caught in the act of adultery]], who identifies herself as \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary of Magdalene]]\". Among the crowd that gathers as he moves away is [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|a sick woman who is cured when she touches his clothes]]. Both of these instances cause many to have faith in Jesus.\n\nHerod begins to wonder about Jesus, and the Baptist confirms Jesus' escape from the massacre ordered by Herod's father. Herod then decides to finally [[Beheading of John the Baptist|kill the Baptist]]--the moment of beheading occurs while Salome, Herod's stepdaughter by his wife's first marriage, dances for him. When the Baptist is dead, Herod sends soldiers to arrest Jesus.\n\nJesus gives a [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on a mountain to a great crowd]], while Pilate and the Pharisees hear of many of Jesus' miracles: [[Marriage at Cana|turning water into wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]], and [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. While resting, Jesus asks his disciples who they and others say that he is: they give many answers, and [[Confession of Peter|Peter believes that Jesus is the Messiah]], a response that has Jesus anoint him as \"the rock on which [he] will build [his] church.\"\n\nAt Nazareth, the people [[Hometown rejection of Jesus|refuse to believe in Jesus and his miracles]] and demand to see for themselves by bringing a blind man named Aram and demanding that Jesus make him see. When he does not, the people are disgusted when he calls himself the Son of God, and briefly stone him. Jesus reunites with his mother, along with a sick Lazarus and his sisters. Andrew and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]] escort Lazarus home to Bethany, while Jesus and the others flee from Herod's approaching soldiers, but not before Jesus heals Aram's sight. When informed that Lazarus is dying, Jesus does not go immediately to Bethany, but to the Jordan where the group [[The Lord's Prayer|gives a prayer]]. Andrew and Nathaniel return, informing them that Lazarus has died, and Jesus then goes to Bethany where he [[Resurrection of Lazarus|brings Lazarus back to life]], a miracle that amazes the witnesses Jerusalem citizens but concerns the Pharisees.\n\nSoon after, when Judas questions why Mary Magdalene is [[Anointing of Jesus|anointing Jesus with expensive oil]], he explains that she is preparing him for his death. Jesus then dons a new garment, and [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|rides on a donkey into Jerusalem]]. In the courtyard of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the merchants and money changers away]], and the large crowd prevents the Pharisees from arresting Jesus, an action ordered even though it is [[Passover]]. He teaches in the Temple courtyard, and leaves when Pilate dispatches soldiers to restore peace and close the gates--many of the Temple's crowd are killed as a result.\n\nWhile the disciples gather to prepare and partake in [[Last Supper|an evening meal]], Judas leaves and promises to hand Jesus over to the Pharisees on the condition that no harm comes to him--the Dark Hermit's presence indicates approaching danger. When Judas returns to the meal, Jesus announces to all that [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|one of them will betray him]], that by morning [[Denial of Peter|Peter will deny three times that he even knows Jesus]], and gives a [[Farewell Discourse|farewell discourse]]. Jesus then gives [[Origin of the Eucharist|bread and wine]] to the disciples, and tells Judas before he leaves again to \"do quickly what [he has] to do.\"\n\n[[Agony in the Garden|Jesus then prays at Gethsemane]] while Judas is paid [[Thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of silver]] to lead soldiers to [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]]. When they arrive, [[Kiss of Judas|Judas kisses Jesus]], and Jesus orders Peter to \"put back [his] sword\". Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|put on trial before the Sanhedrin]], and Aram appears as one of the questioned witnesses. Most of the members are present, as Nicodemus--who refuses to take part--notices that many (including Joseph of Arimathea) are absent. Meanwhile, the Hermit is outside and asks the nearby Peter if he knows Jesus--Peter denies it twice and leaves. When [[Caiaphas]] asks Jesus if he is the Christ, Jesus' reply causes the members to condemn him.\n\nThe Pharisees and Caiaphas [[Pilate's court|bring Jesus to a tired Pilate]], who after questioning Jesus--and briefly speaking with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]]--finds no guilt in Jesus. Since Galilee is under Herod's authority, [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus is sent to Herod]], though he and his soldiers merely [[Mocking of Jesus|ridicule him]] and send him back to Pilate. As Jesus is escorted back to Herod, the Hermit continues to observe, and Peter once again denies Jesus, as a remorseful Judas looks on.\n\nIn the morning, [[Ecce homo|Pilate presents Jesus before the assembled crowd]], and the Hermit begins various cries for Jesus to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Pilate offers compromises--that Jesus merely be scourged, and then the release of a prisoner of the crowd's choice (they choose the supposed murderer [[Barabbas]] instead. Pilate then asks Jesus if he has anything to say; Jesus merely states that his kingdom is \"not of this world,\" something that the Hermit and others claim is a challenge of the authority of Rome the Roman emperor. With no other choice, Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus to be crucified.\n\nJesus then carries his cross [[Via Dolorosa|through Jerusalem]] while the crowd looks on. When he collapses, [[Saint Veronica|a woman wipes his face]] and he reassures to the women of Jerusalem. Soon, the soldiers allow a man named [[Simon of Cyrene]] to help Jesus carry the cross when no one else will. At [[Golgotha]], Jesus is stripped and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|nailed to the cross]], which is then raised between those of two other men while Judas throws his silver into the Temple and throws himself into the fire of the nearby altar. He asks God to \"forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" and leaves his mother in the care of John. While one of the thieves asks Jesus to save them, the other accepts his punishment and asks for Jesus to remember him, a promise that Jesus give to him. As the sky darkens, Jesus ask why God has forsaken him, is offered wine in a sponge, and dies before a storm emerges--the centurion states that \"truly this man was the son of God\" as an earthquake begins.\n\nPeter mourns Jesus while he is laid to rest in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. The Pharisees ask for Pilate to place guards around the tomb and seal it to prevent a possible theft of the corpse that could potentially fulfill a prophecy of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; Pilate agrees, but on the morning of the third day the guards discover the tomb is open and empty. Meanwhile, despite Thomas' weakened faith, Mary Magdalene--along with Peter and others--recall the prophecy and run to see the empty tomb. Word quickly spreads throughout Jerusalem, the miraculous event bewildering the Pharisees. Caiaphas claims that \"the whole thing will be forgotten in a week,\" while an elder scribe doubts this.\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascends to heaven]] before his disciples, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others, leaving them with his final commands as a clouds engulfs him. He then states that he will always be with them, \"even unto the end of the world.\"\n\n==Cast==\nThe major roles in the movie were following:\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as [[Mary mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Martin Landau]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as \"The Dark Hermit\" (a personification of [[Satan]])\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as [[James the Just]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Joanna Dunham]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as \"Old Aram\"\n\nSmaller roles (some only a few seconds) were played by [[Michael Ansara]], [[Ina Balin]], [[Carroll Baker]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Victor Buono]], [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]], [[Richard Conte]], [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]], [[Jamie Farr]], [[David Hedison]], [[Van Heflin]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Mark Lenard]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[John Lupton]], [[Janet Margolin]], [[Sal Mineo]], [[Nehemiah Persoff]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Gary Raymond]], [[Marian Seldes]], [[David Sheiner]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]], [[John Wayne]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Cyril Delevanti]], [[Michael Tolan]], [[Richard Bakalyan]], and [[Marc Cavell (actor)|Marc Cavell]].\n\n==Pre-production==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' originated as a U.S. radio series in 1947, half-hour episodes inspired by [[gospel|the Gospel]]s. The series was adapted into a 1949 novel by [[Fulton Oursler]], a senior editor at [[Reader's Digest]].<ref name=\"HHS\">Medved, Harry & Michael. \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame.\" Perigree Books, 1984. {{ISBN|0-399-50714-0}}</ref> [[Darryl F.

Stevens created a company, \"The Greatest Story Productions\", to film the novel<ref name=\"GI\"/> and Fox set a budget of $10 million, twice their previous biggest.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Three Epics Based on Christ|page=20|date=November 26, 1958|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n247/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greatest-Story-1960.jpg|left|thumb|Pre-production poster from 1960, with [[John Wayne]] as the Centurion]]\nThe screenplay took two years to write. Stevens collaborated with [[Ivan Moffat]] and then with [[James Lee Barrett]]. It was the only time Stevens received screenplay credit for a film he directed.<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Reginald Rose]] were considered but neither participated. The poet [[Carl Sandburg]] was solicited, though it is not certain if any of his contributions were included. Sandburg, however, did receive screen credit for \"creative association.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>The movie's opening credits include: ''Screenplay by James Lee Barrett and George Stevens, based on the Books of the Old and New Testaments, Other Ancient Writings, the Writings of Fulton Oursler and Henry Denker, and in Creative Association with Carl Sandburg'' (see ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 136)</ref>\n\nFinancial excesses began to grow during pre-production. Stevens commissioned French artist [[Andr\u00e9 Girard (1901-1968)|Andr\u00e9 Girard]] to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards. Stevens also traveled to the Vatican to see [[Pope John XXIII]] for advice.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nIn August 1961, 20th Century Fox withdrew from the project, noting that $2.3 million had been spent without any footage being shot. Stevens was given two years to find another studio or 20th Century Fox would reclaim its rights. Stevens moved the film to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[MGM]] proceeded with their own 1961 Technicolor epic about the life of Christ, ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, which was filmed in Spain, and when released was nearly an hour shorter than ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.\n\n==Casting==\nFor ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s dramatic films.<ref>Walker, John. \"Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies.\" HarperCollins, 2001. {{ISBN|0-06-093507-3}}</ref> Stevens wanted an actor unknown to international audiences, free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public.<ref>''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 138</ref>\n\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' featured an ensemble of well-known actors, many of them in brief, even cameo, appearances. Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman [[centurion]] who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12795&mainArticleId=202389|title=The Greatest Story Ever Told|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>\"It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of 'Spot the Star', and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard 'Walk of Fame'.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\n==Production==\nStevens shot ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

Mellor]] had a fatal heart attack during production; [[Loyal Griggs]], who won an [[Academy Award]] for his cinematography on Stevens\u2019 1953 Western classic ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', was brought in to replace him. Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMuch of the production was shot during the winter of 1962\u20131963, when Arizona had heavy snow. Actor [[David Sheiner]], who played James the Elder, quipped in an interview about the snowdrifts: \"I thought we were shooting ''[[Nanook of the North]]''.\"<ref>\"Several hundred volunteers . . braved the elements with shovels, wheelbarrows, bulldozers, and fifty butane flame throwers to remove the snow from the expensive replica of the Holy Land.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 140</ref> Stevens was also under pressure to hurry the John the Baptist sequence, which was shot at the Glen Canyon area \u2013 it was scheduled to become [[Lake Powell]] with the completion of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and the production held up the project.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nStevens brought in two veteran filmmakers. [[Jean Negulesco]] filmed sequences in the Jerusalem streets and the Nativity scenes, while [[David Lean]] shot the prologue featuring Herod the Great.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Lean cast Claude Rains as Herod.<ref>Skal, David J. \"Claude Rains: An Actor\u2019s Voice.\" University Press of Kentucky, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2432-2}}</ref>\n\nBy the time shooting was completed in August 1963, Stevens had amassed six million feet of [[Ultra Panavision 70]] film (about 1829&nbsp;km or 1136 miles, roughly the radius of the Moon). The budget ran to $20 million (equivalent to $142 million in 2010) plus additional editing and promotion charges,<ref name=\"Shame p. 142\">''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 142</ref> making it the most expensive film shot in the U.S.<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>\"Such giants as ''Cleopatra'' and ''Lawrence of Arabia'' did boast bigger budgets, but they were shot on foreign soil.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\nThe film was advertised on its first run as being shown in [[Cinerama]]. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe marketing campaign included exhibits created for churches and Sunday schools, department stores, primary and secondary schools. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] put together a traveling exhibition of props, costumes and photographs that toured museums around the country.  Promotional items made available to groups identified for [[market segmentation]] included school study guides, children's books and a reprint of the original novel by Oursler. Previews of the film were shown to leading industrialists, psychologists, government officials, religious leaders and officials from the Boy and Girl Scout organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maresco |first1=Peter A. |title=Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ: Market Segmentation, Mass Marketing and Promotion, and the Internet |journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |date=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.8.1.002}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' premiered 15 February 1965, 18 months after filming wrapped, at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City. Critical reaction toward the movie was divided once it premiered. In its favor, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"a big, powerful moving picture demonstrating vast cinematic resource.\" ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated: \"George Stevens has created a novel, reverent and important film with his view of this crucial event in the history of mankind.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\nHowever, [[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"The most distracting nonsense is the pop-up of familiar faces in so-called cameo roles, jarring the illusion.\" [[Shana Alexander]] in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' stated: \"The pace was so stupefying that I felt not uplifted \u2013 but sandbagged!\"<ref name=\"GI\"/> And [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] \u2013 later notorious as the frequently scathing theater and film critic of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' \u2013 wrote: \"God is unlucky in ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.

The Islanders are cut off from the outside world and are under constant video surveillance. To survive in the villa, the Islanders must be in a relationship with another Islander. The Islanders couple up for the first time on first impressions but they are later forced to \"re-couple\" at special ceremonies in which they can choose to remain with their current partners or to switch partners. At the villa, the couples must share a bed for sleeping and are permitted to talk with other Islanders at any time, allowing them to get to know everyone.<ref name=\"format 2\">{{cite web |last1=Phillips |first1=Hedy |title=So You've Been Watching Love Island and Have a Few Questions \u2014 Let Us Help |url=https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/How-Does-Love-Island-Work-46382406 |website=popsugar.com |publisher=POPSUGAR |accessdate=April 4, 2020 |date=July 16, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> While in the villa, each Islander has his or her own telephone, with which they can contact other Islanders via [[SMS|text]] and can receive text messages informing them of the latest challenges, dumpings, and re-couplings.

The Islanders are cut off from the outside world and are under constant video surveillance. To survive in the villa, the Islanders must be in a relationship with another Islander. The Islanders couple up for the first time on first impressions but they are later forced to \"re-couple\" at special ceremonies in which they can choose to remain with their current partners or to switch partners. At the villa, the couples must share a bed for sleeping and are permitted to talk with other Islanders at any time, allowing them to get to know everyone.<ref name=\"format 2\">{{cite web |last1=Phillips |first1=Hedy |title=So You've Been Watching Love Island and Have a Few Questions \u2014 Let Us Help |url=https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/How-Does-Love-Island-Work-46382406 |website=popsugar.com |publisher=POPSUGAR |accessdate=April 4, 2020 |date=July 16, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> While in the villa, each Islander has his or her own telephone, with which they can contact other Islanders via [[SMS|text]] and can receive text messages informing them of the latest challenges, dumpings, and re-couplings. The Islanders are presented with many games and challenges that are designed to test their physical and mental abilities, after which the winners are sometimes presented with special prizes, such as a night at the [[#Villa|Hideaway]] or a special date.<ref name=\"format\">{{cite web |last1=Moylan |first1=Brian |title=What to Know About Love Island Before Its U.S. Debut |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/how-does-love-island-work-us-premiere-date.html |website=vulture.com |publisher=Vulture |accessdate=April 4, 2020 |date=July 8, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIslanders can be eliminated, or \"dumped\", for several reasons; these include remaining single after a re-coupling and by public vote through the ''Love Island'' [[mobile app]].

Either it stays in Paris, or it does not exist. It is not within the power of any nation to steal fashion creativity, for not only does it function quite spontaneously, also it is the product of a tradition maintained by a large body of skilled men and women in a variety of crafts and trades.\" Kawamura explains that the survival of the French fashion industry was critical to the survival of France, stating, \"Export of a single dress by a leading couturier enabled the country to buy ten tons of coal, and a liter of perfume was worth two tons of petrol\" (page 46).</ref> His sister, Catherine (1917\u20132008), served as a member of the [[French Resistance]], was captured by the [[Gestapo]], and sent to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]], where she was incarcerated until her liberation in May 1945.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gitta |last=Sereny |title=The Healing Wound: Experiences and Reflections, Germany, 1938\u20132001 |publisher=W.

She Was in a relationship with  lawyer, then mayor of Dunkirk [[Charles Valantin]]. Together they formed an unorthodox couple for that period of time; lived together without being married. \n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in [[Catillon-sur-Sambre]] ([[Nord (French department)|Nord Department]]), D\u00e9marez had a quite modest background, coming from a below middle-class family of [[Textile manufacturing|textile workers]] living in a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. She obtains her first diploma from the hamlet's own primary school on August [[1890]]<ref>''Tourisme Cambr\u00e9sis,'' cit\u00e9 dans la bibliographie</ref>. She quits school to follow her parents' path as textile workers but later, she finds out that she is able to go back to school so she takes her chances<ref name=\":0\">D\u00e9marez (Olympe), Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis, (1878-1964) - Profession lib\u00e9rale - Avocate \u00bb, dans Bernard Schaeffer, ''Dictionnaire des Femmes du Nord'', Publi-Nord, 2003, p.162-164.</ref>. \u00a0\n\nIn [[1898]] D\u00e9marez is 20 years old, it is also the year of her debut in teaching. She starts working 180 kilometers away from her birthplace, which is rather out of ordinary considering the place and time and the difficulty to travel. She starts working as a school teacher first in Petit-Fort-Philippe ([[Gravelines|Graveline]]'s hamlet) from [[1898]] to [[1901]] and then in [[Dunkirk]] from [[1902]] to [[1908]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nAt the age of 30, she quits teaching and the security that comes with the teacher profession, following her inclination for studying law, while these studies were just opening for the female students and even though they had the right to study it wasn\u2019t easy to find other female students. To support herself and to finance her studies, she starts working as a secretary at the office of Charles Valentin, a young 27 years old lawyer, recently registered at the Dunkirk [[bar association]]<ref name=\":1\">Christian Vincent, \u00ab Olympe Desmarez, premi\u00e8re avocate du Nord \u00bb, dans ''Cent ans de vie dans la r\u00e9gion, Tome 1 \u02d0 1900-1914'', La Voix du Nord \u00e9ditions, 17 novembre 1998, p.85</ref>. \n\nAfter obtaining her associate\u2019s degree in law, in [[1913]] she obtains her bachelor\u2019s degree from law school. \u00a0\n\nHer relationship with Charles Valentin evolves \u02d0 he is no longer just his employer but also her lover and her companion. Despite this cohabitation lifestyle, which is not really common in their [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] entourage, the couple is very honorably respected in [[Flanders]]. On September 20, [[1939]], Charles Valentin was victim of a serious traffic accident in the [[Lille]] suburbs. Despite the care of Oscar Lambret, a prominent Lille surgeon, his condition worsened. Olympe D\u00e9marez then asked the deputy mayor of Lille Charles Saint-Venant to marry them. Her husband died shortly after the ceremony. The motivations of the two spouses are not known, but it is possible to suppose the will of Olympe D\u00e9marez to remain faithful to this man by bearing his name and the will of Charles Valentin to secure the future of the woman who gave him all during their 25 years of companionship allowing her officially as his wife, to inherit from her husband. \n\nDuring [[World War II|WWII]] D\u00e9marez goes back to her hometown and takes care of the [[Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany|refugee children]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nAfter the [[French Liberation]], Dunkirk\u2019s mayor engages her to reorganize the city\u2019s archives<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nWomen acquired the right to vote in [[1944]], and voted for the first time in the municipal elections of April [[1945]] ([[Women's suffrage|Women's right to vote]]). Olympe D\u00e9marez-Valentin, widow of the former mayor, becomes the first woman to be elected to the municipal council of Dunkirk at the end of these first elections open to women, which means being able to vote and to be able to get elected.\u00a0 Which was great for D\u00e9marez to get elected at the first opportunity. \u00a0\n\nShe continued to participate in public meetings ant to the events organized by her political family during ceremonies of homage to her husband on the anniversary of his death<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nD\u00e9marez died on 5 September [[1964]] at the age of 86<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\n== Career ==\nD\u00e9marez started to work as a school teacher first in Petit-Fort-Philippe ([[Gravelines|Graveline]]'s hamlet) from [[1898]] to [[1901]] and then in [[Dunkirk]] from [[1902]] to [[1908]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nIt was February 2nd, 1914, before the Douai Court of Appeal, D\u00e9marez was declared officially a lawyer, 14 years after [[Jeanne Chauvin]] first female lawyer in France<ref name=\":1\" />.  After D\u00e9marez there wasn't any other (new) female lawyer in France until 1920<ref>{{Cite book|last=Veroon|first=Marcel|title=Histoire du Barreau de Lille|publisher=L'ordre des avocats au barreau de Lille|year=1998|location=Lille|pages=164}}</ref>.

She Was in a relationship with  lawyer, then mayor of Dunkirk [[Charles Valantin]]. Together they formed an unorthodox couple for that period of time; lived together without being married. \n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in [[Catillon-sur-Sambre]] ([[Nord (French department)|Nord Department]]), D\u00e9marez had a quite modest background, coming from a below middle-class family of [[Textile manufacturing|textile workers]] living in a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. She obtains her first diploma from the hamlet's own primary school on August [[1890]]<ref>''Tourisme Cambr\u00e9sis,'' cit\u00e9 dans la bibliographie</ref>. She quits school to follow her parents' path as textile workers but later, she finds out that she is able to go back to school so she takes her chances<ref name=\":0\">D\u00e9marez (Olympe), Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis, (1878-1964) - Profession lib\u00e9rale - Avocate \u00bb, dans Bernard Schaeffer, ''Dictionnaire des Femmes du Nord'', Publi-Nord, 2003, p.162-164.</ref>. \u00a0\n\nIn [[1898]] D\u00e9marez is 20 years old, it is also the year of her debut in teaching. She starts working 180 kilometers away from her birthplace, which is rather out of ordinary considering the place and time and the difficulty to travel. She starts working as a school teacher first in Petit-Fort-Philippe ([[Gravelines|Graveline]]'s hamlet) from [[1898]] to [[1901]] and then in [[Dunkirk]] from [[1902]] to [[1908]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nAt the age of 30, she quits teaching and the security that comes with the teacher profession, following her inclination for studying law, while these studies were just opening for the female students and even though they had the right to study it wasn\u2019t easy to find other female students. To support herself and to finance her studies, she starts working as a secretary at the office of Charles Valentin, a young 27 years old lawyer, recently registered at the Dunkirk [[bar association]]<ref name=\":1\">Christian Vincent, \u00ab Olympe Desmarez, premi\u00e8re avocate du Nord \u00bb, dans ''Cent ans de vie dans la r\u00e9gion, Tome 1 \u02d0 1900-1914'', La Voix du Nord \u00e9ditions, 17 novembre 1998, p.85</ref>. \n\nAfter obtaining her associate\u2019s degree in law, in [[1913]] she obtains her bachelor\u2019s degree from law school. \u00a0\n\nHer relationship with Charles Valentin evolves \u02d0 he is no longer just his employer but also her lover and her companion. Despite this cohabitation lifestyle, which is not really common in their [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] entourage, the couple is very honorably respected in [[Flanders]]. On September 20, [[1939]], Charles Valentin was victim of a serious traffic accident in the [[Lille]] suburbs. Despite the care of Oscar Lambret, a prominent Lille surgeon, his condition worsened. Olympe D\u00e9marez then asked the deputy mayor of Lille Charles Saint-Venant to marry them. Her husband died shortly after the ceremony. The motivations of the two spouses are not known, but it is possible to suppose the will of Olympe D\u00e9marez to remain faithful to this man by bearing his name and the will of Charles Valentin to secure the future of the woman who gave him all during their 25 years of companionship allowing her officially as his wife, to inherit from her husband. \n\nDuring [[World War II|WWII]] D\u00e9marez goes back to her hometown and takes care of the [[Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany|refugee children]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nAfter the [[French Liberation]], Dunkirk\u2019s mayor engages her to reorganize the city\u2019s archives<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0\n\nWomen acquired the right to vote in [[1944]], and voted for the first time in the municipal elections of April [[1945]] ([[Women's suffrage|Women's right to vote]]).

Historical Notes\", ''Tidings'' online, April 2020].</ref> In Anglo-Saxon times, she notes, it was part of the manor of Earsham, belonging to [[Stigand]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (1052-1070): \"When the Saxon Archbishop Stigand quarrelled with William the Conqueror, his lands, including Stockton, were confiscated by the Crown\".\n\nIn 1140 King Stephen granted Stockton, including the manors of [[Ellingham]], [[Geldeston]], [[Gillingham]], [[Kirby Cane]], Winston and Wyndale (Windle), with the right to hold court and set up a gallows, to Hugh [[Bigod]], the newly created Earl of Norfolk. In 1178, Hugh\u2019s son Ralph, the next owner, obtained exclusive fishing rights on the Waveney from Stockton to Shipmeadow, and the right to cut reeds, like those used to thatch the church (it still has a thatched roof today), and to cut rushes for strewing the floors.<ref>[https://tidings-norfolk.org/2020/02/24/stockton-some-historical-notes/ \"Stockton.

The \u201cStockton Town Book\u201d, a manuscript volume containing churchwardens\u2019 accounts for the years 1625-1712, has also been preserved. \n\nAmong the information included in the Town Book that for the [[English Civil War]] (1642-1649) provides a glimpse of a small Norfolk village at the time. Two villagers and the rector went away to fight. Thomas Bande was paid 10 shillings in 1640 \u201cfor being content to be a soldier for the Town\u201d; John Bird, parish clerk, received 15 shillings when \u201cimpressed\u201d for the same purpose in 1643, and his wife was supported by the parish until he returned \u201cmaimed from [[Naseby]] fight\u201d (14 June 1645).

Historical Notes\", ''Tidings'' online, April 2020].</ref> In Anglo-Saxon times, she notes, it was part of the manor of Earsham, belonging to [[Stigand]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (1052-1070): \"When the Saxon Archbishop Stigand quarrelled with William the Conqueror, his lands, including Stockton, were confiscated by the Crown\".\n\nIn 1140 King Stephen granted Stockton, including the manors of [[Ellingham]], [[Geldeston]], [[Gillingham]], [[Kirby Cane]], Winston and Wyndale (Windle), with the right to hold court and set up a gallows, to Hugh [[Bigod]], the newly created Earl of Norfolk. In 1178, Hugh\u2019s son Ralph, the next owner, obtained exclusive fishing rights on the Waveney from Stockton to Shipmeadow, and the right to cut reeds, like those used to thatch the church (it still has a thatched roof today), and to cut rushes for strewing the floors.<ref>[https://tidings-norfolk.org/2020/02/24/stockton-some-historical-notes/ \"Stockton.

The \u201cStockton Town Book\u201d, a manuscript volume containing churchwardens\u2019 accounts for the years 1625-1712, has also been preserved. \n\nAmong the information included in the Town Book that for the [[English Civil War]] (1642-1649) provides a glimpse of a small Norfolk village at the time. Two villagers and the rector went away to fight. Thomas Bande was paid 10 shillings in 1640 \u201cfor being content to be a soldier for the Town\u201d; John Bird, parish clerk, received 15 shillings when \u201cimpressed\u201d for the same purpose in 1643, and his wife was supported by the parish until he returned \u201cmaimed from [[Naseby]] fight\u201d (14 June 1645).

{"title_page": "Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire", "text_new": "{{Short description|Set of revolutions took place in the Austrian Empire from March 1848 to November 1849}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:Praha Barricades 1848.jpg|thumb|300px|Barricades in [[Prague]] during the revolutionary events.]]\n\nA set of revolutions took place in the [[Austrian Empire]] from March 1848 to November 1849. Much of the revolutionary activity had a [[nationalism|nationalist]] character: the Empire, ruled from [[Vienna]], included ethnic [[Germans]], [[Hungarians]], [[Slovenes]], [[Poles]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Ruthenians]] ([[Ukrainians]]), [[Romanians]], [[Croats]], [[Veneto|Venetians]] ([[Italians]]) and [[Serbs]]; all of whom attempted in the course of the revolution to either achieve [[autonomy]], [[independence]], or even [[wikt:hegemony|hegemony]] over other nationalities. The nationalist picture was further complicated by the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|simultaneous events in the German states]], which moved toward greater German national unity.\n\nBesides these [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[liberalism|liberal]] and even [[socialism|socialist]] currents resisted the Empire's longstanding [[conservatism]].\n\n==The early rumblings==\nThe [[revolutions of 1848|events of 1848]] were the product of mounting social and political tensions after the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815.  During the \"pre-March\" period, the already conservative Austrian Empire moved further away from ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], restricted freedom of the press, limited many university activities, and banned fraternities.\n\n===Social and political conflict===\n[[File:Metternich (c. 1835-40).jpg|thumb|Left|[[Metternich]] in the 1840s]]\nConflicts between [[debtor]]s and [[creditor]]s in [[Agriculture in Austria|agricultural]] production as well as over land use rights in parts of Hungary led to conflicts that occasionally erupted into violence. Conflict over organized religion was pervasive in pre-1848 Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Tension came both from within [[Roman Catholicism in Hungary|Catholicism]] and between members of different confessions. These conflicts were often mixed with conflict with the state. Important for the revolutionaries were state conflicts including the armed forces and collection of taxes.<!-- That last sentence is very confusing--> As 1848 approached, the revolutions the Empire crushed to maintain longstanding conservative minister [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]]'s [[Concert of Europe]] left the empire nearly bankrupt and in continual need of soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Draft commissions led to brawls between soldiers and civilians. All of this further agitated the peasantry, who resented their remaining [[feudalism|feudal]] obligations.\n\nDespite lack of freedom of the press and association, there was a flourishing liberal German culture among students and those educated either in Josephine schools{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} or German universities.  They published pamphlets and newspapers discussing education and language; the need for basic liberal reforms was assumed.  These middle class liberals largely understood and accepted that forced labor is not efficient, and that the Empire should adopt a wage labor system. The question was how to institute such reforms.\n\nNotable liberal clubs of the time in Vienna included the [[Legal-Political Reading Club]] (established 1842) and [[Concordia Society]] (1840). They, like the Lower Austrian Manufacturers' Association (1840) were part of a culture that criticized Metternich's government from the city's [[coffeehouse]]s, salons, and even stages, but prior to 1848 their demands had not even extended to [[constitutionalism]] or [[freedom of assembly]], let alone [[republicanism]]. They had merely advocated relaxed censorship, [[freedom of religion]], economic freedoms, and, above all, a more competent administration. They were opposed to outright [[popular sovereignty]] and the [[universal franchise]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|pp=315\u2013316}}</ref>\n\nMore to the [[left-wing politics|left]] was a radicalized, impoverished [[intelligentsia]]. Educational opportunities in 1840s Austria had far outstripped employment opportunities for the educated.<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=316}}</ref>\n\n===Direct cause of the outbreak of violence===\nIn 1846 there had been an uprising of Polish nobility in Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], which was only countered when peasants, in turn, rose up against the nobles.<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|pp=295\u2013296}}</ref> The economic crisis of 1845-47 was marked by recession and food shortages throughout the continent.  At the end of February 1848, demonstrations broke out in Paris. [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe of France]] abdicated the throne, prompting similar revolts throughout the continent.\n\n==Revolution in the Austrian lands==\n\n===An early victory leads to tension===\n[[File:1848 vienna students.jpg|thumb|250px|The Viennese students [[Academic Legion (Vienna)|Academic Legion]] played a key role in toppling Metternich's government and precipitating his retirement on 13 March 1848.]]\nAfter news broke of the February victories in Paris, uprisings occurred throughout Europe, including in [[Vienna]], where the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet (parliament)]] of [[Lower Austria]] in March demanded the resignation of [[Klemens von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the conservative State Chancellor and Foreign Minister. With no forces rallying to Metternich's defense, nor word from [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the contrary, he resigned on 13 March.<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=298}}</ref> Metternich fled to London,<ref>{{harvnb|Schwarzschild|1947|p=174}}: \"Metternich, like Louis Philippe, fled to London\"</ref> and Ferdinand appointed new, nominally liberal, ministers. By November, the Austrian Empire saw several short-lived liberal governments under five successive [[Minister-President of Austria|Ministers-President of Austria]]: [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky|Count Kolowrat]] (17 March\u20134 April), [[Count Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont|Count Ficquelmont]] (4 April\u20133 May), [[Baron Franz von Pillersdorf|Baron Pillersdorf]] (3 May\u20138 July), [[Baron Anton von Doblhoff-Dier|Baron Doblhoff-Dier]] (8 July\u201318 July) and [[Baron Johann von Wessenberg-Ampringen|Baron Wessenberg]] (19 July\u201320 November).<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=314}}</ref>\n\nThe established order collapsed rapidly because of the weakness of the Austrian armies. [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky]] was unable to keep his soldiers fighting [[Republic of San Marco|Venetian]] and [[Five Days of Milan|Milanese insurgents]] in [[Lombardy-Venetia]], and had to, instead, order the remaining troops to evacuate.\n\nSocial and political conflict as well as inter and intra confessional hostility momentarily subsided as much of the continent rejoiced in the liberal victories. Mass political organizations and public participation in government became widespread.\n[[File:Ferdinando I d'Austria.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of the aged Ferdinand dated circa 1870|Photograph of the aged Ferdinand dated circa 1870]]\nHowever, liberal ministers were unable to establish central authority.  Provisional governments in [[Republic of San Marco|Venice]] and [[Milan]] quickly expressed a desire to be part of an Italian confederacy of states; but for the Venetian government this lasted only five days, after the 1848 armistice between Austria and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]]. A new Hungarian government in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] announced its intentions to break away from the Empire and elect Ferdinand its King, and a Polish National Committee announced the same for the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]].\n\n===Social and political tensions after the \"Springtime of Peoples\"===\nThe victory of the party of movement was looked at as an opportunity for lower classes to renew old conflicts with greater anger and energy.  Several tax boycotts and attempted murders of tax collectors occurred in [[Vienna]].  Assaults against soldiers were common, including against Radetzky's troops retreating from [[Milan]].  The archbishop of Vienna was forced to flee, and in Graz, the convent of the Jesuits was destroyed.\n\nThe demands of nationalism and its contradictions became apparent as new national governments began declaring power and unity.  [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]], King of Piedmont-Savoy, initiated a nationalist war on March 23 in the Austrian held northern Italian provinces that would consume the attention of the entire peninsula.  The German nationalist movement faced the question of whether or not Austria should be included in the united German state, a quandary that divided the [[Frankfurt Parliament|Frankfurt National Assembly]]. The liberal ministers in Vienna were willing to allow elections for the German National Assembly in some of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands, but it was undetermined which Habsburg territories would participate. Hungary and Galicia were clearly not German; German nationalists (who dominated the Bohemian Diet<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=310}}</ref>) felt the [[Czech lands|old crown lands]] rightfully belonged to a united German state, despite the fact that the majority of the people of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] spoke [[Czech language|Czech]] \u2014 a [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]]. Czech nationalists viewed the language as far more significant, calling for a boycott of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] elections in Bohemia, Moravia, and neighboring [[Austrian Silesia]] (also partly Czech-speaking). Tensions in [[Prague]] between German and Czech nationalists grew quickly between April and May. After the abolition of serfdom on April 17, [[Supreme Ruthenian Council]] was established in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] to promote the unification of [[Ukrainians|ethnic Ukrainian]] lands of Eastern Galicia, [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathia]] and [[Bukovyna]] in one province. [[Ukrainian language]] department was opened in [[Lviv University]], and the first Ukrainian newspaper ''Zoria Halytska'' started publishing in Lviv on May 15, 1848. On July 1, serfdom was also abolished in Bukovyna.\n\n[[File:Barricade bei der Universit\u00e4t am 26ten Mai 1848 in Wien.jpg|thumb|250px|Vienna in May 1848]]\nBy early summer, conservative regimes had been overthrown, new freedoms (including freedom of the press and freedom of association) had been introduced, and multiple nationalist claims had been exerted.  New parliaments quickly held elections with broad franchise to create constituent assemblies, which would write new constitutions.  The elections that were held produced unexpected results.  The new voters, na\u00efve and confused by their new political power, typically elected conservative or moderately liberal representatives.  The radicals, the ones who supported the broadest franchise, lost under the system they advocated because they were not the locally influential and affluent men. The mixed results led to confrontations similar to the [[June Days Uprising|\"June Days\" uprising]] in Paris. Additionally, these constituent assemblies were charged with the impossible task of managing both the needs of the people of the state and determining what that state physically is at the same time.  The Austrian Constituent Assembly was divided into a Czech faction, a German faction, and a Polish faction, and within each faction was the political left-right spectrum.  Outside the Assembly, petitions, newspapers, mass demonstrations, and political clubs put pressure on their new governments and often expressed violently many of the debates that were occurring within the assembly itself.\n\nThe Czechs held a [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|Pan-Slavic congress]] in [[Prague]] between June 2 and June 12, 1848. It was primarily composed of [[Austroslavism|Austroslavs]] who wanted greater freedom within the Empire, but their status as peasants and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] surrounded by a German middle class doomed their autonomy {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. They also disliked the prospect of annexation of Bohemia to a German Empire.\n\n===Counterrevolution===\n[[Image:Franzjosef.jpg|200px|thumb|A young Emperor Franz Joseph]]\nInsurgents quickly lost in street fighting to King Ferdinand's troops led by [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|General Radetzky]], prompting several liberal government ministers to resign in protest.  Ferdinand, now restored to power in [[Vienna]], appointed conservatives in their places.  These actions were a considerable blow to the revolutionaries, and by August most of northern Italy was under Radetzky's control.\n\nIn [[Bohemia]], the leaders of both the German and Czech nationalist movements were both constitutional monarchists, loyal to the Habsburg Emperor.  Only a few days after the Emperor reconquered northern Italy, [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]] took provocative measures in [[Prague]] to prompt street fighting.  Once the barricades went up, he led Habsburg troops to crush the insurgents.  After having taken back the city, he imposed martial law, ordered the Prague National Committee dissolved, and sent delegates to the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|\"Pan-Slavic\" Congress]] home.  These events were applauded by German nationalists, who failed to understand that the Habsburg military would crush their own national movement as well.\n\nAttention then turned to Hungary. War in Hungary again threatened imperial rule and prompted Emperor Ferdinand and his court to once more flee Vienna.  Viennese radicals welcomed the arrival of Hungarian troops as the only force able to stand up against the court and ministry.  The radicals took control of the city for only a short period of time.  Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz led soldiers from [[Prussia]] to quickly defeat the insurgents.  Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz restored imperial authority to the city.  The reconquering of Vienna was seen as a defeat over German nationalism.  At this point, Ferdinand I named the noble [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]] head of government. Schwarzenberg, a consummate statesman, persuaded the feeble-minded Ferdinand to abdicate the throne to his 18-year-old nephew, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]].  Parliamentarians continued to debate, but had no authority on state policy.\n\nBoth the Czech and Italian revolutions were defeated by the Habsburgs. Prague was the first victory of counter-revolution in the Austrian Empire.\n\n[[Lombardy-Venetia]] was quickly brought back under Austrian rule in the mainland, even because popular support for the revolution vanished: revolutionary ideals were often limited to part of middle and upper classes, which failed both to gain \"hearts and minds\" of lower classes and to convince the population about Italian nationalism. Most part of lower classes indeed were quite indifferent, and actually most part of Lombard and Venetian troops remained loyal.<ref>[http://rassegnastampa.unipi.it/rassegna/archivio/2010/12/08SID3079.PDF The Italians who stayed loyal to the Habsburgs, Gilberto Oneto, 8th December 2010]</ref> The only widespread support to the revolution was in the cities of [[Milan]] and [[Venice]], with [[Republic of San Marco#Return to Austrian control|the Republic of San Marco lasting under siege until 28th of August, 1849]].\n\n==Revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary==\n{{Main|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}\nThe Hungarian Diet was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged in the Diet. The party focused on providing for the peasantry in mostly symbolic ways because of their inability to understand the needs of the laborers. [[Lajos Kossuth]] emerged as the leader of the lower gentry in the Diet.\n\n[[File:Nagysall\u00f3i \u00fctk\u00f6zet Than.jpg|thumb|250px|Hungarian rebels in battle during the Hungarian Revolution]]\nIn 1848, news of the outbreak of revolution in Paris arrived as a new national cabinet took power under Kossuth, and the Diet approved a sweeping reform package, referred to as the \"[[April laws]]\" (also \"March laws\"), that changed almost every aspect of Hungary's economic, social, and political life: (The April laws based on the 12 points:\n\n*Freedom of the Press (The abolition of censure and the censor's offices)\n*Accountable ministries in Buda and Pest (Instead of the simple royal appointment of ministers, all ministers and the government must be elected and dismissed by the parliament)\n*An annual parliamentary session in Pest. (instead of the rare ad-hoc sessions which was convoked by the king) \n*Civil and religious equality before the law. (The abolition of separate laws for the common people and nobility, the abolition of the legal privileges of nobility. Full religious liberty instead of moderated tolerance: the abolition of (Catholic) [[state religion]])\n*National Guard. (The forming of their own Hungarian national guard, it worked like a police force to keep the law and order during the transition of the system, thus preserving the morality of the revolution)\n*Joint share of tax burdens. (abolition of the tax exemption of  the nobility, the abolition of customs and tariff exemption of the nobility)\n*The abolition of socage. (abolition of Feudalism and abolition of the serfdom of peasantry and their bondservices)\n*Juries and representation on an equal basis. (The common people can be elected as juries at the legal courts, all people can be officials even on the highest levels of the public administration and judicature, if they have the prescribed education) \n*National Bank. \n*The army to swear to support the constitution, our soldiers should not be sent to abroad, and foreign soldiers should leave our country.\n*The freeing of political prisoners. \n*Union. (With Transylvania)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marcius15.kormany.hu/a-12-pont-tortenete-2012|title=m\u00e1rcius15|website=marcius15.kormany.hu|access-date=2018-03-16|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917073048/http://marcius15.kormany.hu/a-12-pont-tortenete-2012|archivedate=2017-09-17}}</ref>\n\nThese demands were not easy for the imperial court to accept, however, its weak position provided little choice. One of the first tasks of the Diet was abolishing serfdom, which was announced on March 18, 1848.\n\nThe Hungarian government set limits on the political activity of both the [[Croats|Croatian]] and [[Romanian people|Romanian]] national movements.  Croats and Romanians had their own desires for self-rule and saw no benefit in replacing one central government for another. Armed clashes between the Hungarians and the [[Croats]], [[Romanians]], [[Serbs]], along one border and [[Slovaks]] on the other ensued. In some cases, this was a continuation and an escalation of previous tensions, such as the 1845 [[July victims]] in Croatia.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia]] and the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] severed relations with the new Hungarian government in Pest and devoted itself to the imperial cause. Conservative [[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]], who was appointed the new [[ban (title)|ban]] of Croatia-Slavonia in March by the imperial court, was removed from his position by the constitutional monarchist Hungarian government.  He refused to give up his authority in the name of the monarch.  Thus, there were two governments in Hungary issuing contradictory orders in the name of Ferdinand von Habsburg.<ref>{{harvnb|Sperber|2005|p=143}}</ref>\n[[File:Capitulaton of Hungarian Army at Vil\u00e1gos 1849.png|250px|thumb|right|Capitulation of Hungarian Army at Vil\u00e1gos, 1849]]\n\nAware that they were on the path to civil war in mid-1848, the Hungarian government ministers attempted to gain Habsburg support against Jela\u010di\u0107 by offering to send troops to northern Italy.  Additionally, they attempted to come to terms with Jela\u010di\u0107 himself, but he insisted on the recentralization of Habsburg authority as a pre-condition to any talks.  By the end of August, the imperial government in [[Vienna]] officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest to end plans for a Hungarian army. Jela\u010di\u0107 then took military action against the Hungarian government without any official order.\n\n[[May Assembly|The national assembly of the Serbs in Austrian Empire]] was held between 1 and 3 May 1848 in [[Sremski Karlovci]], during which the Serbs proclaimed autonomous Habsburg crownland of [[Serbian Vojvodina]]. The war started, leading to clashes as such in [[Srbobran]], where on July 14, 1848, the first siege of the town by Hungarian forces began under Baron F\u00fcl\u00f6p Berchtold. The army was forced to retreat due to a strong Serbian defense. With war raging on three fronts (against [[Romanians]] and Serbs in [[Banat]] and Ba\u010dka, and [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]]), Hungarian radicals in Pest saw this as an opportunity.  Parliament made concessions to the radicals in September rather than let the events erupt into violent confrontations.  Shortly thereafter, the final break between Vienna and Pest occurred when Field Marshal [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] was given control of all armies in Hungary (including Jela\u010di\u0107's). In response to Lamberg being attacked on arrival in Hungary a few days later, the imperial court ordered the Hungarian parliament and government dissolved.  Jela\u010di\u0107 was appointed to take Lamberg's place.  War between Austria and Hungary had officially begun.\n\nThe war led to the [[Vienna Rebellion|October Crisis]] in Vienna, when insurgents attacked a garrison on its way to Hungary to support Croatian forces under Jela\u010di\u0107.\n\nAfter Vienna was recaptured by imperial forces, General Windischgr\u00e4tz and 70,000 troops were sent to Hungary to crush the Hungarian revolution and as they advanced the Hungarian government evacuated Pest. However the Austrian army had to retreat after heavy defeats in the Spring Campaign of the Hungarian Army from March to May 1849. Instead of pursuing the Austrian army, the Hungarians stopped to retake the Fort of Buda and prepared defenses. In June 1849 Russian and Austrian troops entered Hungary heavily outnumbering the Hungarian army.

It lasted from September 1848 to November 1849. During this period Slovak patriots established the [[Slovak National Council (1848\u20131849)|Slovak National Council]] as their political representation and military units known as the Slovak Volunteer Corps.  \nThe political, social and national requirements of the Slovak movement were declared in the document entitled \"Demands of the Slovak Nation\" from April 1848.\n\n==The Second Wave of Revolutions==\nRevolutionary movements of 1849 faced an additional challenge: to work together to defeat a common enemy.  Previously, national identity allowed Habsburg forces to conquer revolutionary governments by playing them off one another.  New democratic initiatives in Italy in the spring of 1848{{When|date=September 2009}} led to a renewed conflict with Austrian forces in the provinces of Lombardy and Venetia.  At the very first anniversary of the first barricades in Vienna, German and Czech democrats in Bohemia agreed to put mutual hostilities aside and work together on revolutionary planning.  Hungarians faced the greatest challenge of overcoming the divisions of the previous year, as the fighting there had been the most bitter.  Despite this, the Hungarian government hired a new commander and attempted to unite with Romanian democrat [[Avram Iancu]], who was known as ''Cr\u0103i\u015forul Mun\u0163ilor'' (\"The Prince of the Mountains\").  However, division and mistrust were too severe.\n\nThree days after the start of hostilities in Italy, [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] abdicated the throne of Piedmont-Savoy, essentially ending the Piedmontese return to war.  Renewed military conflicts cost the Empire the little that remained of its finances.  Another challenge to Habsburg authority came from Germany and the question of either \"big Germany\" (united Germany led by Austria) or \"little Germany\" (united Germany led by Prussia).  The Frankfurt National Assembly proposed a constitution with [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia]] as monarch of a united federal Germany composed of only 'German' lands. This would have led to the relationship between Austria and Hungary (as a 'non-German' area) being reduced to a personal union under the Habsburgs, rather than a united state, an unacceptable arrangement for both the Habsburgs and Austro-German liberals in Austria.  In the end, Friedrich Wilhelm refused to accept the constitution written by the Assembly.  Schwarzenberg dissolved the Hungarian Parliament in 1849, imposing his own constitution that conceded nothing to the liberal movement. Appointing [[Alexander Bach]] head of internal affairs, he oversaw the creation of the Bach system, which rooted out political dissent and contained liberals within Austria and quickly returned the status quo. After the deportation of [[Lajos Kossuth]], a nationalist Hungarian leader, Schwarzenberg faced uprisings by Hungarians. Playing on the long-standing Russian tradition of conservativism, he convinced tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] to send Russian forces in. The Russian army quickly destroyed the rebellion, forcing the Hungarians back under Austrian control. In less than three years, Schwarzenberg had returned stability and control to Austria. However, Schwarzenberg had a stroke in 1852, and his successors failed to uphold the control Schwarzenberg had so successfully maintained.\n\n==Peasant Success==\n{{Original research section|date=February 2019}}\nBut were the revolutions a failure? It is a dominant view, if the events are observed through the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] lens of [[nationalism]]. But this [[ideology]] did not become the accepted \u2018normal\u2019 way of founding and legitimizing [[state (polity)|state]]s across Europe until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. In the mid-19th century, over 90 percent of the population in the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[German Confederation]] were [[peasant]]s. Most of them suffered the indignity of [[serfdom]] or some lingering elements of this system of [[unfree labour|forced labor]]. Peasant revolts in 1848-1849 involved more participants than the national revolutions of this period. And most importantly, they were successful bringing the final abolition of serfdom or its remnants across the German Confederation, in the Austrian Empire and [[Prussia]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VltcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=peasants+1848+austria&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6mKGm6OLfAhVJUxUIHQzvBHkQ6wEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=serfdom&f=false The Nation in the Village: The Genesis of Peasant National Identity in ...], By Keely Stauter-Halsted; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5c7iAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=serfdom+prussia+1848&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXvuvb6eLfAhVySRUIHfrPAJ8Q6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&q=1848&f=false Freedom's Price: Serfdom, Subjection, and Reform in Prussia, 1648-1848], By S.

Much of the revolutionary activity had a [[nationalism|nationalist]] character: the Empire, ruled from [[Vienna]], included ethnic [[Germans]], [[Hungarians]], [[Slovenes]], [[Poles]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Ruthenians]] ([[Ukrainians]]), [[Romanians]], [[Croats]], [[Veneto|Venetians]] ([[Italians]]) and [[Serbs]]; all of whom attempted in the course of the revolution to either achieve [[autonomy]], [[independence]], or even [[wikt:hegemony|hegemony]] over other nationalities. The nationalist picture was further complicated by the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|simultaneous events in the German states]], which moved toward greater German national unity.\n\nBesides these [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[liberalism|liberal]] and even [[socialism|socialist]] currents resisted the Empire's longstanding [[conservatism]].\n\n==The early rumblings==\nThe [[revolutions of 1848|events of 1848]] were the product of mounting social and political tensions after the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815.  During the \"pre-March\" period, the already conservative Austrian Empire moved further away from ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], restricted freedom of the press, limited many university activities, and banned fraternities.\n\n===Social and political conflict===\n[[File:Metternich (c. 1835-40).jpg|thumb|Left|[[Metternich]] in the 1840s]]\nConflicts between [[debtor]]s and [[creditor]]s in [[Agriculture in Austria|agricultural]] production as well as over land use rights in parts of Hungary led to conflicts that occasionally erupted into violence. Conflict over organized religion was pervasive in pre-1848 Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Tension came both from within [[Roman Catholicism in Hungary|Catholicism]] and between members of different confessions. These conflicts were often mixed with conflict with the state. Important for the revolutionaries were state conflicts including the armed forces and collection of taxes.<!-- That last sentence is very confusing--> As 1848 approached, the revolutions the Empire crushed to maintain longstanding conservative minister [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]]'s [[Concert of Europe]] left the empire nearly bankrupt and in continual need of soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Draft commissions led to brawls between soldiers and civilians. All of this further agitated the peasantry, who resented their remaining [[feudalism|feudal]] obligations.\n\nDespite lack of freedom of the press and association, there was a flourishing liberal German culture among students and those educated either in Josephine schools{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} or German universities.  They published pamphlets and newspapers discussing education and language; the need for basic liberal reforms was assumed.  These middle class liberals largely understood and accepted that forced labor is not efficient, and that the Empire should adopt a wage labor system. The question was how to institute such reforms.\n\nNotable liberal clubs of the time in Vienna included the [[Legal-Political Reading Club]] (established 1842) and [[Concordia Society]] (1840). They, like the Lower Austrian Manufacturers' Association (1840) were part of a culture that criticized Metternich's government from the city's [[coffeehouse]]s, salons, and even stages, but prior to 1848 their demands had not even extended to [[constitutionalism]] or [[freedom of assembly]], let alone [[republicanism]]. They had merely advocated relaxed censorship, [[freedom of religion]], economic freedoms, and, above all, a more competent administration. They were opposed to outright [[popular sovereignty]] and the [[universal franchise]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|pp=315\u2013316}}</ref>\n\nMore to the [[left-wing politics|left]] was a radicalized, impoverished [[intelligentsia]]. Educational opportunities in 1840s Austria had far outstripped employment opportunities for the educated.<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=316}}</ref>\n\n===Direct cause of the outbreak of violence===\nIn 1846 there had been an uprising of Polish nobility in Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], which was only countered when peasants, in turn, rose up against the nobles.<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|pp=295\u2013296}}</ref> The economic crisis of 1845-47 was marked by recession and food shortages throughout the continent.  At the end of February 1848, demonstrations broke out in Paris. [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe of France]] abdicated the throne, prompting similar revolts throughout the continent.\n\n==Revolution in the Austrian lands==\n\n===An early victory leads to tension===\n[[File:1848 vienna students.jpg|thumb|250px|The Viennese students [[Academic Legion (Vienna)|Academic Legion]] played a key role in toppling Metternich's government and precipitating his retirement on 13 March 1848.]]\nAfter news broke of the February victories in Paris, uprisings occurred throughout Europe, including in [[Vienna]], where the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet (parliament)]] of [[Lower Austria]] in March demanded the resignation of [[Klemens von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the conservative State Chancellor and Foreign Minister. With no forces rallying to Metternich's defense, nor word from [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the contrary, he resigned on 13 March.<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=298}}</ref> Metternich fled to London,<ref>{{harvnb|Schwarzschild|1947|p=174}}: \"Metternich, like Louis Philippe, fled to London\"</ref> and Ferdinand appointed new, nominally liberal, ministers. By November, the Austrian Empire saw several short-lived liberal governments under five successive [[Minister-President of Austria|Ministers-President of Austria]]: [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky|Count Kolowrat]] (17 March\u20134 April), [[Count Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont|Count Ficquelmont]] (4 April\u20133 May), [[Baron Franz von Pillersdorf|Baron Pillersdorf]] (3 May\u20138 July), [[Baron Anton von Doblhoff-Dier|Baron Doblhoff-Dier]] (8 July\u201318 July) and [[Baron Johann von Wessenberg-Ampringen|Baron Wessenberg]] (19 July\u201320 November).<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=314}}</ref>\n\nThe established order collapsed rapidly because of the weakness of the Austrian armies. [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky]] was unable to keep his soldiers fighting [[Republic of San Marco|Venetian]] and [[Five Days of Milan|Milanese insurgents]] in [[Lombardy-Venetia]], and had to, instead, order the remaining troops to evacuate.\n\nSocial and political conflict as well as inter and intra confessional hostility momentarily subsided as much of the continent rejoiced in the liberal victories. Mass political organizations and public participation in government became widespread.\n[[File:Ferdinando I d'Austria.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of the aged Ferdinand dated circa 1870|Photograph of the aged Ferdinand dated circa 1870]]\nHowever, liberal ministers were unable to establish central authority.  Provisional governments in [[Republic of San Marco|Venice]] and [[Milan]] quickly expressed a desire to be part of an Italian confederacy of states; but for the Venetian government this lasted only five days, after the 1848 armistice between Austria and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]]. A new Hungarian government in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] announced its intentions to break away from the Empire and elect Ferdinand its King, and a Polish National Committee announced the same for the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]].\n\n===Social and political tensions after the \"Springtime of Peoples\"===\nThe victory of the party of movement was looked at as an opportunity for lower classes to renew old conflicts with greater anger and energy.  Several tax boycotts and attempted murders of tax collectors occurred in [[Vienna]].  Assaults against soldiers were common, including against Radetzky's troops retreating from [[Milan]].  The archbishop of Vienna was forced to flee, and in Graz, the convent of the Jesuits was destroyed.\n\nThe demands of nationalism and its contradictions became apparent as new national governments began declaring power and unity.  [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]], King of Piedmont-Savoy, initiated a nationalist war on March 23 in the Austrian held northern Italian provinces that would consume the attention of the entire peninsula.  The German nationalist movement faced the question of whether or not Austria should be included in the united German state, a quandary that divided the [[Frankfurt Parliament|Frankfurt National Assembly]]. The liberal ministers in Vienna were willing to allow elections for the German National Assembly in some of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands, but it was undetermined which Habsburg territories would participate. Hungary and Galicia were clearly not German; German nationalists (who dominated the Bohemian Diet<ref>{{harvnb|Bidelux|Jeffries|1998|p=310}}</ref>) felt the [[Czech lands|old crown lands]] rightfully belonged to a united German state, despite the fact that the majority of the people of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] spoke [[Czech language|Czech]] \u2014 a [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]]. Czech nationalists viewed the language as far more significant, calling for a boycott of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] elections in Bohemia, Moravia, and neighboring [[Austrian Silesia]] (also partly Czech-speaking). Tensions in [[Prague]] between German and Czech nationalists grew quickly between April and May. After the abolition of serfdom on April 17, [[Supreme Ruthenian Council]] was established in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] to promote the unification of [[Ukrainians|ethnic Ukrainian]] lands of Eastern Galicia, [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathia]] and [[Bukovyna]] in one province. [[Ukrainian language]] department was opened in [[Lviv University]], and the first Ukrainian newspaper ''Zoria Halytska'' started publishing in Lviv on May 15, 1848. On July 1, serfdom was also abolished in Bukovyna.\n\n[[File:Barricade bei der Universit\u00e4t am 26ten Mai 1848 in Wien.jpg|thumb|250px|Vienna in May 1848]]\nBy early summer, conservative regimes had been overthrown, new freedoms (including freedom of the press and freedom of association) had been introduced, and multiple nationalist claims had been exerted.  New parliaments quickly held elections with broad franchise to create constituent assemblies, which would write new constitutions.  The elections that were held produced unexpected results.  The new voters, na\u00efve and confused by their new political power, typically elected conservative or moderately liberal representatives.  The radicals, the ones who supported the broadest franchise, lost under the system they advocated because they were not the locally influential and affluent men. The mixed results led to confrontations similar to the [[June Days Uprising|\"June Days\" uprising]] in Paris. Additionally, these constituent assemblies were charged with the impossible task of managing both the needs of the people of the state and determining what that state physically is at the same time.  The Austrian Constituent Assembly was divided into a Czech faction, a German faction, and a Polish faction, and within each faction was the political left-right spectrum.  Outside the Assembly, petitions, newspapers, mass demonstrations, and political clubs put pressure on their new governments and often expressed violently many of the debates that were occurring within the assembly itself.\n\nThe Czechs held a [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|Pan-Slavic congress]] in [[Prague]] between June 2 and June 12, 1848. It was primarily composed of [[Austroslavism|Austroslavs]] who wanted greater freedom within the Empire, but their status as peasants and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] surrounded by a German middle class doomed their autonomy {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. They also disliked the prospect of annexation of Bohemia to a German Empire.\n\n===Counterrevolution===\n[[Image:Franzjosef.jpg|200px|thumb|A young Emperor Franz Joseph]]\nInsurgents quickly lost in street fighting to King Ferdinand's troops led by [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|General Radetzky]], prompting several liberal government ministers to resign in protest.  Ferdinand, now restored to power in [[Vienna]], appointed conservatives in their places.  These actions were a considerable blow to the revolutionaries, and by August most of northern Italy was under Radetzky's control.\n\nIn [[Bohemia]], the leaders of both the German and Czech nationalist movements were both constitutional monarchists, loyal to the Habsburg Emperor.  Only a few days after the Emperor reconquered northern Italy, [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]] took provocative measures in [[Prague]] to prompt street fighting.  Once the barricades went up, he led Habsburg troops to crush the insurgents.  After having taken back the city, he imposed martial law, ordered the Prague National Committee dissolved, and sent delegates to the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|\"Pan-Slavic\" Congress]] home.  These events were applauded by German nationalists, who failed to understand that the Habsburg military would crush their own national movement as well.\n\nAttention then turned to Hungary. War in Hungary again threatened imperial rule and prompted Emperor Ferdinand and his court to once more flee Vienna.  Viennese radicals welcomed the arrival of Hungarian troops as the only force able to stand up against the court and ministry.  The radicals took control of the city for only a short period of time.  Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz led soldiers from [[Prussia]] to quickly defeat the insurgents.  Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz restored imperial authority to the city.  The reconquering of Vienna was seen as a defeat over German nationalism.  At this point, Ferdinand I named the noble [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]] head of government. Schwarzenberg, a consummate statesman, persuaded the feeble-minded Ferdinand to abdicate the throne to his 18-year-old nephew, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]].  Parliamentarians continued to debate, but had no authority on state policy.\n\nBoth the Czech and Italian revolutions were defeated by the Habsburgs. Prague was the first victory of counter-revolution in the Austrian Empire.\n\n[[Lombardy-Venetia]] was quickly brought back under Austrian rule in the mainland, even because popular support for the revolution vanished: revolutionary ideals were often limited to part of middle and upper classes, which failed both to gain \"hearts and minds\" of lower classes and to convince the population about Italian nationalism. Most part of lower classes indeed were quite indifferent, and actually most part of Lombard and Venetian troops remained loyal.<ref>[http://rassegnastampa.unipi.it/rassegna/archivio/2010/12/08SID3079.PDF The Italians who stayed loyal to the Habsburgs, Gilberto Oneto, 8th December 2010]</ref> The only widespread support to the revolution was in the cities of [[Milan]] and [[Venice]], with [[Republic of San Marco#Return to Austrian control|the Republic of San Marco lasting under siege until 28th of August, 1849]].\n\n==Revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary==\n{{Main|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}\nThe Hungarian Diet was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged in the Diet. The party focused on providing for the peasantry in mostly symbolic ways because of their inability to understand the needs of the laborers. [[Lajos Kossuth]] emerged as the leader of the lower gentry in the Diet.\n\n[[File:Nagysall\u00f3i \u00fctk\u00f6zet Than.jpg|thumb|250px|Hungarian rebels in battle during the Hungarian Revolution]]\nIn 1848, news of the outbreak of revolution in Paris arrived as a new national cabinet took power under Kossuth, and the Diet approved a sweeping reform package, referred to as the \"[[April laws]]\" (also \"March laws\"), that changed almost every aspect of Hungary's economic, social, and political life: (The April laws based on the 12 points:\n\n*Freedom of the Press (The abolition of censure and the censor's offices)\n*Accountable ministries in Buda and Pest (Instead of the simple royal appointment of ministers, all ministers and the government must be elected and dismissed by the parliament)\n*An annual parliamentary session in Pest.

One of the first tasks of the Diet was abolishing serfdom, which was announced on March 18, 1848.\n\nThe Hungarian government set limits on the political activity of both the [[Croats|Croatian]] and [[Romanian people|Romanian]] national movements.  Croats and Romanians had their own desires for self-rule and saw no benefit in replacing one central government for another. Armed clashes between the Hungarians and the [[Croats]], [[Romanians]], [[Serbs]], along one border and [[Slovaks]] on the other ensued. In some cases, this was a continuation and an escalation of previous tensions, such as the 1845 [[July victims]] in Croatia.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia]] and the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] severed relations with the new Hungarian government in Pest and devoted itself to the imperial cause. Conservative [[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]], who was appointed the new [[ban (title)|ban]] of Croatia-Slavonia in March by the imperial court, was removed from his position by the constitutional monarchist Hungarian government.  He refused to give up his authority in the name of the monarch.  Thus, there were two governments in Hungary issuing contradictory orders in the name of Ferdinand von Habsburg.<ref>{{harvnb|Sperber|2005|p=143}}</ref>\n[[File:Capitulaton of Hungarian Army at Vil\u00e1gos 1849.png|250px|thumb|right|Capitulation of Hungarian Army at Vil\u00e1gos, 1849]]\n\nAware that they were on the path to civil war in mid-1848, the Hungarian government ministers attempted to gain Habsburg support against Jela\u010di\u0107 by offering to send troops to northern Italy.  Additionally, they attempted to come to terms with Jela\u010di\u0107 himself, but he insisted on the recentralization of Habsburg authority as a pre-condition to any talks.  By the end of August, the imperial government in [[Vienna]] officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest to end plans for a Hungarian army. Jela\u010di\u0107 then took military action against the Hungarian government without any official order.\n\n[[May Assembly|The national assembly of the Serbs in Austrian Empire]] was held between 1 and 3 May 1848 in [[Sremski Karlovci]], during which the Serbs proclaimed autonomous Habsburg crownland of [[Serbian Vojvodina]]. The war started, leading to clashes as such in [[Srbobran]], where on July 14, 1848, the first siege of the town by Hungarian forces began under Baron F\u00fcl\u00f6p Berchtold. The army was forced to retreat due to a strong Serbian defense. With war raging on three fronts (against [[Romanians]] and Serbs in [[Banat]] and Ba\u010dka, and [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]]), Hungarian radicals in Pest saw this as an opportunity.  Parliament made concessions to the radicals in September rather than let the events erupt into violent confrontations.  Shortly thereafter, the final break between Vienna and Pest occurred when Field Marshal [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] was given control of all armies in Hungary (including Jela\u010di\u0107's). In response to Lamberg being attacked on arrival in Hungary a few days later, the imperial court ordered the Hungarian parliament and government dissolved.  Jela\u010di\u0107 was appointed to take Lamberg's place.  War between Austria and Hungary had officially begun.\n\nThe war led to the [[Vienna Rebellion|October Crisis]] in Vienna, when insurgents attacked a garrison on its way to Hungary to support Croatian forces under Jela\u010di\u0107.\n\nAfter Vienna was recaptured by imperial forces, General Windischgr\u00e4tz and 70,000 troops were sent to Hungary to crush the Hungarian revolution and as they advanced the Hungarian government evacuated Pest. However the Austrian army had to retreat after heavy defeats in the Spring Campaign of the Hungarian Army from March to May 1849. Instead of pursuing the Austrian army, the Hungarians stopped to retake the Fort of Buda and prepared defenses. In June 1849 Russian and Austrian troops entered Hungary heavily outnumbering the Hungarian army. Kossuth abdicated on August 11, 1849 in favour of [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], who he thought was the only general who was capable of saving the nation. \nHowever, in May 1849, Czar Nicholas I pledged to redouble his efforts against the Hungarian Government. He and Emperor Franz Joseph started to regather and rearm an army to be commanded by [[Anton Vogl]], the Austrian lieutenant-field-marshal.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=618}} The Czar was also preparing to send 30,000 Russian soldiers back over the Eastern Carpathian Mountains from Poland.\n\nOn August 13,  after several bitter defeats in a hopeless situation G\u00f6rgey, signed a [[surrender at Vil\u00e1gos]] (now [[\u015eiria, Romania]]) to the Russians, who handed the army over to the Austrians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3822491.html|title=Hungary's War of Independence|first=J\u00e1nos B.|last=Szab\u00f3|work=historynet.com|date=5 September 2006|accessdate=2 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401053017/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3822491.html|archive-date=1 April 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Western Slovak Uprising===\n{{Main|Slovak Uprising 1848-1849}}\n[[File:Rozpustenie slovensk\u00fdch dobrovo\u013en\u00edkov.jpg|300px|thumb|Slovak Volunteer Corps.]]\nSlovak Uprising was an uprising of [[Slovaks]] against [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] (i.e. ethnic Hungarian) domination in the Western parts<ref>{{cite book|authors=[[Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Teich]], Du\u0161an Kov\u00e1\u010d, Martin D.

It lasted from September 1848 to November 1849. During this period Slovak patriots established the [[Slovak National Council (1848\u20131849)|Slovak National Council]] as their political representation and military units known as the Slovak Volunteer Corps.  \nThe political, social and national requirements of the Slovak movement were declared in the document entitled \"Demands of the Slovak Nation\" from April 1848.\n\n==The Second Wave of Revolutions==\nRevolutionary movements of 1849 faced an additional challenge: to work together to defeat a common enemy.  Previously, national identity allowed Habsburg forces to conquer revolutionary governments by playing them off one another.  New democratic initiatives in Italy in the spring of 1848{{When|date=September 2009}} led to a renewed conflict with Austrian forces in the provinces of Lombardy and Venetia.  At the very first anniversary of the first barricades in Vienna, German and Czech democrats in Bohemia agreed to put mutual hostilities aside and work together on revolutionary planning.  Hungarians faced the greatest challenge of overcoming the divisions of the previous year, as the fighting there had been the most bitter.  Despite this, the Hungarian government hired a new commander and attempted to unite with Romanian democrat [[Avram Iancu]], who was known as ''Cr\u0103i\u015forul Mun\u0163ilor'' (\"The Prince of the Mountains\").  However, division and mistrust were too severe.\n\nThree days after the start of hostilities in Italy, [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] abdicated the throne of Piedmont-Savoy, essentially ending the Piedmontese return to war.  Renewed military conflicts cost the Empire the little that remained of its finances.  Another challenge to Habsburg authority came from Germany and the question of either \"big Germany\" (united Germany led by Austria) or \"little Germany\" (united Germany led by Prussia).  The Frankfurt National Assembly proposed a constitution with [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia]] as monarch of a united federal Germany composed of only 'German' lands. This would have led to the relationship between Austria and Hungary (as a 'non-German' area) being reduced to a personal union under the Habsburgs, rather than a united state, an unacceptable arrangement for both the Habsburgs and Austro-German liberals in Austria.  In the end, Friedrich Wilhelm refused to accept the constitution written by the Assembly.  Schwarzenberg dissolved the Hungarian Parliament in 1849, imposing his own constitution that conceded nothing to the liberal movement. Appointing [[Alexander Bach]] head of internal affairs, he oversaw the creation of the Bach system, which rooted out political dissent and contained liberals within Austria and quickly returned the status quo. After the deportation of [[Lajos Kossuth]], a nationalist Hungarian leader, Schwarzenberg faced uprisings by Hungarians. Playing on the long-standing Russian tradition of conservativism, he convinced tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] to send Russian forces in. The Russian army quickly destroyed the rebellion, forcing the Hungarians back under Austrian control. In less than three years, Schwarzenberg had returned stability and control to Austria. However, Schwarzenberg had a stroke in 1852, and his successors failed to uphold the control Schwarzenberg had so successfully maintained.\n\n==Peasant Success==\n{{Original research section|date=February 2019}}\nBut were the revolutions a failure? It is a dominant view, if the events are observed through the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] lens of [[nationalism]]. But this [[ideology]] did not become the accepted \u2018normal\u2019 way of founding and legitimizing [[state (polity)|state]]s across Europe until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. In the mid-19th century, over 90 percent of the population in the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[German Confederation]] were [[peasant]]s. Most of them suffered the indignity of [[serfdom]] or some lingering elements of this system of [[unfree labour|forced labor]]. Peasant revolts in 1848-1849 involved more participants than the national revolutions of this period. And most importantly, they were successful bringing the final abolition of serfdom or its remnants across the German Confederation, in the Austrian Empire and [[Prussia]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VltcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=peasants+1848+austria&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6mKGm6OLfAhVJUxUIHQzvBHkQ6wEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=serfdom&f=false The Nation in the Village: The Genesis of Peasant National Identity in ...], By Keely Stauter-Halsted; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5c7iAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=serfdom+prussia+1848&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXvuvb6eLfAhVySRUIHfrPAJ8Q6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&q=1848&f=false Freedom's Price: Serfdom, Subjection, and Reform in Prussia, 1648-1848], By S.

Its main attraction was [[Punk rock|punk music]]. The name comes from the fact the building it was in originally began as a [[deaf people]]'s [[Community centre|clubhouse]] in the 1930s.\n\n==Founding==\nDaphne (dead name \"Robert\") Hanrahan, manager of [[The Offs]] discovered the San Francisco Club for the Deaf, and was able to rent it on a nightly basis. <!-- It was in a [[loft]]-like space at the top of two long flights of stairs. -->\n\nShe remembers finding the place: \u201cI bought a burrito at La Cumbre and noticed a sign on the fire escape across the street. It said \u2018Hall for Rent.\u2019 I went up the flights of stairs and saw two guys watching TV with the sound off. After a very short while, I realized we weren't going to communicate, so I wrote on a piece of paper that I wanted to rent the place. Bill\u2014I never knew his last name\u2014was a mustachioed, lascivious, cigar-chewing character who apparently was in charge. He wrote \u2018OK & $250,\u2019 so I wrote \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d<ref name=\"ROOTS\">THE ROOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO PUNK: THE DEAF CLUB, 1978-1980</ref>\n\nThe first show as the Deaf Club on 9 December 1978 featured the Offs, started by guitarist Billy Hawk and singer Don Vinil, and later joined by former Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler and a rotation of horn players including Bob Roberts, Richard Edson and Roland Young. They were accompanied by [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]], who are known for their theatrical performances which often include elaborate props, projections, and comical antics. They are credited with being one of the first \"Art-punk\" bands in San Francisco, and were one of the most popular bands of the San Francisco punk scene during the late 1970s and early 1980s. On The Rag also participated in the Deaf Club's first show. Over 100 bands such as [[Northern California]]'s  [[The Dead Kennedys]], [[Tuxedomoon]], [[The Units]], [[The Zeros (American band)|The Zeros]], [[Crime (band)|Crime]], [[The Dils]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Southern California]]'s [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], [[The Alley Cats (punk rock band)|The Alley Cats]], [[Germs (band)|Germs]], [[X (American band)|X]], [[Noh Mercy]], [[Negative Trend]], [[JJ180]], [[Snuky]], [[Walking Dead (band)|Walking Dead]] and [[Dinettes]] would play this small underground club.\n\nGiven the unique nature of the venue and its location in the [[Mission District]] near 16th Street and the [[Roxie Theater]], it was enthusiastically supported by the punk and arts community, visited by film greats like [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] and occasionally challenged by the officials of the San Francisco noise abatement patrol, the police, fire department, health department and the alcohol and beverage control until it closed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nThe house [[Disc jockey|DJs]] were Enrico Chandoha who worked on the editorial staff of the early [[Thrasher Magazine]]; Jack Fan (an Offs road manager and chef at the Zuni); [[BBC]] celebrity [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]]; and Robert Hanrahan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nAbout such venues, Brendan Earley of [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]] comments:\n\n<blockquote>\"The earthiness, I guess, of playing places like the Deaf Club seemed to have a lot more energy to them. You know the crowd that started coming to this music in '77, it was maybe a peak of their scene, or the scene at that time. They were not normal kinds of clubs, they weren't places like the Stone, or even the Mabuhay, really. They were neat places to play; often good audiences, and good energy going on.\"<ref>Quote cited from [[White Noise Records]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n\u2033A possibly unique aspect of the club was the constant presence of actual deaf people in the hall, who didn't know what to make of their unruly musical cohorts\u2014but counterintuitively, they did seem to enjoy the music. Indeed, punk music might be tailor-made for deaf people to enjoy, because of the constant frenetic thudding of the 4/4 beat that can be sensed as vibrations. As Penelope Houston of The Avengers said, \u201cIt was kind of amazing. I think they were dancing to the vibrations. The deaf people were amused that all these punks wanted to come in and rent their room and have these shows.\u201d According to artist Winston Smith, \u201cThey put their hands on the table and they could hear the music. It was music they could appreciate because it was so loud.\u201d\u2033<ref name=\"ROOTS\" />\n\nIn an interview Robert Hanrahan says \"The social aspect of being able to participate and be accepted was big for the deaf people. They enjoyed being exposed to a different subculture like their own. It was very convivial, no fights or hassles.<ref>Deaf Club\n\"I was there...\"\nBy Daphne Hanrahan</ref>\n\n==Walking Dead Records compilation albums==\nThe four partners in [[Walking Dead Records]] developed a live compilation project that resulted in an [[Compilation album|album]] released by Optional Record distribution of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, CA]] on the Walking Dead label: \"Can You Hear Me? Music From the Deaf Club.\" It was recorded on a mobile 8 track by Jim Keylor (also of Army Street Studios), DJ'ed by Johnnie Walker [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/walker/], produced by Robert Hanrahan who also managed and booked the Club, and coordinated by Peter Worrall. The photos selected for the album were taken by Sue Brisk, the [[album art]] was by Diana Miami (aka Diana Stumbo) and the [[liner notes]] were written by V. Vale of [[RE/Search]]/Search & Destroy. It was recorded live at the club during early 1979 and is a testament to the authentic underground punk and \"[[New wave music|new wave]]\" scene during that period in San Francisco's music history. The album featured [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]]' \"Tribute to Russ Meyer\" and \"Monster of Love\" and performances from other first and second generation San Francisco Punk bands like:\n* Offs \u2013 \"Hundred Dollar Limo\", \"Die Babylon\", \"I've Got the Handle\" (Offs were: Don Vinyl, Billy Hawk, Bob Roberts now of Spotlight Tattoo in Los Angeles, Bob Steeler and Denny Boredom who also played with Hot Tuna)\n* Pink Section \u2013 \"Jane Blank\", Francine's List\" & \"Been In The Basement 30 Years\" (Pink Section was: singer Judy Gittelsohn and drummer Carol Detweiler (both members of Inflatable Boy Clams), singer / guitarist Matt Heckert (Survival Research Laboratories), and bassist Stephen Wymore.)\n* Tuxedomoon \u2013 \"19th Nervous Breakdown\", courtesy of [[The Rolling Stones]] and \"Heaven\" from the film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (Tuxedomoon was: Winston Tong, Steven Brown, Blane Reinenger, Peter Carcinogenic (Principle), Greg Langston on drums, With Bruce Geduldig on visuals)\n* KGB \u2013 \"Dying in the USA\" & \"Picture Frame Seduction\"\n* [[Dead Kennedys]] with \"Police Truck\", \"California Uber Alles\", \"Short Songs\" & \"Straight A's\". [[East Bay Ray|Raymond Pepperell, Jr., better known as East Bay Ray]] of the Dead Kennedys used the original two track safety masters from that live eight track recording to release their recent 2004 ''[[Live at the Deaf Club]]'' CD.\n\nFrom the Deaf Club, Walking Dead also produced, with William Passerelli, Dirk Dirksen ([[Mabuhay Gardens]]), Paul Rat Bachavich (Temple Beautiful) & Goody Thompson: the Western Front Festival. The festival engaged the Deaf Club and every venue, (including the \"art clubs\": A.R.E., [[Target Video]], [[Valencia Tool & Die]], Club Foot, the A-hole and Club Generic) in the San Francisco Bay Area that embraced [[punk culture]] and music for a week long event.\n\n==Reviews==\nIn a conversation with Robert Hanrahan at the Deaf Club during a show during the Western Front with one of the Dinettes of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]],[[Joel Selvin]] the [[music critic]] for the [[San Francisco Chronicle|SF Chronicle]] who was attracted by the energy surrounding the punk scene promised to \"put the scene on the map.\"{{Cite quote|date=May 2010}}  Selvin authored an extensive article published in the San Francisco Chronicle, October 22, 1979 on page 6 entitled \"S.F. Goes Punk.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It documented the scene during that time and included interviews with Dirk Dirksen, Joe Rees, Robert Hanrahan, Johnnie Walker and Paul Rat Bachavich. He also mentioned the Deaf Club in a subsequent publication: \"San Francisco: The Musical History Tour : A Guide to over 200 of the Bay Area's Most Memorable Music Sites\" where he disparages the Club as \"one of the stranger scenes on the punk rock scene.\"\n\nTono Rondone, a member of the Frank Hymng Band, which featured Fritz Fox of [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]], remembers a humorous sideline to the history of The Deaf Club: \"At one point, there was a headline in the San Francisco Chronicle which told of the temporary closing of The Deaf Club whose headline read 'Deaf Club Closed Due to Excessive Noise Levels.'\"{{Cite quote|date=May 2010}}\n\nHerb Caen in his daily ''San Francisco Chronicle'' column dated Monday August 13, 1979 \"Have a Weird Day\" said: \"I don't know about you, but I find it slightly bizarre that The Deaf Club at 530 Valencia \u2013 indeed a social hangout for deaf people \u2013 features punk rock groups, such as Zen, Off, The Pink Section, Blow Driers and Mutants. \"The louder the better!\" beams Edward Juaregui, executive director of Deaf Self Help. \"We all like to dance, and we can feel the vibrations.\" How about the neighbors? \"Oh,\" continued Edward, \"they're going crazy. They keep calling the cops, complaining the noise is deafening. Isn't that rich?\"\n\nEthan Davison a fan said \"The most interesting thing about the Deaf Club was that it was a real Deaf Club. The members stood around with the rest of us drinking the pow- erful drinks. I don't sign, so I never \u201cspoke\u201d to any of them, but what I was told was that they enjoyed our music because they could feel the vibrations on the floor. I imagine that they also enjoyed the visual display, for we were the most visually interesting visual community at the time. People would dye their hair a different shade of blue, green, or purple every week. It can now be said that I never had trouble buying a Bloody Mary, even though I was sixteen.\"<ref name=\"un-oral\">the deaf club an un-oral history</ref>\n\nKathy Peck, of the Contractions, remembers the Deaf Club fondly, explaining that, \"The place was filthy. My boots would stick to the floor. The deaf people would dance to the vibration of the beat. Robert Hanrahan would do a radio show with Johnny Walker (BBC punk rock DJ) on the side of the stage, it seems. Robert Hanrahan, manager of the Offs discovered the San Francisco Club for the Deaf in 1978, and was able to rent it on a nightly basis. It was great fun. The Deaf Club was more a like a neighborhood place, very underground, in the Mission District. People would give the deaf sign for a beer as the Offs, the Contractions, Middle Class, No Alternative, and the Dils played. People like Ginger Coyote (Punk Globe) would hang out, dance, and drink. The bathroom was full of graffiti. We'd load in, and the punk bands would always get in crazy fights, especially Brittley Black, drummer of Crime, who fell out of the upstairs window many a night.The deaf people were receptive. They could \u201chear\u201d throughthe wooden floor\u2014a simple floor, made from planks or linoleum. It could catch the vibrations. FrankMoore from the Outrageous Beauty Pageant was there in his wheelchair that people dragged upstairs, since it was on the second floor. Dirk Dirksen (Mabuhay club promoter and San Francisco music icon) nurtured his career.<ref name=\"un-oral\" />\n\nAs Bonnie Hayes from the Punts says, \u201cThe club was utterly un-controlled, which was one of the best things about it. It was basically like a big, really messy party at someone's house. It seemed private, like an inside thing --- you would meet everybody and be in the family.\u201d\n\nIn his daily San Francisco Chronicle column dated Monday August 13, 1979, \"Have a Weird Day\",  Herb Caen said:    \n\"I don't know about you, but I find it slightly bizarre that The Deaf Club at 530 Valencia \u2013 indeed a social hangout for deaf people \u2013 features punk rock groups, such as Zen, Off, The Pink Section, Blow Driers and Mutants. \"The louder the better!\" beams Edward Juaregui, executive director of Deaf Self Help. \"We all like to dance, and we can feel the vibrations.\" How about the neighbors? \"Oh,\" continued Edward, \"they're going crazy. They keep calling the cops, complaining the noise is deafening. Isn't that rich?\"\n\nIn a conversation with [[Klaus Flouride]] of The Dead Kennedys he looks back at the state of the Deaf club.\"I remember it being working-class, but I don't remember it being that dingy, but we played an awful lot of pretty dingy punk clubs. That didn't ever impress upon me that much. I think that \u201cCalifornia \u00dcber Alles\u201d might have come out by the time we played there, but I really don't think so, because we still had 6025 in the group. So, it was still before we had a single out. We were still early on in the thing. There was a folding table in the back. They sold cans of Budweiser. I think it was for like a buck apiece. Back then, you could get Buds for $2.50 or $3.00 a six-pack, or something like that, so they were doing okay. That was your bar. The thing that impressed me the most was that when we were watching the Germs I was right up front, and I was trying to talk to the person next to me. Everybody was grabbing somebody's ear and hollering to try and talk, whereas the deaf members, the people who were deaf and frequented the place on an everyday basis, would just lean forward towards the stage and sign each other\u2014 no problem with communication.\"<ref>the deaf club an un oral history</ref>\n\nEsmerelda Kent of Noh Mercy recalls that, \"The Deaf Club was down the street from our \u201chouse\u201d which was a ginormous storefront, 1920s dry goods store on Valencia Street that is now Artists Television Access (ATA Gallery) at 992 Valencia St., where me, Tony Hotel, and our manager (and Tuxedomoon's manager) Adrian Craig lived. We had a huge basement that had secret passages (connecting all the block) where we used to record and practice.\nThe Deaf Club was my favorite club because of how strange it was. One night after we played at the end of the night, I went backstage and changed and I thought everyone had left because it was so quiet I was sure I was alone. I went out and the room was full with over a hundred people all signing. I wondered if drunk deaf people slurred their sign language.They loved the music because they could feel it. Deafness knows no specific demographic, so rich, poor, old, young, black, Asian, anyone could be and often was deaf and they were all there. Who knew? It was great to write a note of what you wanted to the bartender and see old ladies drinking with spiked mohawk punks.\"\n\n==Closing==\nThe club closed with a party hosted by the artist and filmmaker [[Bruce Conner]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\nThe club had a history of being closed for various reasons, such as by the fire marshal for the lack of sprinklers. Holding private parties with a closed door policy was a way of it continuing to run. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The DEAF CLUB closed after the WESTERN FRONT, a September-October festival of West Coast Bands, which went underreported.

Its main attraction was [[Punk rock|punk music]]. The name comes from the fact the building it was in originally began as a [[deaf people]]'s [[Community centre|clubhouse]] in the 1930s.\n\n==Founding==\nDaphne (dead name \"Robert\") Hanrahan, manager of [[The Offs]] discovered the San Francisco Club for the Deaf, and was able to rent it on a nightly basis. <!-- It was in a [[loft]]-like space at the top of two long flights of stairs. -->\n\nShe remembers finding the place: \u201cI bought a burrito at La Cumbre and noticed a sign on the fire escape across the street. It said \u2018Hall for Rent.\u2019 I went up the flights of stairs and saw two guys watching TV with the sound off. After a very short while, I realized we weren\u2019t going to communicate, so I wrote on a piece of paper that I wanted to rent the place. Bill\u2014I never knew his last name\u2014was a mustachioed, lascivious, cigar-chewing character who apparently was in charge. He wrote \u2018OK & $250,\u2019 so I wrote \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d<ref>THE ROOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO PUNK: THE DEAF CLUB, 1978-1980</ref>\n\nThe first show as the Deaf Club on 9 December 1978 featured the Offs, started by guitarist Billy Hawk and singer Don Vinil, and later joined by former Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler and a rotation of horn players including Bob Roberts, Richard Edson and Roland Young. They were accompanied by [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants], who are known for their theatrical performances which often include elaborate props, projections, and comical antics. They are credited with being one of the first \"Art-punk\" bands in San Francisco, and were one of the most popular bands of the San Francisco punk scene during the late 1970s and early 1980s. On The Rag also participated in the Deaf Club's first show. Over 100 bands such as [[Northern California]]'s  [[The Dead Kennedys]], [[Tuxedomoon]], [[The Units]], [[The Zeros (American band)|The Zeros]], [[Crime (band)|Crime]], [[The Dils]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Southern California]]'s [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], [[The Alley Cats (punk rock band)|The Alley Cats]], [[Germs (band)|Germs]], [[X (American band)|X]], [[Noh Mercy]], [[Negative Trend]], [[JJ180]], [[Snuky]], [[Walking Dead]] and [[Dinettes]] would play this small underground club.\n\nGiven the unique nature of the venue and its location in the [[Mission District]] near 16th Street and the [[Roxie Theater]], it was enthusiastically supported by the punk and arts community, visited by film greats like [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] and occasionally challenged by the officials of the San Francisco noise abatement patrol, the police, fire department, health department and the alcohol and beverage control until it closed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nThe house [[Disc jockey|DJs]] were Enrico Chandoha who worked on the editorial staff of the early [[Thrasher Magazine]]; Jack Fan (an Offs road manager and chef at the Zuni); [[BBC]] celebrity [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]]; and Robert Hanrahan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nAbout such venues, Brendan Earley of [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]] comments:\n\n<blockquote>\"The earthiness, I guess, of playing places like the Deaf Club seemed to have a lot more energy to them. You know the crowd that started coming to this music in '77, it was maybe a peak of their scene, or the scene at that time. They were not normal kinds of clubs, they weren't places like the Stone, or even the Mabuhay, really. They were neat places to play; often good audiences, and good energy going on.\"<ref>Quote cited from [[White Noise Records]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n\u2033A possibly unique aspect of the club was the constant presence of actual deaf people in the hall, who didn\u2019t know what to make of their unruly musical cohorts\u2014but counterintuitively, they did seem to enjoy the music. Indeed, punk music might be tailor-made for deaf people to enjoy, because of the constant frenetic thudding of the 4/4 beat that can be sensed as vibrations. As Penelope Houston of The Avengers said, \u201cIt was kind of amazing. I think they were dancing to the vibrations. The deaf people were amused that all these punks wanted to come in and rent their room and have these shows.\u201d According to artist Winston Smith, \u201cThey put their hands on the table and they could hear the music. It was music they could appreciate because it was so loud.\u201d\u2033<ref>THE ROOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO PUNK: THE DEAF CLUB, 1978-1980</ref>\n\nIn an interview Robert Hanrahan says \"The social aspect of being able to participate and be accepted was big for the deaf people. They enjoyed being exposed to a different subculture like their own. It was very convivial, no fights or hassles.<ref>Deaf Club\n\"I was there...\"\nBy Daphne Hanrahan</ref>\n\n==Walking Dead Records compilation albums==\nThe four partners in [[Walking Dead Records]] developed a live compilation project that resulted in an [[Compilation album|album]] released by Optional Record distribution of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, CA]] on the Walking Dead label: \"Can You Hear Me? Music From the Deaf Club.\" It was recorded on a mobile 8 track by Jim Keylor (also of Army Street Studios), DJ'ed by Johnnie Walker [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/walker/], produced by Robert Hanrahan who also managed and booked the Club, and coordinated by Peter Worrall. The photos selected for the album were taken by Sue Brisk, the [[album art]] was by Diana Miami (aka Diana Stumbo) and the [[liner notes]] were written by V. Vale of [[RE/Search]]/Search & Destroy. It was recorded live at the club during early 1979 and is a testament to the authentic underground punk and \"[[New wave music|new wave]]\" scene during that period in San Francisco's music history. The album featured [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]]' \"Tribute to Russ Meyer\" and \"Monster of Love\" and performances from other first and second generation San Francisco Punk bands like:\n* Offs \u2013 \"Hundred Dollar Limo\", \"Die Babylon\", \"I've Got the Handle\" (Offs were: Don Vinyl, Billy Hawk, Bob Roberts now of Spotlight Tattoo in Los Angeles, Bob Steeler and Denny Boredom who also played with Hot Tuna)\n* Pink Section \u2013 \"Jane Blank\", Francine's List\" & \"Been In The Basement 30 Years\" (Pink Section was: singer Judy Gittelsohn and drummer Carol Detweiler (both members of Inflatable Boy Clams), singer / guitarist Matt Heckert (Survival Research Laboratories), and bassist Stephen Wymore.)\n* Tuxedomoon \u2013 \"19th Nervous Breakdown\", courtesy of [[The Rolling Stones]] and \"Heaven\" from the film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (Tuxedomoon was: Winston Tong, Steven Brown, Blane Reinenger, Peter Carcinogenic (Principle), Greg Langston on drums, With Bruce Geduldig on visuals)\n* KGB \u2013 \"Dying in the USA\" & \"Picture Frame Seduction\"\n* [[Dead Kennedys]] with \"Police Truck\", \"California Uber Alles\", \"Short Songs\" & \"Straight A's\". [[East Bay Ray|Raymond Pepperell, Jr., better known as East Bay Ray]] of the Dead Kennedys used the original two track safety masters from that live eight track recording to release their recent 2004 ''[[Live at the Deaf Club]]'' CD.\n\nFrom the Deaf Club, Walking Dead also produced, with William Passerelli, Dirk Dirksen ([[Mabuhay Gardens]]), Paul Rat Bachavich (Temple Beautiful) & Goody Thompson: the Western Front Festival. The festival engaged the Deaf Club and every venue, (including the \"art clubs\": A.R.E., [[Target Video]], [[Valencia Tool & Die]], Club Foot, the A-hole and Club Generic) in the San Francisco Bay Area that embraced [[punk culture]] and music for a week long event.\n\n==Reviews==\nIn a conversation with Robert Hanrahan at the Deaf Club during a show during the Western Front with one of the Dinettes of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]],[[Joel Selvin]] the [[music critic]] for the [[San Francisco Chronicle|SF Chronicle]] who was attracted by the energy surrounding the punk scene promised to \"put the scene on the map.\"{{Cite quote|date=May 2010}}  Selvin authored an extensive article published in the San Francisco Chronicle, October 22, 1979 on page 6 entitled \"S.F. Goes Punk.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It documented the scene during that time and included interviews with Dirk Dirksen, Joe Rees, Robert Hanrahan, Johnnie Walker and Paul Rat Bachavich. He also mentioned the Deaf Club in a subsequent publication: \"San Francisco: The Musical History Tour : A Guide to over 200 of the Bay Area's Most Memorable Music Sites\" where he disparages the Club as \"one of the stranger scenes on the punk rock scene.\"\n\nTono Rondone, a member of the Frank Hymng Band, which featured Fritz Fox of [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]], remembers a humorous sideline to the history of The Deaf Club: \"At one point, there was a headline in the San Francisco Chronicle which told of the temporary closing of The Deaf Club whose headline read 'Deaf Club Closed Due to Excessive Noise Levels.'\"{{Cite quote|date=May 2010}}\n\nHerb Caen in his daily San Francisco Chronicle column dated Monday August 13, 1979 \"Have a Weird Day\" said: \"I don't know about you, but I find it slightly bizarre that The Deaf Club at 530 Valencia \u2013 indeed a social hangout for deaf people \u2013 features punk rock groups, such as Zen, Off, The Pink Section, Blow Driers and Mutants. \"The louder the better!\" beams Edward Juaregui, executive director of Deaf Self Help. \"We all like to dance, and we can feel the vibrations.\" How about the neighbors? \"Oh,\" continued Edward, \"they're going crazy. They keep calling the cops, complaining the noise is deafening. Isn't that rich?\"\n\nEthan Davison a fan said \"The most interesting thing about the Deaf Club was that it was a real Deaf Club. The members stood around with the rest of us drinking the pow- erful drinks. I don\u2019t sign, so I never \u201cspoke\u201d to any of them, but what I was told was that they enjoyed our music because they could feel the vibrations on the floor. I imagine that they also enjoyed the visual display, for we were the most visually interesting visual community at the time. People would dye their hair a different shade of blue, green, or purple every week. It can now be said that I never had trouble buying a Bloody Mary, even though I was sixteen.\"<ref>the deaf club an un-oral history</ref>\n\nKathy Peck, of the Contractions, remembers the Deaf Club fondly, explaining that, \"The place was filthy. My boots would stick to the floor. The deaf people would dance to the vibration of the beat. Robert Hanrahan would do a radio show with Johnny Walker (BBC punk rock DJ) on the side of the stage, it seems. Robert Hanrahan, manager of the Offs discovered the San Francisco Club for the Deaf in 1978, and was able to rent it on a nightly basis. It was great fun. The Deaf Club was more a like a neighborhood place, very underground, in the Mission District. People would give the deaf sign for a beer as the Offs, the Contractions, Middle Class, No Alternative, and the Dils played. People like Ginger Coyote (Punk Globe) would hang out, dance, and drink. The bathroom was full of graffiti. We\u2019d load in, and the punk bands would always get in crazy fights, especially Brittley Black, drummer of Crime, who fell out of the upstairs window many a night.The deaf people were receptive. They could \u201chear\u201d throughthe wooden floor\u2014a simple floor, made from planks or linoleum. It could catch the vibrations. FrankMoore from the Outrageous Beauty Pageant was there in his wheelchair that people dragged upstairs, since it was on the second floor. Dirk Dirksen (Mabuhay club promoter and San Francisco music icon) nurtured his career.<ref>the deaf club an un-oral history</ref>\n\nAs Bonnie Hayes from the Punts says, \u201cThe club was utterly un-controlled, which was one of the best things about it. It was basically like a big, really messy party at someone's house. It seemed private, like an inside thing --- you would meet everybody and be in the family.\u201d\n\nIn his daily San Francisco Chronicle column dated Monday August 13, 1979, \"Have a Weird Day\",  Herb Caen said:    \n\"I don't know about you, but I find it slightly bizarre that The Deaf Club at 530 Valencia \u2013 indeed a social hangout for deaf people \u2013 features punk rock groups, such as Zen, Off, The Pink Section, Blow Driers and Mutants. \"The louder the better!\" beams Edward Juaregui, executive director of Deaf Self Help. \"We all like to dance, and we can feel the vibrations.\" How about the neighbors? \"Oh,\" continued Edward, \"they're going crazy. They keep calling the cops, complaining the noise is deafening. Isn't that rich?\"\n\nIn a conversation with Klaus Flouride of The Dead Kennedys he looks back at the state of the Deaf club.\"I remember it being working-class, but I don\u2019t remember it being that dingy, but we played an awful lot of pretty dingy punk clubs. That didn\u2019t ever impress upon me that much. I think that \u201cCalifornia \u00dcber Alles\u201d might have come out by the time we played there, but I really don\u2019t think so, because we still had 6025 in the group. So, it was still before we had a single out. We were still early on in the thing. There was a folding table in the back. They sold cans of Budweiser. I think it was for like a buck apiece. Back then, you could get Buds for $2.50 or $3.00 a six-pack, or something like that, so they were doing okay. That was your bar. The thing that impressed me the most was that when we were watching the Germs I was right up front, and I was trying to talk to the person next to me. Everybody was grabbing somebody\u2019s ear and hollering to try and talk, whereas the deaf members, the people who were deaf and frequented the place on an everyday basis, would just lean forward towards the stage and sign each other\u2014 no problem with communication.\"<ref>the deaf club an un oral history</ref>\n\nEsmerelda Kent of Noh Mercy recalls that, \"The Deaf Club was down the street from our \u201chouse\u201d which was a ginormous storefront, 1920s dry goods store on Valencia Street that is now Artists Television Access (ATA Gallery) at 992 Valencia St., where me, Tony Hotel, and our manager (and Tuxedomoon\u2019s manager) Adrian Craig lived. We had a huge basement that had secret passages (connecting all the block) where we used to record and practice.\nThe Deaf Club was my favorite club because of how strange it was. One night after we played at the end of the night, I went backstage and changed and I thought everyone had left because it was so quiet I was sure I was alone. I went out and the room was full with over a hundred people all signing. I wondered if drunk deaf people slurred their sign language.They loved the music because they could feel it. Deafness knows no specific demographic, so rich, poor, old, young, black, Asian, anyone could be and often was deaf and they were all there. Who knew? It was great to write a note of what you wanted to the bartender and see old ladies drinking with spiked mohawk punks.\"\n\n==Closing==\nThe club closed with a party hosted by the artist and filmmaker [[Bruce Conner]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\nThe club had a history of being closed for various reasons, such as by the fire marshal for the lack of sprinklers. Holding private parties with a closed door policy was a way of it continuing to run. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The DEAF CLUB closed after the WESTERN FRONT, a September-October festival of West Coast Bands, which went underreported. As Biafra said, \"The magic of the DEAF CLUB was its intimate sweaty atmosphere, kind of like a great big house party. The club remained raw to the very end.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area}}\n* [[Joel Selvin|Selvin, Joel]]. San Franscisco Chronicle, 22 October 1979, page 6: \"S.F.
