The eastern boundary of Ilkeston is only two miles from Nottingham's western edge and it is part of the [[Nottingham Urban Area]].\n\n==History and culture==\n\nIlkeston was probably founded in the 6th century AD, and gets its name from its supposed founder, Elch or Elcha, who was an [[East Anglia|Anglian]] chieftain (\"Elka's Tun\" = Elka's Town). The town appears as Tilchestune in the [[Domesday Book]] when it was owned principally by Gilbert de Ghent. Gilbert also controlled nearby [[Shipley, Derbyshire|Shipley]], [[West Hallam]] and [[Stanton by Dale]].<ref name = \"Domesday1\">''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''.

There has been evidence of iron working and quarrying in the area since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and the industry began blossoming into a huge industrial concern in the 1780s. By the mid-19th century there were several blast furnaces and the production rose from around 500 tons of pig iron per month to 7,000 at the end of the century. The Stanton Ironworks acquired a number of smaller ironstone quarrying and ironworks companies. These included the [[Wellingborough Tramway|Wellingborough Iron Company]] in 1932.<ref name=Quine>{{Quine ironstone |part=3}}</ref>\n\nSteel pipe manufacturing began at Stanton after [[World War I]] and later concrete pipes were produced, Stanton being the first in the UK to develop the 'spun pipe' process. \n[[File:Ilkeston Stanton Ironworks Wagon small.jpg|thumbnail|left|A restored Stanton Wagon, Chalons Way, Ilkeston]]\nIn the mid-19th century the works produced 20,000 tons of iron castings per year, 2.5 millions by 1905. Up to 12,500 people were employed during the period when the works were part of British Steel Corporation, of which 7,000 worked at the Stanton works.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Scott-Parker iscottparker@pishtush.com |url=http://www.pishtush.com/camwrangler/z031110.html |title=ODAAT: one day at a time...

It is likely that if you live in the UK, you are not far away from a S&S manhole cover or lamp post.\n\nThe works gradually declined, the business being run from 1985 by the French [[Saint-Gobain]] Group.

This makes the fair older than [[Nottingham]]'s famous [[Nottingham Goose Fair|Goose Fair]] and it is one of the largest street fairs in the Country, indeed in Europe.\n\nThe present fair developed from two separate fairs, as another 'agricultural hiring fair' or 'Statutes Fair' was traditionally held on [[Wakes week]] in October as well as the original Charter Fair which was held on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August). The two fairs were combined in 1888 and the one Charter Fair has been held in October ever since.\n\nSince 1931 the fair has been officially opened by the Mayor - first of Ilkeston and since 1974 of [[Borough of Erewash|Erewash]] - on the Fair Thursday at noon with the Town Clerk (Chief Executive)  reading the Charter from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\n==Transport==\n===Railway===\n\nIlkeston did not have a railway station from 1967 to 2017, despite its substantial population and the fact that the [[Midland Main Line]] (formerly part of the [[Midland Railway]], later the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) skirts the eastern edge of the town. Due to recent rail reopenings in similarly-sized towns it was, by some definitions, one of the largest towns in Britain with no railway station. Ilkeston once had three stations. [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]], also known as \"Ilkeston Junction & Cossall\" was on the former [[Midland Railway]] and later [[London Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Erewash Valley Main Line: this station closed in January 1967. A short branch led from this station to [[Ilkeston Town railway station|Ilkeston Town station]], at the north end of Bath Street, which closed to passengers in June 1947.\n\nIlkeston's third station was [[Ilkeston North railway station|Ilkeston North]], on the former [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (later [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]]) line from Nottingham to [[Derby Friargate railway station|Derby Friargate station]], closed in September 1964.  A major feature of this line was [[Bennerley Viaduct]], a {{convert|1452|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|61|ft|m|adj=on}} high, wrought iron structure which still crosses the Erewash valley just to the north east of Ilkeston.  Once threatened with demolition, it is now a Grade 2 listed building, though the removal of the embankments at either end have left it an oddly isolated free-standing structure surrounded by fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceseastwood.co.uk/photo_016.htm|title=Bennerley Viaduct}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced that Ilkeston was one of three sites 'most likely' to get a new station as part of the 'New Stations Fund', costing \u00a35 million and sited close to the old [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-21948348 |title=BBC News |date=26 March 2013 }}</ref> On the 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station would be built, which would be named [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston station]]. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters. A 150 space car park, cycle storage, bus stop, drop off point and taxi rank are also on site. The station is unmanned with automated ticket machines and was originally scheduled to open by the end of 2014.\n\nDue to flood prevention work and the discovery of great crested newts, the opening was significantly delayed.\nThe new station opened on 2 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134611/http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Buses===\n[[TrentBarton]] operate the majority of buses around Ilkeston including the Ilkeston Flyer into Derby, TheTwo and 21 into Nottingham, Black Cat to Mansfield, My15 to Long Eaton and East Midlands Airport <ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/bus-information/route-list}</ref><ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/userfiles/Ilkeston.pdf}</ref>\n[[Notts + Derby]] and CT4N operate some [[Derbyshire County Council]] tendered routes around Ilkeston.<ref>{http://www.derbysbus.info/places_index/ilkeston.html}</ref>\n\n==Ilkeston spa baths==\nFrom early in the 19th century the existence of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath at the bottom of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel.<ref>History of Ilkeston 1899 page 252</ref> For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity.  'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] played one or two [[first-class cricket]] matches per season on the [[Rutland Recreation Ground, Ilkeston|Rutland Recreation Ground]] between 1925 and 1994 and [[List A cricket|one-day matches]] at the ground from 1970 to 1994.\n\nLocal football club [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Ilkeston Town]] was liquidated in 2010, after a 114-year history.

The eastern boundary of Ilkeston is only two miles from Nottingham's western edge and it is part of the [[Nottingham Urban Area]].\n\n==History and culture==\n\nIlkeston was probably founded in the 6th century AD, and gets its name from its supposed founder, Elch or Elcha, who was an [[East Anglia|Anglian]] chieftain (\"Elka's Tun\" = Elka's Town). The town appears as Tilchestune in the [[Domesday Book]] when it was owned principally by Gilbert de Ghent.

There has been evidence of iron working and quarrying in the area since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and the industry began blossoming into a huge industrial concern in the 1780s. By the mid-19th century there were several blast furnaces and the production rose from around 500 tons of pig iron per month to 7,000 at the end of the century. The Stanton Ironworks acquired a number of smaller ironstone quarrying and ironworks companies. These included the [[Wellingborough Tramway|Wellingborough Iron Company]] in 1932.<ref name=Quine>{{Quine ironstone |part=3}}</ref>\n\nSteel pipe manufacturing began at Stanton after World War I and later concrete pipes were produced, Stanton being the first in the UK to develop the 'spun pipe' process. \n[[File:Ilkeston Stanton Ironworks Wagon small.jpg|thumbnail|left|A restored Stanton Wagon, Chalons Way, Ilkeston]]\nIn the mid-19th century the works produced 20,000 tons of iron castings per year, 2.5 millions by 1905. Up to 12,500 people were employed during the period when the works were part of British Steel Corporation, of which 7,000 worked at the Stanton works.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Scott-Parker iscottparker@pishtush.com |url=http://www.pishtush.com/camwrangler/z031110.html |title=ODAAT: one day at a time...

It is likely that if you live in the UK, you are not far away from a S&S manhole cover or lamp post.\n\nThe works gradually declined, the business being run from 1985 by the French [[Saint-Gobain]] Group.

This makes the fair older than [[Nottingham]]'s famous [[Nottingham Goose Fair|Goose Fair]] and it is one of the largest street fairs in the Country, indeed in Europe.\n\nThe present fair developed from two separate fairs, as another 'agricultural hiring fair' or 'Statutes Fair' was traditionally held on [[Wakes week]] in October as well as the original Charter Fair which was held on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August). The two fairs were combined in 1888 and the one Charter Fair has been held in October ever since.\n\nSince 1931 the fair has been officially opened by the Mayor - first of Ilkeston and since 1974 of [[Borough of Erewash|Erewash]] - on the Fair Thursday at noon with the Town Clerk (Chief Executive)  reading the Charter from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\n==Transport==\n===Railway===\n\nIlkeston did not have a railway station from 1967 to 2017, despite its substantial population and the fact that the [[Midland Main Line]] (formerly part of the [[Midland Railway]], later the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) skirts the eastern edge of the town. Due to recent rail reopenings in similarly-sized towns it was, by some definitions, one of the largest towns in Britain with no railway station. Ilkeston once had three stations. [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]], also known as \"Ilkeston Junction & Cossall\" was on the former [[Midland Railway]] and later [[London Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Erewash Valley Main Line: this station closed in January 1967. A short branch led from this station to [[Ilkeston Town railway station|Ilkeston Town station]], at the north end of Bath Street, which closed to passengers in June 1947.\n\nIlkeston's third station was [[Ilkeston North railway station|Ilkeston North]], on the former [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (later [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]]) line from Nottingham to [[Derby Friargate railway station|Derby Friargate station]], closed in September 1964.  A major feature of this line was [[Bennerley Viaduct]], a {{convert|1452|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|61|ft|m|adj=on}} high, wrought iron structure which still crosses the Erewash valley just to the north east of Ilkeston.  Once threatened with demolition, it is now a Grade 2 listed building, though the removal of the embankments at either end have left it an oddly isolated free-standing structure surrounded by fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceseastwood.co.uk/photo_016.htm|title=Bennerley Viaduct}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced that Ilkeston was one of three sites 'most likely' to get a new station as part of the 'New Stations Fund', costing \u00a35 million and sited close to the old [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-21948348 |title=BBC News |date=26 March 2013 }}</ref> On the 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station would be built, which would be named [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston station]]. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters. A 150 space car park, cycle storage, bus stop, drop off point and taxi rank are also on site. The station is unmanned with automated ticket machines and was originally scheduled to open by the end of 2014.\n\nDue to flood prevention work and the discovery of great crested newts, the opening was significantly delayed.\nThe new station opened on 2 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134611/http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Buses===\n[[TrentBarton]] operate the majority of buses around Ilkeston including the Ilkeston Flyer into Derby, TheTwo and 21 into Nottingham, Black Cat to Mansfield, My15 to Long Eaton and East Midlands Airport <ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/bus-information/route-list}</ref><ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/userfiles/Ilkeston.pdf}</ref>\n[[Notts + Derby]] and CT4N operate some [[Derbyshire County Council]] tendered routes around Ilkeston.<ref>{http://www.derbysbus.info/places_index/ilkeston.html}</ref>\n\n==Ilkeston spa baths==\nFrom early in the 19th century the existence of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath at the bottom of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel.<ref>History of Ilkeston 1899 page 252</ref> For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity.  'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] played one or two [[first-class cricket]] matches per season on the [[Rutland Recreation Ground, Ilkeston|Rutland Recreation Ground]] between 1925 and 1994 and [[List A cricket|one-day matches]] at the ground from 1970 to 1994.\n\nLocal football club [[Ilkeston Town F.C.
