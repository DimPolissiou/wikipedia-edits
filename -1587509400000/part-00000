The screenplay by [[Melvyn Bragg]], based on ''Beloved Friend'', a collection of personal correspondence edited by Catherine Drinker Bowen and Barbara von Meck, focuses on the life and career of 19th-century Russian composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. It was one of the director's [[biographical film]]s about classical composers, which include ''[[Elgar (film)|Elgar]]'' (1962), ''[[Song of Summer|Delius: Song of Summer]]'' (1968), ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]'' (1974) and ''[[Lisztomania (film)|Lisztomania]]'' (1975), made from an often idiosyncratic standpoint.\n\n==Synopsis==\nMuch of the film is without dialogue and the story is presented in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[nightmare]]s, and [[fantasy]] sequences set to Tchaikovsky's music. As a child, the composer sees his mother die horribly, forcibly immersed in scalding water as a supposed cure for [[cholera]], and is haunted by the scene throughout his musical career. Despite his difficulty in establishing his reputation, he attracts Madame [[Nadezhda von Meck]] as his patron. His marriage to the [[nymphomania]]cal [[Antonina Miliukova]] is plagued by his homosexual urges and [[lust]]ful desire for Count Anton Chiluvsky. The dynamics of his life lead to deteriorating mental health and the loss of von Meck's patronage, and he dies of cholera after deliberately drinking contaminated water.\n\nThanks ==Cast==\n*[[Richard Chamberlain]]...

Russell had made a number of movies on television about composers and artists, including Debussy and Richard Strauss, and suggested a biopic of Tchaikovsky, who he had long admired.

The church was erected in the 18th century and remained in use until a few years after the erection of the new church in Corlough in 1857. It was made of wood with dimensions of 54&nbsp;ft x 22&nbsp;ft x 8.5&nbsp;ft. Local tradition states that Father John Ward, the parish priest of Templeport from 1758-1795, rode his horse from [[Bawnboy]] to Arderry Church to celebrate Mass each Sunday and had breakfast with the local teacher John O'Hara whose school was also held at the church and who also held a Sunday School there. The 6 inch 1836 OS map depicts the church and school and the 1836 OS Namebooks state- ''There is a Roman Catholic chapel at the east side of the townland capable of holding 250 persons''.[[File:Site of former Arderry Roman Catholic Church, Arderry townland, Corlough parish, County Cavan, Republic of Ireland.jpg|thumb|Site of former Arderry Roman Catholic Church, Arderry townland, Corlough parish, County Cavan, Republic of Ireland]]\n# The site of Arderry National School, Roll No. 7219.

Turner and R. Gary Stauffer. One hundred students enrolled at the new school, which was initially located in a 19th-century mansion in [[Alma, Michigan]]. Northwood Institute moved to Midland, Michigan, in 1961.<ref name=PETE>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUOLgwyEUKAC&pg=PA2104 Peterson's Four-Year Coilleges by Thomson Peterson, page 2101-2104, Northwood University]</ref>\n\nThe [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] operated a [[seminary]] known as ''West Baden College'' at the former [[West Baden Springs Hotel]], in [[Orange County, Indiana]], from 1934 until June 1964, when declining enrollment forced the closure of the facility. They sold the property to a Michigan couple, who in turn donated it to Northwood Institute, which operated a [[satellite campus]] of their business management school under the great dome on the property from 1966 until 1983, when it was closed.<ref name=RESORT>[https://www.frenchlick.com/history French Lick Resort website: History-West Baden Springs Hotel]</ref> During the same time frame during which the Indiana campus was opened, a Northwood facility was also established in Texas, which continues to serve students in the Southwest United States.\n[[File:NorthwoodAdmin.jpg|thumb|left|Midland's Church Family Administration building]]\n\nIn 1982, David E. Fry became president of the school. The Florida residential campus was added and the academic curricula was expanded. The school was accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].<ref name=ACCREDITED>[https://www.hlcommission.org/?option=com_directory&Action=ShowBasic&instid=1356 Higher Learning Commission]</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the name was changed from ''Northwood Institute'' to Northwood University and The DeVos Graduate School of Management was created. A joint program with the [[Hotel Institute Montreux]] was established in 2001 to combine Swiss hospitality traditions with American management practices. The school, located in [[Montreux, Switzerland]] was Northwood University's first international venture. University College program centers were expanded for a total of 40 locations in eight states and program centers were begun in [[Bahrain]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Switzerland]].\n\nIn October 2007, Keith A.

In his first season, he eclipsed 100 rushing yards in six games and became only the fourth freshman in Ohio State history to eclipse the 1,000 yard rushing mark in a season. During the [[2017 Big Ten Football Championship Game]], Dobbins overtook [[Maurice Clarett]] for the most rushing yards by a Freshman with his 174-yard, MVP performance. During a 24\u20137 [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl Classic]] win against [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]], Dobbins set the Freshman rushing record at 1,403 yards.\n\nDespite a record-setting 2017 season , Dobbins' would once again split time with Weber during his Sophomore year. The time split paired with [[Dwayne Haskins]]' award-winning performance at quarterback lead to a decrease in productivity for Dobbins. He ended the season with 1,053 yards rushing, but remained the team's leading rusher. Notably, he had his first 200+ yard rushing game against [[2018 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]].\n\nIn 2019, Dobbins would enter his Junior season with high expectations. These expectations were met when he went on to gain 100+ yards in ten games during the season. This included a four-touchdown performance against [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] that stemmed from 211 yards rushing. He finished his season as the only Buckeye in history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, passing [[Eddie George]]. Dobbins was a [[Doak Walker Award]] finalist and finished sixth for the [[Heisman Trophy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://buckeyeswire.usatoday.com/2019/12/15/ohio-state-three-of-the-top-six-in-heisman-voting/ |title=Ohio State ends up with three of the top six in Heisman voting |last=Harrison |first=Phil |date=December 15, 2019 |website=Buckeyes Wire |language=en |access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref> He was named First Team All-Big Ten and First Team All-American as an All-Purpose player by the [[Football Writers Association of America]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.elevenwarriors.com/ohio-state-football/2019/12/110504/jk-dobbins-named-first-team-all-american-by-fwaa-earning-a-tree-in-buckeye-grove |title=J.K.

In his first season, he eclipsed 100 rushing yards in six games and became only the fourth freshman in Ohio State history to eclipse the 1,000 yard rushing mark in a season. During the [[2017 Big Ten Football Championship Game]], Dobbins overtook [[Maurice Clarett]] for the most rushing yards by a Freshman with his 174-yard, MVP performance. During a 24\u20137 [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl Classic]] win against [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]], Dobbins set the Freshman rushing record at 1,403 yards.\n\nDespite a record-setting 2017 season , Dobbins' would once again split time with Weber during his Sophomore year. The time split paired with [[Dwayne Haskins]]' award-winning performance at quarterback lead to a decrease in productivity for Dobbins. He ended the season with 1,053 yards rushing, but remained the team's leading rusher. Notably, he had his first 200+ yard rushing game against [[2018 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]].\n\nIn 2019, Dobbins would enter his Junior season with high expectations. These expectations were met when he went on to gain 100+ yards in ten games during the season. This included a four-touchdown performance against [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] that stemmed from 211 yards rushing. He finished his season as the only Buckeye in history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, passing [[Eddie George]]. Dobbins was a [[Doak Walker Award]] finalist and finished sixth for the [[Heisman Trophy]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://buckeyeswire.usatoday.com/2019/12/15/ohio-state-three-of-the-top-six-in-heisman-voting/ |title=Ohio State ends up with three of the top six in Heisman voting |last=Harrison |first=Phil |date=December 15, 2019 |website=Buckeyes Wire |language=en |access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>.
