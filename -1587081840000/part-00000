Discuss navigation concept at [[Talk:Do_while_loop#Helpbox_experiment] -->\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''for-loop''' (or simply '''for loop''')  is a [[control flow]] [[statement (programming)|statement]] for specifying [[iteration]], which allows code to be [[execution (computers)|executed]] repeatedly. Various keywords are used to specify this statement: descendants of [[ALGOL]] use \"for\", while descendants of [[Fortran]] use \"do\". There are other possibilities, for example [[COBOL]] which uses \"PERFORM VARYING\".\n\nA for-loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit [[For loop#Loop counters|loop counter]] or loop variable, which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop variable.\n\nThe name ''for-loop'' comes from the English word [[Wiktionary:for|for]], which is used as the [[Keyword (computing)|keyword]] in many programming languages to introduce a for-loop. The term in English dates to [[ALGOL 58]] and was popularized in the influential later [[ALGOL 60]]; it is the direct translation of the earlier German '''[[wikt:f\u00fcr|f\u00fcr]]''', used in ''[[Superplan]]'' (1949\u20131951) by [[Heinz Rutishauser]], who also was involved in defining ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. The loop body is executed \"for\" the given values of the loop variable, though this is more explicit in the [[ALGOL]] version of the statement, in which a list of possible values and/or increments can be specified.\n\nIn [[FORTRAN]] and [[PL/I]], the keyword ''DO'' is used for the same thing and it is called a '''do-loop'''; this is different from a [[do while loop|do-while loop]].\n\n== FOR ==\n[[File:For loop.png|thumb|350px|For loop illustration, from i=0 to i=2, resulting in data1=200]]\nA for-loop statement is available in most [[imperative programming]] languages. Even ignoring minor differences in [[syntax]] there are many differences in how these statements work and the level of expressiveness they support. Generally, for-loops fall into one of the following categories:\n\n=== Traditional for-loops ===\nThe for-loop of languages like [[ALGOL]], [[Simula]], [[BASIC]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula]], [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Matlab]], [[Ocaml]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], and so on, requires a control variable with start- and end-values and looks something like this:\n<syntaxhighlight Lang=\"pascal\">\nfor i = first to last do statement\n(* or just *)\nfor i = first..last do statement\n</syntaxhighlight>\nDepending on the language, an explicit [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] sign may be used in place of the [[equal sign]] (and some languages require the word {{code|int}} even in the numerical case). An optional step-value (an increment or decrement \u2260 1) may also be included, although the exact syntaxes used for this differs a bit more between the languages. Some languages require a separate declaration of the control variable, some do not.\n\nAnother form was popularized by the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. It requires 3 parts: the [[Declaration (computer programming)|initialization]], the [[Boolean algebra|condition]], and the [[Code cleanup|afterthought]] and all these three parts are optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/57-for-statements/|title=For loops in C++}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tutorialcup.com/cplusplus/for-loop.htm|title=C++ For Loop}}</ref>\n\nThe initialization declares (and perhaps assigns to) any variables required. The type of a variable should be same if you are using multiple variables in initialization part. The condition checks a condition, and quits the loop if false. The afterthought is performed exactly once every time the loop ends and then repeats.\n\nHere is an example of the traditional for-loop in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].\n\n<syntaxhighlight Lang=\"java\">\n// Prints the numbers from 0 to 99 (and not 100), each followed by a space.\nfor (int i=0; i<100; i++)  \n{\n    System.out.print(i);\n    System.out.print(' ');\n}\nSystem.out.println();\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThese loops are also sometimes called '''numeric for-loops''' when contrasted with '''foreach loops'''(see below).\n\n=== Iterator-based for-loops ===\n{{Main|Foreach loop}}\nThis type of for-loop is a generalisation of the numeric range type of for-loop, as it allows for the enumeration of sets of items other than number sequences. It is usually characterized by the use of an implicit or explicit [[iterator]], in which the loop variable takes on each of the values in a sequence or other data collection. A representative example in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is:\n\n<syntaxhighlight Lang=\"python\">\nfor item in some_iterable_object:\n    do_something()\n    do_something_else()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWhere {{code|some_iterable_object}} is either a data collection that supports implicit iteration (like a list of employee's names), or may in fact be an iterator itself. Some languages have this in addition to another for-loop syntax; notably, PHP has this type of loop under the name {{code|for each}}, as well as a three-expression for-loop (see below) under the name {{code|for}}.\n\n=== Vectorised for-loops ===\nSome languages offer a for-loop that acts as if processing all iterations [[Automatic vectorization|in parallel]], such as the {{code|for all}} keyword in [[FORTRAN 95]] which has the interpretation that ''all'' [[Sides of an equation|right-hand-side]] expressions are evaluated before ''any'' assignments are made, as distinct from the explicit iteration form. For example, in the {{code|for}} statement in the following pseudocode fragment, when calculating the new value for {{code|A(i)}}, except for the first (with {{code|i = 2}}) the reference to {{code|A(i - 1)}} will obtain the new value that had been placed there in the previous step. In the {{code|for all}} version, however, each calculation refers only to the original, unaltered {{code|A}}.\n '''for'''     i := 2 : N - 1 '''do''' A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3; '''next''' i;\n '''for all''' i := 2 : N - 1 '''do''' A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3;\nThe difference may be significant.\n\nSome languages (such as FORTRAN 95, PL/I) also offer array assignment statements, that enable many for-loops to be omitted. Thus pseudocode such as {{code|A := 0;}} would set all elements of array A to zero, no matter its size or dimensionality. The example loop could be rendered as \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\n A(2 : N - 1) := [A(1 : N - 2) + A(2 : N - 1) + A(3 : N)] / 3;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nBut whether that would be rendered in the style of the for-loop or the for all-loop or something else may not be clearly described in the compiler manual.\n\n===Compound for-loops===\nIntroduced with [[ALGOL 68]] and followed by [[PL/I]], this allows the iteration of a loop to be compounded with a test, as in\n for i := 1 : N while A(i) > 0 do ''etc.''\nThat is, a value is assigned to the loop variable ''i'' and only if the ''while expression'' is '''true''' will the loop body be executed. If the result were '''false''' the for-loop's execution stops short. Granted that the loop variable's value ''is'' defined after the termination of the loop, then the above statement will find the first non-positive element in array ''A'' (and if no such, its value will be ''N + 1''), or, with suitable variations, the first non-blank character in a string, and so on.\n\n\n== Loop counters ==\n\nIn [[computer programming]] a '''loop counter''' is the [[variable (programming)|variable]] that controls the iterations of a loop (a computer [[programming language]] construct).  It is so named because most uses of this construct result in the variable taking on a range of integer values in some orderly sequences (example., starting at 0 and end at 10 in increments of 1)\n\nLoop counters change with each [[iteration]] of a loop, providing a unique value for each individual iteration. The loop counter is used to decide when the loop should terminate and for the program flow to continue to the next [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] after the loop.\n\nA common [[identifier naming convention]] is for the loop counter to use the variable names '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' (and so on if needed), where '''i''' would be the most outer loop, '''j''' the next inner loop, etc. The reverse order is also used by some programmers. This style is generally agreed to have originated from the early programming of [[FORTRAN]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, where these variable names beginning with these letters were implicitly declared as having an integer type, and so were obvious choices for loop counters that were only temporarily required. The practice dates back further to [[mathematical notation]] where [[index notation|indices]] for [[summation|sums]] and [[multiplication]]s are often '''i''', '''j''', etc. A variant convention is the use of reduplicated letters for the index, '''ii''', '''jj''', and '''kk''', as this allows easier searching and search-replacing than using a single letter.<ref>http://www.knosof.co.uk/vulnerabilities/loopcntrl.pdf Analysis of loop control variables in C</ref>\n\n===Example===\nAn example of [[C (programming language)|C]] code involving nested for loops, where the loop counter variables are '''i''' and '''j''':\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n    for (j = i; j < 10; j++) {\n        some_function(i, j);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt has been shown that a nested for loop, as in above example, performs more computations per unit time than a loop without it. This machine-independent optimisation means the nested for loop will finish faster, given the same number of computations to perform. This is an advantage nested for loop has over nested while loop, which behaves differently.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1515/comp-2018-0004 Inner loop program construct: A faster way for program execution]</ref>\n\nFor loops in C can also be used to print the reverse of a word. As:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (i = 0; i < 6; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%c\", &a[i]);\n}\nfor (i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {\n    printf(\"%c\", a[i]);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHere, if the input is {{code|apple}}, the output will be {{code|elppa}}.\n\n==Additional semantics and constructs==\n\n===Use as infinite loops===\nThis C-style for-loop is commonly the source of an [[infinite loop]] since the fundamental steps of iteration are completely in the control of the programmer. In fact, when infinite loops are intended, this type of for-loop can be used (with empty expressions), such as:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (;;)\n    //loop body\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis style is used instead of infinite {{code|while (1)}} loops to avoid a type conversion warning in some C/C++ compilers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Compiler Warning (level 4) C4127 |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t66728h.aspx |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> Some programmers prefer the more succinct {{code|for (;;)}} form over the semantically equivalent but more verbose {{code|while (true)}} form.\n\n===Early exit and continuation===\nSome languages may also provide other supporting statements, which when present can alter how the for-loop iteration proceeds.\nCommon among these are the [[break statement|break]] and [[Control flow#Continuation with next iteration|continue]] statements found in C and its derivatives.\nThe break statement causes the inner-most loop to be terminated immediately when executed.\nThe continue statement will move at once to the next iteration without further progress through the loop body for the current iteration.\nA for statement also terminates when a break, goto, or return statement within the statement body is executed. [Wells]\nOther languages may have similar statements or otherwise provide means to alter the for-loop progress; for example in FORTRAN 95:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nDO I = 1, N\n  statements               !Executed for all values of \"I\", up to a disaster if any.\n  IF (no good) CYCLE       !Skip this value of \"I\", continue with the next.\n  statements               !Executed only where goodness prevails.\n  IF (disaster) EXIT       !Abandon the loop.\n  statements               !While good and, no disaster.\nEND DO                     !Should align with the \"DO\".\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nSome languages offer further facilities such as naming the various loop statements so that with multiple nested loops there is no doubt as to which loop is involved. Fortran 95, for example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nX1:DO I = 1,N\n     statements\n  X2:DO J = 1,M\n       statements\n       IF (trouble) CYCLE X1\n       statements\n     END DO X2\n     statements\n   END DO X1\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThus, when \"trouble\" is detected in the inner loop, the CYCLE X1 (not X2) means that the skip will be to the next iteration for I, ''not'' J. The compiler will also be checking that each END DO has the appropriate label for its position: this is not just a documentation aid. The programmer must still code the problem correctly, but some possible blunders will be blocked.\n\n===Loop variable scope and semantics===\nDifferent languages specify different rules for what value the loop variable will hold on termination of its loop, and indeed some hold that it \"becomes undefined\". This permits a [[compiler]] to generate code that leaves any value in the loop variable, or perhaps even leaves it unchanged because the loop value was held in a register and never stored to memory. Actual behaviour may even vary according to the compiler's optimization settings, as with the Honywell Fortran66 compiler.\n\nIn some languages (not [[C (language)|C]] or [[C++]]) the loop variable is [[Immutable object|immutable]] within the scope of the loop body, with any attempt to modify its value being regarded as a semantic error. Such modifications are sometimes a consequence of a programmer error, which can be very difficult to identify once made. However, only overt changes are likely to be detected by the compiler. Situations where the address of the loop variable is passed as an argument to a [[subroutine]] make it very difficult to check, because the routine's behavior is in general unknowable to the compiler. Some examples in the style of Fortran:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nDO I = 1, N\n  I = 7                           !Overt adjustment of the loop variable. Compiler complaint likely.\n  Z = ADJUST(I)                   !Function \"ADJUST\" might alter \"I\", to uncertain effect.\n  normal statements               !Memory might fade that \"I\" is the loop variable.\n  PRINT (A(I), B(I), I = 1, N, 2) !Implicit for-loop to print odd elements of arrays A and B, reusing \"I\"...\n  PRINT I                         !What value will be presented?\nEND DO                            !How many times will the loop be executed?\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA common approach is to calculate the iteration count at the start of a loop (with careful attention to overflow as in {{code|for i := 0 : 65535 do ... ;}} in sixteen-bit integer arithmetic) and with each iteration decrement this count while also adjusting the value of {{code|I}}: double counting results. However, adjustments to the value of {{code|I}} within the loop will not change the number of iterations executed.\n\nStill another possibility is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value may or may not be copied to {{code|I}} on each iteration. Again, modifications of {{code|I}} would not affect the control of the loop, but now a disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of {{code|I}} might be to the (possibly altered) current value of {{code|I}} or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element {{code|I}} of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), but if {{code|I}} is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a ''print''-statement to reveal its value), it would likely be a reference to the proper variable {{code|I}} instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities.\n\n====Adjustment of bounds====\nJust as the index variable might be modified within a for-loop, so also may its bounds and direction. But to uncertain effect. A compiler may prevent such attempts, they may have no effect, or they might even work properly - though many would declare that to do so would be wrong. Consider a statement such as \n '''for''' i := first : last : step '''do'''\n   A(i) := A(i) / A(last);\nIf the approach to compiling such a loop was to be the evaluation of ''first'', ''last'' and ''step'' and the calculation of an iteration count via something like ''(last - first)/step'' once only at the start, then if those items were simple variables and their values were somehow adjusted during the iterations, this would have no effect on the iteration count even if the element selected for division by ''A(last)'' changed.\n\n===List of value ranges===\nPL/I and Algol 68, allows loops in which the loop variable is iterated over a list of ranges of values instead of a single range. The following PL/I example will execute the loop with six values of i: 1, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15:\n<pre>\ndo i = 1, 7, 12 to 15;\n  /*statements*/\nend;\n</pre>\n\n== Equivalence with while-loops ==\n===In theory===\nA for-loop can be converted into an equivalent while-loop by incrementing a counter variable directly. The following [[pseudocode]] illustrates this technique:\n\n factorial := 1\n  for counter from 1 to 5\n      factorial := factorial * counter\n\nis easily translated into the following while-loop:\n\n factorial := 1\n  counter := 1\n  while counter <= 5\n     factorial := factorial * counter\n     counter := counter + 1\n\nThis translation is slightly complicated by languages which allow a statement to jump to the next iteration of the loop (such as the \"continue\" statement in C). These statements will typically implicitly increment the counter of a for-loop, but not the equivalent while-loop (since in the latter case the counter is not an integral part of the loop construct). Any translation will have to place all such statements within a block that increments the explicit counter before running the statement.\n\n=== In practice ===\nThe formal equivalence applies only in so far as computer arithmetic also follows the axia of mathematics, in particular that x + 1 > x. Actual computer arithmetic suffers from the overflow of limited representations so that for example in sixteen-bit unsigned arithmetic, 65535 + 1 comes out as zero, because 65536 cannot be represented in unsigned sixteen-bit. Similar problems arise for other sizes, signed or unsigned, and for [[Saturation arithmetic|saturated arithmetic]] where 65535 + 1 would produce 65535. Compiler writers will handle the likes of {{code|for counter := 0 to 65535 do ... next counter}}, possibly by producing code that inspects the state of a hardware \"overflow\" indicator, but unless there is some provision for the equivalent checking after calculating {{code|counter := counter + 1;}} the while-loop equivalence will fail because the counter will never exceed 65535 and so the loop will never end - unless some other mishap occurs.\n\n== Timeline of the ''for-loop'' syntax in various programming languages ==\nGiven an action that must be repeated, for instance, five times, different languages' for-loops will be written differently. The syntax for a three-expression for-loop is nearly identical in all languages that have it, after accounting for different styles of block termination and so on.\n\n===1957: FORTRAN===\nFortran's equivalent of the {{code|for}} loop is the {{code|DO}} loop, \nusing the keyword do instead of for, \nThe syntax of Fortran's {{code|DO}} loop is:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\n        DO label counter = first, last, step\n          statements\nlabel     statement\n</syntaxhighlight> \nThe following two examples behave equivalently to the three argument for-loop in other languages, \ninitializing the counter variable to 1, incrementing by 1 each iteration of the loop and stopping at five (inclusive).\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\n        DO 9, COUNTER = 1, 5, 1\n          WRITE (6,8) COUNTER\n    8     FORMAT( I2 )\n    9   CONTINUE\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIn Fortran 77 (or later), this may also be written as: \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\ndo counter = 1, 5\n  write(*, '(i2)') counter\nend do\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe step part may be omitted if the step is one. Example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\n* DO loop example.\n       PROGRAM MAIN\n         SUM SQ = 0\n         DO 199 I = 1, 9999999\n           IF (SUM SQ.GT.1000) GO TO 200\n199        SUM SQ = SUM SQ + I**2\n200      PRINT 206, SUMSQ\n206      FORMAT( I2 )\n       END\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSpaces are irrelevant in fixed-form Fortran statements, thus {{code|SUM SQ}} is the same as {{code|SUMSQ}}.  In the modern free-form Fortran style, blanks are significant.\n\nIn Fortran 90, the {{code|GO TO}} may be avoided by using an {{code|EXIT}} statement.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\n* DO loop example.\n       program main\n         implicit none\n\n         integer :: sumsq\n         integer :: i\n\n         sumsq = 0\n         do i = 1, 9999999\n           if (sumsq > 1000.0) exit\n           sumsq = sumsq + i**2\n          end do\n         print *, sumsq\n\n       end program\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1958: Algol===\n[[ALGOL|Algol]] was first formalised in the Algol58 report.\n\n===1960: COBOL===\nCOBOL was formalized in late 1959 and has had many elaborations. It uses the PERFORM verb which has many options, with the later addition of \"structured\" statements such as END-PERFORM. Ignoring the need for declaring and initialising variables, the equivalent of a ''for''-loop would be\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n      PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 1000\n             ADD I**2 TO SUM-SQ.\n      END-PERFORM\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIf the PERFORM verb has the optional clause TEST AFTER, the resulting loop is slightly different: the loop body is executed at least once, before any test.\n\n===1964: BASIC===\nLoops in [[BASIC]] are sometimes called for-next loops.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"basic\">\n10 REM THIS FOR LOOP PRINTS ODD NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 15\n20 FOR I = 1 TO 15 STEP 2\n30 PRINT I\n40 NEXT I\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNotice that the end-loop marker specifies the name of the index variable, which must correspond to the name of the index variable in the start of the for-loop. Some languages (PL/I, FORTRAN 95 and later) allow a statement label on the start of a for-loop that can be matched by the compiler against the same text on the corresponding end-loop statement. Fortran also allows the {{code|EXIT}} and {{code|CYCLE}} statements to name this text; in a nest of loops this makes clear which loop is intended. However, in these languages the labels must be unique, so successive loops involving the same index variable cannot use the same text nor can a label be the same as the name of a variable, such as the index variable for the loop.\n\n===1964: PL/I===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"rexx\">\ndo counter = 1 to 5 by 1; /* \"by 1\" is the default if not specified */\n  /*statements*/;\n  end;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe {{mono|LEAVE}} statement may be used to exit the loop. Loops can be labeled, and ''leave'' may leave a specific labeled loop in a group of nested loops. Some PL/I dialects include the {{mono|ITERATE}} statement to terminate the current loop iteration and begin the next.\n\n===1968: Algol 68===\n[[Algol68]] has what was considered ''the'' universal loop, the full syntax is:\n<pre>\nFOR i FROM 1 BY 2 TO 3 WHILE i\u22604 DO ~ OD\n</pre>\n\nFurther, the single iteration range could be replaced by a list of such ranges. There are several unusual aspects of the construct\n* only the {{code|do ~ od}} portion was compulsory, in which case the loop will iterate indefinitely.\n* thus the clause {{code|to 100 do ~ od}}, will iterate exactly 100 times.\n* the {{code|while}} ''syntactic element'' allowed a programmer to break from a {{code|for}} loop early, as in:\n<pre>\nINT sum sq := 0;\nFOR i\n WHILE\n  print((\"So far:\", i, new line)); # Interposed for tracing purposes. #\n  sum sq \u2260 70\u21912                    # This is the test for the WHILE   #\nDO\n  sum sq +:= i\u21912\nOD\n</pre>\n\nSubsequent ''extensions'' to the standard Algol68 allowed the {{code|to}} syntactic element to be replaced with {{code|{{sic|hide=y|up|to}}}} and {{code|downto}} to achieve a small optimization. The same compilers also incorporated:\n;{{code|until}}: for late loop termination.\n;{{code|foreach}}: for working on arrays in [[parallel computing|parallel]].\n\n===1970: Pascal===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\">\nfor Counter := 1 to 5 do\n  (*statement*);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nDecrementing (counting backwards) is using {{code|downto}} keyword instead of {{code|to}}, as in:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\">\nfor Counter := 5 downto 1 do\n  (*statement*);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe numeric-range for-loop varies somewhat more.\n\n===1972: C/C++===\n{{further|C syntax#Iteration statements}}\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)\n    statement\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe <tt>statement</tt> is often a block statement; an example of this would be:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n//Using for-loops to add numbers 1 - 5\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < 6; ++i) {\n    sum += i;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe ISO/IEC 9899:1999 publication (commonly known as [[C99]]) also allows initial declarations in {{code|for}} loops. All the three sections in the for loop are optional.\n\n===1972: Smalltalk===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"smalltalk\">1 to: 5 do: [ :counter | \"statements\" ]</syntaxhighlight>\nContrary to other languages, in [[Smalltalk]] a for-loop is not a [[language construct]] but defined in the class Number as a method with two parameters, the end value and a [[Closure (computer science)|closure]], using self as start value.\n\n===1980: Ada===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nfor Counter in 1 .. 5 loop\n   -- statements\nend loop;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe ''exit'' statement may be used to exit the loop.

Discuss navigation concept at [[Talk:Do_while_loop#Helpbox_experiment] -->\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''for-loop''' (or simply '''for loop''')  is a [[control flow]] [[statement (programming)|statement]] for specifying [[iteration]], which allows code to be [[execution (computers)|executed]] repeatedly. Various keywords are used to specify this statement: descendants of [[ALGOL]] use \"for\", while descendants of [[Fortran]] use \"do\". There are other possibilities, for example [[COBOL]] which uses \"PERFORM VARYING\".\n\nA for-loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit [[For loop#Loop counters|loop counter]] or loop variable, which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop variable.\n\nThe name ''for-loop'' comes from the English word [[Wiktionary:for|for]], which is used as the [[Keyword (computing)|keyword]] in many programming languages to introduce a for-loop. The term in English dates to [[ALGOL 58]] and was popularized in the influential later [[ALGOL 60]]; it is the direct translation of the earlier German '''[[wikt:f\u00fcr|f\u00fcr]]''', used in ''[[Superplan]]'' (1949\u20131951) by [[Heinz Rutishauser]], who also was involved in defining ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. The loop body is executed \"for\" the given values of the loop variable, though this is more explicit in the [[ALGOL]] version of the statement, in which a list of possible values and/or increments can be specified.\n\nIn [[FORTRAN]] and [[PL/I]], the keyword ''DO'' is used for the same thing and it is called a '''do-loop'''; this is different from a [[do while loop|do-while loop]].\n\n== FOR ==\n[[File:For loop.png|thumb|350px|For loop illustration, from i=0 to i=2, resulting in data1=200]]\nA for-loop statement is available in most [[imperative programming]] languages. Even ignoring minor differences in [[syntax]] there are many differences in how these statements work and the level of expressiveness they support. Generally, for-loops fall into one of the following categories:\n\n=== Traditional for-loops ===\nThe for-loop of languages like [[ALGOL]], [[Simula]], [[BASIC]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula]], [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Matlab]], [[Ocaml]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], and so on, requires a control variable with start- and end-values and looks something like this:\n<syntaxhighlight Lang=\"pascal\">\nfor i = first to last do statement\n(* or just *)\nfor i = first..last do statement\n</syntaxhighlight>\nDepending on the language, an explicit [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] sign may be used in place of the [[equal sign]] (and some languages require the word {{code|int}} even in the numerical case). An optional step-value (an increment or decrement \u2260 1) may also be included, although the exact syntaxes used for this differs a bit more between the languages. Some languages require a separate declaration of the control variable, some do not.\n\nAnother form was popularized by the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. It requires 3 parts: the [[Declaration (computer programming)|initialization]], the [[Boolean algebra|condition]], and the [[Code cleanup|afterthought]] and all these three parts are optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/57-for-statements/|title=For loops in C++}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tutorialcup.com/cplusplus/for-loop.htm|title=C++ For Loop}}</ref>\n\nThe initialization declares (and perhaps assigns to) any variables required. The type of a variable should be same if you are using multiple variables in initialization part. The condition checks a condition, and quits the loop if false. The afterthought is performed exactly once every time the loop ends and then repeats.\n\nHere is an example of the traditional for-loop in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].\n\n<syntaxhighlight Lang=\"java\">\n// Prints the numbers from 0 to 99 (and not 100), each followed by a space.\nfor (int i=0; i<100; i++)  \n{\n    System.out.print(i);\n    System.out.print(' ');\n}\nSystem.out.println();\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThese loops are also sometimes called '''numeric for-loops''' when contrasted with '''foreach loops'''(see below).\n\n=== Iterator-based for-loops ===\n{{Main|Foreach loop}}\nThis type of for-loop is a generalisation of the numeric range type of for-loop, as it allows for the enumeration of sets of items other than number sequences. It is usually characterized by the use of an implicit or explicit [[iterator]], in which the loop variable takes on each of the values in a sequence or other data collection. A representative example in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is:\n\n<syntaxhighlight Lang=\"python\">\nfor item in some_iterable_object:\n    do_something()\n    do_something_else()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWhere {{code|some_iterable_object}} is either a data collection that supports implicit iteration (like a list of employee's names), or may in fact be an iterator itself. Some languages have this in addition to another for-loop syntax; notably, PHP has this type of loop under the name {{code|for each}}, as well as a three-expression for-loop (see below) under the name {{code|for}}.\n\n=== Vectorised for-loops ===\nSome languages offer a for-loop that acts as if processing all iterations [[Automatic vectorization|in parallel]], such as the {{code|for all}} keyword in [[FORTRAN 95]] which has the interpretation that ''all'' [[Sides of an equation|right-hand-side]] expressions are evaluated before ''any'' assignments are made, as distinct from the explicit iteration form. For example, in the {{code|for}} statement in the following pseudocode fragment, when calculating the new value for {{code|A(i)}}, except for the first (with {{code|i = 2}}) the reference to {{code|A(i - 1)}} will obtain the new value that had been placed there in the previous step. In the {{code|for all}} version, however, each calculation refers only to the original, unaltered {{code|A}}.\n '''for'''     i := 2 : N - 1 '''do''' A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3; '''next''' i;\n '''for all''' i := 2 : N - 1 '''do''' A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3;\nThe difference may be significant.\n\nSome languages (such as FORTRAN 95, PL/I) also offer array assignment statements, that enable many for-loops to be omitted. Thus pseudocode such as {{code|A := 0;}} would set all elements of array A to zero, no matter its size or dimensionality. The example loop could be rendered as \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\n A(2 : N - 1) := [A(1 : N - 2) + A(2 : N - 1) + A(3 : N)] / 3;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nBut whether that would be rendered in the style of the for-loop or the for all-loop or something else may not be clearly described in the compiler manual.\n\n===Compound for-loops===\nIntroduced with [[ALGOL 68]] and followed by [[PL/I]], this allows the iteration of a loop to be compounded with a test, as in\n for i := 1 : N while A(i) > 0 do ''etc.''\nThat is, a value is assigned to the loop variable ''i'' and only if the ''while expression'' is '''true''' will the loop body be executed. If the result were '''false''' the for-loop's execution stops short. Granted that the loop variable's value ''is'' defined after the termination of the loop, then the above statement will find the first non-positive element in array ''A'' (and if no such, its value will be ''N + 1''), or, with suitable variations, the first non-blank character in a string, and so on.\n\n\n== Loop counters ==\n\nIn [[computer programming]] a '''loop counter''' is the [[variable (programming)|variable]] that controls the iterations of a loop (a computer [[programming language]] construct).  It is so named because most uses of this construct result in the variable taking on a range of integer values in some orderly sequences (example., starting at 0 and end at 10 in increments of 1)\n\nLoop counters change with each [[iteration]] of a loop, providing a unique value for each individual iteration. The loop counter is used to decide when the loop should terminate and for the program flow to continue to the next [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] after the loop.\n\nA common [[identifier naming convention]] is for the loop counter to use the variable names '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' (and so on if needed), where '''i''' would be the most outer loop, '''j''' the next inner loop, etc. The reverse order is also used by some programmers. This style is generally agreed to have originated from the early programming of [[FORTRAN]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, where these variable names beginning with these letters were implicitly declared as having an integer type, and so were obvious choices for loop counters that were only temporarily required. The practice dates back further to [[mathematical notation]] where [[index notation|indices]] for [[summation|sums]] and [[multiplication]]s are often '''i''', '''j''', etc. A variant convention is the use of reduplicated letters for the index, '''ii''', '''jj''', and '''kk''', as this allows easier searching and search-replacing than using a single letter.<ref>http://www.knosof.co.uk/vulnerabilities/loopcntrl.pdf Analysis of loop control variables in C</ref>\n\n===Example===\nAn example of [[C (programming language)|C]] code involving nested for loops, where the loop counter variables are '''i''' and '''j''':\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n    for (j = i; j < 10; j++) {\n        some_function(i, j);\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt has been shown that a nested for loop, as in above example, performs more computations per unit time than a loop without it. This machine-independent optimisation means the nested for loop will finish faster, given the same number of computations to perform. This is an advantage nested for loop has over nested while loop, which behaves differently.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1515/comp-2018-0004 Inner loop program construct: A faster way for program execution]</ref>\n\nFor loops in C can also be used to print the reverse of a word. As:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (i = 0; i < 6; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%c\", &a[i]);\n}\nfor (i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {\n    printf(\"%c\", a[i]);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHere, if the input is {{code|apple}}, the output will be {{code|elppa}}.\n\n==Additional semantics and constructs==\n\n===Use as infinite loops===\nThis C-style for-loop is commonly the source of an [[infinite loop]] since the fundamental steps of iteration are completely in the control of the programmer. In fact, when infinite loops are intended, this type of for-loop can be used (with empty expressions), such as:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (;;)\n    //loop body\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis style is used instead of infinite {{code|while (1)}} loops to avoid a type conversion warning in some C/C++ compilers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Compiler Warning (level 4) C4127 |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t66728h.aspx |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> Some programmers prefer the more succinct {{code|for (;;)}} form over the semantically equivalent but more verbose {{code|while (true)}} form.\n\n===Early exit and continuation===\nSome languages may also provide other supporting statements, which when present can alter how the for-loop iteration proceeds.\nCommon among these are the [[break statement|break]] and [[Control flow#Continuation with next iteration|continue]] statements found in C and its derivatives.\nThe break statement causes the inner-most loop to be terminated immediately when executed.\nThe continue statement will move at once to the next iteration without further progress through the loop body for the current iteration.\nA for statement also terminates when a break, goto, or return statement within the statement body is executed. [Wells]\nOther languages may have similar statements or otherwise provide means to alter the for-loop progress; for example in FORTRAN 95:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nDO I = 1, N\n  statements               !Executed for all values of \"I\", up to a disaster if any.\n  IF (no good) CYCLE       !Skip this value of \"I\", continue with the next.\n  statements               !Executed only where goodness prevails.\n  IF (disaster) EXIT       !Abandon the loop.\n  statements               !While good and, no disaster.\nEND DO                     !Should align with the \"DO\".\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nSome languages offer further facilities such as naming the various loop statements so that with multiple nested loops there is no doubt as to which loop is involved. Fortran 95, for example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nX1:DO I = 1,N\n     statements\n  X2:DO J = 1,M\n       statements\n       IF (trouble) CYCLE X1\n       statements\n     END DO X2\n     statements\n   END DO X1\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThus, when \"trouble\" is detected in the inner loop, the CYCLE X1 (not X2) means that the skip will be to the next iteration for I, ''not'' J. The compiler will also be checking that each END DO has the appropriate label for its position: this is not just a documentation aid. The programmer must still code the problem correctly, but some possible blunders will be blocked.\n\n===Loop variable scope and semantics===\nDifferent languages specify different rules for what value the loop variable will hold on termination of its loop, and indeed some hold that it \"becomes undefined\". This permits a [[compiler]] to generate code that leaves any value in the loop variable, or perhaps even leaves it unchanged because the loop value was held in a register and never stored to memory. Actual behaviour may even vary according to the compiler's optimization settings, as with the Honywell Fortran66 compiler.\n\nIn some languages (not [[C (language)|C]] or [[C++]]) the loop variable is [[Immutable object|immutable]] within the scope of the loop body, with any attempt to modify its value being regarded as a semantic error. Such modifications are sometimes a consequence of a programmer error, which can be very difficult to identify once made. However, only overt changes are likely to be detected by the compiler. Situations where the address of the loop variable is passed as an argument to a [[subroutine]] make it very difficult to check, because the routine's behavior is in general unknowable to the compiler. Some examples in the style of Fortran:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\nDO I = 1, N\n  I = 7                           !Overt adjustment of the loop variable. Compiler complaint likely.\n  Z = ADJUST(I)                   !Function \"ADJUST\" might alter \"I\", to uncertain effect.\n  normal statements               !Memory might fade that \"I\" is the loop variable.\n  PRINT (A(I), B(I), I = 1, N, 2) !Implicit for-loop to print odd elements of arrays A and B, reusing \"I\"...\n  PRINT I                         !What value will be presented?\nEND DO                            !How many times will the loop be executed?\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA common approach is to calculate the iteration count at the start of a loop (with careful attention to overflow as in {{code|for i := 0 : 65535 do ... ;}} in sixteen-bit integer arithmetic) and with each iteration decrement this count while also adjusting the value of {{code|I}}: double counting results. However, adjustments to the value of {{code|I}} within the loop will not change the number of iterations executed.\n\nStill another possibility is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value may or may not be copied to {{code|I}} on each iteration. Again, modifications of {{code|I}} would not affect the control of the loop, but now a disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of {{code|I}} might be to the (possibly altered) current value of {{code|I}} or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element {{code|I}} of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), but if {{code|I}} is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a ''print''-statement to reveal its value), it would likely be a reference to the proper variable {{code|I}} instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities.\n\n====Adjustment of bounds====\nJust as the index variable might be modified within a for-loop, so also may its bounds and direction. But to uncertain effect. A compiler may prevent such attempts, they may have no effect, or they might even work properly - though many would declare that to do so would be wrong. Consider a statement such as \n '''for''' i := first : last : step '''do'''\n   A(i) := A(i) / A(last);\nIf the approach to compiling such a loop was to be the evaluation of ''first'', ''last'' and ''step'' and the calculation of an iteration count via something like ''(last - first)/step'' once only at the start, then if those items were simple variables and their values were somehow adjusted during the iterations, this would have no effect on the iteration count even if the element selected for division by ''A(last)'' changed.\n\n===List of value ranges===\nPL/I and Algol 68, allows loops in which the loop variable is iterated over a list of ranges of values instead of a single range. The following PL/I example will execute the loop with six values of i: 1, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15:\n<pre>\ndo i = 1, 7, 12 to 15;\n  /*statements*/\nend;\n</pre>\n\n== Equivalence with while-loops ==\n===In theory===\nA for-loop can be converted into an equivalent while-loop by incrementing a counter variable directly. The following [[pseudocode]] illustrates this technique:\n\n factorial := 1\n  for counter from 1 to 5\n      factorial := factorial * counter\n\nis easily translated into the following while-loop:\n\n factorial := 1\n  counter := 1\n  while counter <= 5\n     factorial := factorial * counter\n     counter := counter + 1\n\nThis translation is slightly complicated by languages which allow a statement to jump to the next iteration of the loop (such as the \"continue\" statement in C). These statements will typically implicitly increment the counter of a for-loop, but not the equivalent while-loop (since in the latter case the counter is not an integral part of the loop construct). Any translation will have to place all such statements within a block that increments the explicit counter before running the statement.\n\n=== In practice ===\nThe formal equivalence applies only in so far as computer arithmetic also follows the axia of mathematics, in particular that x + 1 > x. Actual computer arithmetic suffers from the overflow of limited representations so that for example in sixteen-bit unsigned arithmetic, 65535 + 1 comes out as zero, because 65536 cannot be represented in unsigned sixteen-bit. Similar problems arise for other sizes, signed or unsigned, and for [[Saturation arithmetic|saturated arithmetic]] where 65535 + 1 would produce 65535. Compiler writers will handle the likes of {{code|for counter := 0 to 65535 do ... next counter}}, possibly by producing code that inspects the state of a hardware \"overflow\" indicator, but unless there is some provision for the equivalent checking after calculating {{code|counter := counter + 1;}} the while-loop equivalence will fail because the counter will never exceed 65535 and so the loop will never end - unless some other mishap occurs.\n\n== Timeline of the ''for-loop'' syntax in various programming languages ==\nGiven an action that must be repeated, for instance, five times, different languages' for-loops will be written differently. The syntax for a three-expression for-loop is nearly identical in all languages that have it, after accounting for different styles of block termination and so on.\n\n===1957: FORTRAN===\nFortran's equivalent of the {{code|for}} loop is the {{code|DO}} loop, \nusing the keyword do instead of for, \nThe syntax of Fortran's {{code|DO}} loop is:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\n        DO label counter = first, last, step\n          statements\nlabel     statement\n</syntaxhighlight> \nThe following two examples behave equivalently to the three argument for-loop in other languages, \ninitializing the counter variable to 1, incrementing by 1 each iteration of the loop and stopping at five (inclusive).\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\n        DO 9, COUNTER = 1, 5, 1\n          WRITE (6,8) COUNTER\n    8     FORMAT( I2 )\n    9   CONTINUE\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIn Fortran 77 (or later), this may also be written as: \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\ndo counter = 1, 5\n  write(*, '(i2)') counter\nend do\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe step part may be omitted if the step is one. Example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortranfixed\">\n* DO loop example.\n       PROGRAM MAIN\n         SUM SQ = 0\n         DO 199 I = 1, 9999999\n           IF (SUM SQ.GT.1000) GO TO 200\n199        SUM SQ = SUM SQ + I**2\n200      PRINT 206, SUMSQ\n206      FORMAT( I2 )\n       END\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSpaces are irrelevant in fixed-form Fortran statements, thus {{code|SUM SQ}} is the same as {{code|SUMSQ}}.  In the modern free-form Fortran style, blanks are significant.\n\nIn Fortran 90, the {{code|GO TO}} may be avoided by using an {{code|EXIT}} statement.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fortran\">\n* DO loop example.\n       program main\n         implicit none\n\n         integer :: sumsq\n         integer :: i\n\n         sumsq = 0\n         do i = 1, 9999999\n           if (sumsq > 1000.0) exit\n           sumsq = sumsq + i**2\n          end do\n         print *, sumsq\n\n       end program\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1958: Algol===\n[[ALGOL|Algol]] was first formalised in the Algol58 report.\n\n===1960: COBOL===\nCOBOL was formalized in late 1959 and has had many elaborations. It uses the PERFORM verb which has many options, with the later addition of \"structured\" statements such as END-PERFORM. Ignoring the need for declaring and initialising variables, the equivalent of a ''for''-loop would be\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n      PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 1000\n             ADD I**2 TO SUM-SQ.\n      END-PERFORM\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIf the PERFORM verb has the optional clause TEST AFTER, the resulting loop is slightly different: the loop body is executed at least once, before any test.\n\n===1964: BASIC===\nLoops in [[BASIC]] are sometimes called for-next loops.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"basic\">\n10 REM THIS FOR LOOP PRINTS ODD NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 15\n20 FOR I = 1 TO 15 STEP 2\n30 PRINT I\n40 NEXT I\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNotice that the end-loop marker specifies the name of the index variable, which must correspond to the name of the index variable in the start of the for-loop. Some languages (PL/I, FORTRAN 95 and later) allow a statement label on the start of a for-loop that can be matched by the compiler against the same text on the corresponding end-loop statement. Fortran also allows the {{code|EXIT}} and {{code|CYCLE}} statements to name this text; in a nest of loops this makes clear which loop is intended. However, in these languages the labels must be unique, so successive loops involving the same index variable cannot use the same text nor can a label be the same as the name of a variable, such as the index variable for the loop.\n\n===1964: PL/I===\n<source lang=\"rexx\">\ndo counter = 1 to 5 by 1; /* \"by 1\" is the default if not specified */\n  /*statements*/;\n  end;\n</source>\n\nThe {{mono|LEAVE}} statement may be used to exit the loop. Loops can be labeled, and ''leave'' may leave a specific labeled loop in a group of nested loops. Some PL/I dialects include the {{mono|ITERATE}} statement to terminate the current loop iteration and begin the next.\n\n===1968: Algol 68===\n[[Algol68]] has what was considered ''the'' universal loop, the full syntax is:\n<pre>\nFOR i FROM 1 BY 2 TO 3 WHILE i\u22604 DO ~ OD\n</pre>\n\nFurther, the single iteration range could be replaced by a list of such ranges. There are several unusual aspects of the construct\n* only the {{code|do ~ od}} portion was compulsory, in which case the loop will iterate indefinitely.\n* thus the clause {{code|to 100 do ~ od}}, will iterate exactly 100 times.\n* the {{code|while}} ''syntactic element'' allowed a programmer to break from a {{code|for}} loop early, as in:\n<pre>\nINT sum sq := 0;\nFOR i\n WHILE\n  print((\"So far:\", i, new line)); # Interposed for tracing purposes. #\n  sum sq \u2260 70\u21912                    # This is the test for the WHILE   #\nDO\n  sum sq +:= i\u21912\nOD\n</pre>\n\nSubsequent ''extensions'' to the standard Algol68 allowed the {{code|to}} syntactic element to be replaced with {{code|{{sic|hide=y|up|to}}}} and {{code|downto}} to achieve a small optimization. The same compilers also incorporated:\n;{{code|until}}: for late loop termination.\n;{{code|foreach}}: for working on arrays in [[parallel computing|parallel]].\n\n===1970: Pascal===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\">\nfor Counter := 1 to 5 do\n  (*statement*);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nDecrementing (counting backwards) is using {{code|downto}} keyword instead of {{code|to}}, as in:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"pascal\">\nfor Counter := 5 downto 1 do\n  (*statement*);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe numeric-range for-loop varies somewhat more.\n\n===1972: C/C++===\n{{further|C syntax#Iteration statements}}\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nfor (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)\n    statement\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe <tt>statement</tt> is often a block statement; an example of this would be:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n//Using for-loops to add numbers 1 - 5\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < 6; ++i) {\n    sum += i;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe ISO/IEC 9899:1999 publication (commonly known as [[C99]]) also allows initial declarations in {{code|for}} loops. All the three sections in the for loop are optional.\n\n===1972: Smalltalk===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"smalltalk\">1 to: 5 do: [ :counter | \"statements\" ]</syntaxhighlight>\nContrary to other languages, in [[Smalltalk]] a for-loop is not a [[language construct]] but defined in the class Number as a method with two parameters, the end value and a [[Closure (computer science)|closure]], using self as start value.\n\n===1980: Ada===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nfor Counter in 1 .. 5 loop\n   -- statements\nend loop;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe ''exit'' statement may be used to exit the loop. Loops can be labeled, and ''exit'' may leave a specifically labeled loop in a group of nested loops:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nCounting:\n    for Counter in 1 .. 5 loop\n   Triangle:\n       for Secondary_Index in 2 .. Counter loop\n          -- statements\n          exit Counting;\n          -- statements\n       end loop Triangle;\n    end loop Counting;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1980: Maple===\n\nMaple has two forms of for-loop, one for iterating of a range of values, and the other for iterating over the contents of a container. The value range form is as follows:\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' ''f'' '''by''' ''b'' '''to''' ''t'' '''while''' ''w'' '''do'''\n     ''# loop body''\n '''od''';\n\nAll parts except <code>'''do'''</code> and <code>'''od'''</code> are optional. The <code>'''for''' ''i''</code> part, if present, must come first. The remaining parts (<code>'''from''' ''f''</code>, <code>'''by''' ''b''</code>, <code>'''to''' ''t''</code>, <code>'''while''' ''w''</code>) can appear in any order.\n\nIterating over a container is done using this form of loop:\n\n '''for''' ''e'' '''in''' ''c'' '''while''' ''w'' '''do'''\n     ''# loop body''\n '''od''';\n\nThe <code>'''in''' ''c''</code> clause specifies the container, which may be a list, set, sum, product, unevaluated function, array, or an object implementing an iterator.\n\nA for-loop may be terminated by <code>'''od'''</code>, <code>'''end'''</code>, or <code>'''end do'''</code>.\n\n===1982: Maxima CAS===\nIn [[Maxima CAS]] one can use also non integer values : \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Text\">\nfor x:0.5 step 0.1 thru 0.9 do\n    /* \"Do something with x\" */\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1982: PostScript===\nThe for-loop, written as {{code|[initial] [increment] [limit] { ... } for}} initialises an internal variable, executes the body as long as the internal variable is not more than limit (or not less, if increment is negative) and, at the end of each iteration, increments the internal variable. Before each iteration, the value of the internal variable is pushed onto the stack.<ref>{{cite book|title=PostScript Language Reference|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|page=596|isbn=0-201-37922-8}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"applescript\">\n1 1 6 {STATEMENTS} for\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThere is also a simple repeat-loop.\nThe repeat-loop, written as {{code|X { ... } repeat}}, repeats the body exactly X times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pscript.dubmun.com/tutorial4.html|title=PostScript Tutorial - Loops}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"applescript\">\n5 { STATEMENTS } repeat\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1983: Ada 83 and above===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nprocedure Main is\n  Sum_Sq : Integer := 0;\nbegin\n  for I in 1 .. 9999999 loop \n    if Sum_Sq <= 1000 then\n      Sum_Sq := Sum_Sq + I**2\n    end if;\n  end loop;\nend;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1984: MATLAB===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"matlab\">\nfor n = 1:5 \n     -- statements\nend</syntaxhighlight>\nAs {{code|i}} is used for the [[Imaginary unit]], its use as a loop variable is discouraged.\n\n===1987: Perl===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"perl\">\nfor ($counter = 1; $counter <= 5; $counter++) { # implicitly or predefined variable\n    # statements;\n}\nfor (my $counter = 1; $counter <= 5; $counter++) { # variable private to the loop\n    # statements;\n}\nfor (1..5) { # variable implicitly called $_; 1..5 creates a list of these 5 elements\n    # statements;\n}\nstatement for 1..5; # almost same (only 1 statement) with natural language order\nfor my $counter (1..5) { # variable private to the loop\n    # statements;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n(Note that \"[[there's more than one way to do it]]\" is a Perl programming motto.)\n\n===1988: Mathematica===\n\nThe construct corresponding to most other languages' for-loop is called Do in Mathematica\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ruby\">\nDo[f[x], {x, 0, 1, 0.1}]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nMathematica also has a For construct that mimics the for-loop of C-like languages\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ruby\">\nFor[x= 0 , x <= 1, x += 0.1,\n    f[x]\n]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1989: Bash===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n# first form\nfor i in 1 2 3 4 5\ndo\n    # must have at least one command in loop\n    echo $i  # just print value of i\ndone\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n# second form\nfor (( i = 1; i <= 5; i++ ))\ndo\n    # must have at least one command in loop\n    echo $i  # just print value of i\ndone\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNote that an empty loop (i.e., one with no commands between {{code|do}} and {{code|done}}) is a syntax error. If the above loops contained only comments, execution would result in the message \"syntax error near unexpected token 'done'\".\n\n===1990: Haskell===\nThe built-in imperative ''forM_'' maps a [[monad (functional programming)|monadic]] expression into a list, as \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nforM_ [1..5] $ \\indx -> do statements\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nor get each iteration result as a list in\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nstatements_result_list <- forM [1..5] $ \\indx -> do statements\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBut, if you want to save the space of the [1..5] list,\na more authentic [[monad (functional programming)|monadic]] ''forLoop_'' construction can be defined as\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nimport Control.Monad as M\n\nforLoopM_ :: Monad m => a -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> (a -> m ()) -> m ()\nforLoopM_ indx prop incr f = do\n        f indx\n        M.when (prop next) $ forLoopM_ next prop incr f\n  where      \n    next = incr indx    \n</syntaxhighlight>\nand used as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\n  forLoopM_ (0::Int) (< len) (+1) $ \\indx -> do -- whatever with the index\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===1991: Oberon-2, Oberon-07, or Component Pascal===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"modula2\">\nFOR Counter := 1 TO 5 DO\n  (* statement sequence *)\nEND\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNote that in the original Oberon language the for-loop was omitted in favor of the more general Oberon loop construct.
