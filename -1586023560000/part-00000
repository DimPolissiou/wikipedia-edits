{"title_page": "Copper in health", "text_new": "[[Image:Copper metabolism.png|thumb|Normal absorption and distribution of copper. Cu = copper, CP = [[ceruloplasmin]], green = ATP7B carrying copper.]]\n[[Copper]] is an essential [[trace element]] that is vital to the health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]]). In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport.\n\nCopper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing. Copper also helps to neutralize \"[[free-radical]]s\", which can cause severe damage to cells.\n\nCopper's essentiality was first discovered in 1928, when it was demonstrated that rats fed a copper-deficient milk diet were unable to produce sufficient red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hart |first1=E.

J. 2001. Copper metabolism and requirements in the pregnant mother, her fetus, and children. New York: International Copper Association{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its [[liver]] during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-10_12|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

The majority of blood copper (or serum copper) is bound to ceruloplasmin. The proportion of ceruloplasmin-bound copper can range from 70-95% and differs between individuals, depending, for example, on hormonal cycle, season, and copper status.

ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis.

In developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake is also likely to be adequate.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAs a natural element in the earth's crust, copper exists in most of the world's surface water and groundwater, although the actual concentration of copper in natural waters varies geographically. Drinking water can comprise 20-25% of dietary copper.<ref name=\"Stern\">{{cite book |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |chapter=U-Shaped Dose-Response Curve for Risk Assessment of Essential Trace Elements: Copper as a Case Study |pages=555\u201362 |editor1-first=Mark G. |editor1-last=Robson |editor2-first=William A. |editor2-last=Toscano |year=2007 |title=Risk Assessment for Environmental Health |location=San Francisco |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-1-118-42406-3}}</ref>\n\nIn many regions of the world, copper tubing that conveys drinking water can be a source of dietary copper. Copper tube can leach a small amount of copper, particularly in its first year or two of service. Afterwards, a protective surface usually forms on the inside of copper tubes that retards leaching.\n\nIn [[France]] and some other countries, copper bowls are traditionally used for whipping [[egg white]], as the copper helps stabilise bonds in the white as it is beaten and whipped.

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion. These symptoms abate when the high copper food source is no longer ingested.\n\nIn 1996, the International Program on Chemical Safety, a World Health Organization-associated agency, stated \"there is greater risk of health effects from deficiency of copper intake than from excess copper intake.\" This conclusion was confirmed in recent multi-route exposure surveys.<ref name=\"Steven S 2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Georgopoulos |first1=Panos G |last2=Wang |first2=Sheng Wei |last3=Georgopoulos |first3=Ioannis G |last4=Yonone-Lioy |first4=Mary Jean |last5=Lioy |first5=Paul J |title=Assessment of human exposure to copper: A case study using the NHEXAS database |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397\u2013409 |year=2006 |pmid=16249795 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500462 }}</ref>\n\nThe health conditions of non-genetic copper deficiency and copper excess are described below.\n\n===Copper deficiency===\nThere are conflicting reports on the extent of deficiency in the U.S. One review indicates approximately 25% of adolescents, adults, and people over 65, do not meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for copper.<ref name=pmid17454552/> Another source states less common: a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 1.11 and 1.54&nbsp;mg/day, respectively.

In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport.\n\nCopper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing.

New York: International Copper Association{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its [[liver]] during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-10_12|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

Nuts, including [[peanut]]s and [[pecan]]s, are especially rich in copper, as are grains such as [[wheat]] and [[rye]], and several fruits including [[lemon]]s and [[raisin]]s. Other food sources that contain copper include [[cereal]]s, [[potato]]es, [[pea]]s, [[red meat]], [[mushroom]]s, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as [[kale]]), and fruits ([[coconut]]s, [[papaya]] and [[apple]]s). [[Tea]], [[rice]] and [[chicken]] are relatively low in copper, but can provide a reasonable amount of copper when they are consumed in significant amounts.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nEating a balanced diet with a range of foods from different food groups is the best way to avoid copper deficiency. In both developed and developing countries, adults, young children, and adolescents who consume diets of grain, [[millet]], [[tuber]], or rice along with legumes (beans) or small amounts of fish or meat, some fruits and vegetables, and some vegetable oil are likely to obtain adequate copper if their total food consumption is adequate in calories. In developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake is also likely to be adequate.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAs a natural element in the earth's crust, copper exists in most of the world's surface water and groundwater, although the actual concentration of copper in natural waters varies geographically. Drinking water can comprise 20-25% of dietary copper.<ref name=\"Stern\">{{cite book |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |chapter=U-Shaped Dose-Response Curve for Risk Assessment of Essential Trace Elements: Copper as a Case Study |pages=555\u201362 |editor1-first=Mark G. |editor1-last=Robson |editor2-first=William A. |editor2-last=Toscano |year=2007 |title=Risk Assessment for Environmental Health |location=San Francisco |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-1-118-42406-3}}</ref>\n\nIn many regions of the world, copper tubing that conveys drinking water can be a source of dietary copper.

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion. These symptoms abate when the high copper food source is no longer ingested.\n\nIn 1996, the International Program on Chemical Safety, a World Health Organization-associated agency, stated \"there is greater risk of health effects from deficiency of copper intake than from excess copper intake.\" This conclusion was confirmed in recent multi-route exposure surveys.<ref name=\"Steven S 2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Georgopoulos |first1=Panos G |last2=Wang |first2=Sheng Wei |last3=Georgopoulos |first3=Ioannis G |last4=Yonone-Lioy |first4=Mary Jean |last5=Lioy |first5=Paul J |title=Assessment of human exposure to copper: A case study using the NHEXAS database |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397\u2013409 |year=2006 |pmid=16249795 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500462 }}</ref>\n\nThe health conditions of non-genetic copper deficiency and copper excess are described below.\n\n===Copper deficiency===\nThere are conflicting reports on the extent of deficiency in the U.S. One review indicates approximately 25% of adolescents, adults, and people over 65, do not meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for copper.<ref name=pmid17454552/> Another source states less common: a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 1.11 and 1.54&nbsp;mg/day, respectively.

Much attention has focused on the potential consequences of copper toxicity in normal and potentially susceptible populations. Potentially susceptible subpopulations include [[hemodialysis]] patients and individuals with chronic liver disease. Recently, concern was expressed about the potential sensitivity to liver disease of individuals who are [[heterozygote]] carriers of Wilson disease genetic defects (i.e., those having one normal and one mutated Wilson copper ATPase gene) but who do not have the disease (which requires defects in both relevant genes).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=George J. |title=Editorial: Is heterozygosity for a Wilson's disease gene defect an important underlying cause of infantile and childhood copper toxicosis syndromes? |journal=The Journal of Trace Elements in Experimental Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2000 |pages=249\u201354 |doi=10.1002/1520-670X(2000)13:3<249::AID-JTRA1>3.0.CO;2-L |hdl=2027.42/35050 }}</ref> However, to date, no data are available that either support or refute this hypothesis.\n\n===Acute exposures===\nIn case reports of humans intentionally or accidentally ingesting high concentrations of copper salts (doses usually not known but reported to be 20\u201370&nbsp;grams of copper), a progression of symptoms was observed including abdominal pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea, [[tachycardia]], respiratory difficulty, [[hemolytic anemia]], [[hematuria]], massive gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, and death.\n\nEpisodes of acute gastrointestinal upset following single or repeated ingestion of drinking water containing elevated levels of copper (generally above 3\u20136&nbsp;mg/L) are characterized by nausea, vomiting, and stomach irritation. These symptoms resolve when copper in the drinking water source is reduced.\n\nThree experimental studies were conducted that demonstrate a threshold for acute gastrointestinal upset of approximately

The most reliable indicator of excess copper status is liver copper concentration. However, measurement of this endpoint in humans is intrusive and not generally conducted except in cases of suspected copper poisoning. Increased serum copper or ceruolplasmin levels are not reliably associated with copper toxicity as elevations in concentrations can be induced by inflammation, infection, disease, malignancies, pregnancy, and other biological stressors. Levels of copper-containing enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and diaminase oxidase, vary not only in response to copper state but also in response to a variety of other physiological and biochemical factors and therefore are inconsistent markers of excess copper status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=David B |title=Copper intake and assessment of copper status |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=67 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=1041S\u20131045S |year=1998 |pmid=9587149 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/67.5.1041S }}</ref>\n\nA new candidate biomarker for copper excess as well as deficiency has emerged in recent years.

In many areas, soils have insufficient levels of copper. Soils that are naturally deficient in copper often require copper supplements before agricultural crops, such as cereals, can be grown.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nCopper deficiencies in soil can lead to crop failure. Copper deficiency is a major issue in global food production, resulting in losses in yield and reduced quality of output. Nitrogen fertilizers can worsen copper deficiency in agricultural soils.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe world's two most important food crops, [[rice]] and [[wheat]], are highly susceptible to copper deficiency. So are several other important foods, including [[citrus]], [[oats]], [[spinach]] and [[carrot]]s. On the other hand, some foods including [[coconut]]s, [[soybean]]s and [[asparagus]], are not particularly sensitive to copper-deficient soils.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe most effective strategy to counter copper deficiency is to supplement the soil with copper, usually in the form of copper sulfate. [[Sewage sludge]] is also used in some areas to replenish agricultural land with organics and trace metals, including copper.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Animal health===\nIn livestock, [[cattle]] and [[sheep]] commonly show indications when they are copper deficient.

The Agynykatty River washed out a gorge in the mountain range changing its direction. The river bottom fills not completely with water. In areas where the river used to flow, the dry bottom occupies by the forest that grew on this place. \n\n== Location ==\nThere are the city of [[Sarkand]], the villages of Pokatilovka and Topolevka and the Zhalanash cordon on the territory of the tract. The territory is part of the natural Dzhongar-Alatau National Park. The tract is under the protection of the huntsmen of the Zhalanash cordon.\n\n== Description==\nThere is access to the Zhasyklok Lake from the Agynykatty gorge. The lake is a part of the natural park. Rock slabs are located in the area of Topolevka village. One of these slabs descends into a small river. A forest occupies part of the bank river, which originates at an altitude of 1200 m above sea level. \n\nFir, spruce, aspen, birch and poplar grow here. In some places can be seen the famous [[Apple tree|Sievers apple tree]], which is the ancestor of all cultivated varieties of apple trees.

The Agynykatty River washed out a gorge in the mountain range changing its direction. The river bottom fills not completely with water. In areas where the river used to flow, the dry bottom occupies by the forest that grew on this place. \n\n== Location ==\nThere are the city of [[Sarkand]], the villages of Pokatilovka and Topolevka and the Zhalanash cordon on the territory of the tract. The territory is part of the natural Dzhongar-Alatau National Park. The tract is under the protection of the huntsmen of the Zhalanash cordon.\n\n== Description==\nThere is access to the Zhasyklok Lake from the Agynykatty gorge. The lake is a part of the natural park. Rock slabs are located in the area of Topolevka village. One of these slabs descends into a small river. A forest occupies part of the bank river, which originates at an altitude of 1200 m above sea level. \n\nFir, spruce, aspen, birch and poplar grow here. In some places can be seen the famous [[Apple tree|Sievers apple tree]], which is the ancestor of all cultivated varieties of apple trees.

In spite of being assigned to its own genus in 1875, its affinities were a source of contention.<ref name = \"Webster\"/> The shape of the basihyal bone in the skull, and aspects of its behaviour led to the suggestion that it was instead an [[Old World warbler]] in the family Sylviidae. That it was not in the family Parulidae was supported by the arrangement of muscles in the legs. [[DNA\u2013DNA hybridization]] placed the olive warbler as an early branch of the [[finch]] clade (which included the finches, cardinals and [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s) and the New World sparrow clade (which includes the [[tanager]]s, [[icterid]]s and New world warblers),<ref>{{cite book|last=Sibley|first=C.

It has a [[disjunct distribution]] across the rest of its range, with populations in [[Tamaulipas]], [[Coahuila]] and [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in Mexico, and further south in southwest [[Guatemala]] and from northern [[El Salvador]] and central [[Honduras]] to northern Nicaragua.<ref name = \"BNA\">{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/310|title=Olive Warbler (''Peucedramus taeniatus'')|last=Lowther|first=Peter E|author2=Jorge Nocedal|year=1997|work=Bird of North America Online|publisher=Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology|accessdate=1 May 2009 | doi = 10.2173/bna.310}}</ref>\n\nThe olive warbler is a bird of mountains and highlands.

These forests range from humid to semi-arid.<ref name =\"Webster\"/> In coastal regions stands of palms may be used, and in the [[Valley of Mexico]] pine and alder forests are inhabited.<ref name = \"BNA\"/>\n\nOver most of its range the species is {{birdgloss|resident}}, but there is evidence that the most northerly populations are [[bird migration|partial migrants]]. Birds in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico apparently move away from their breeding grounds, although what exact movements are made is unclear. It has been suggested that they are either \"down slope migrants\", moving to lower elevations, or dispersive, as some records show their presence in [[Texas]]. Birds attributed to the northern race ''P. t. arizonae'' have been recorded near [[Tepic]], in [[Nayarit]].

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi.\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

the [[South Pacific Ocean]] to the east of 160\u00b0E. The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones will be  officially monitored by the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) in [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Nadi, Fiji]] and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in [[Bureau of Meteorology|Brisbane, Australia]] and [[Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited|Wellington, New Zealand]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and TCWC Brisbane all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi.\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

JAL had used several logos up until 1958. When the airline arranged to buy new Douglas DC-8s, it decided to create a new official logo for the inauguration of its jet service worldwide.\n\nIn the creation of the logo, Huff was inspired by the personal crests of Samurai families. In a book he'd been given, ''We Japanese'', he found pages of crests, including the crane. On his choice of the crane, he writes: \"I had faith that it was the perfect symbol for Japan Air Lines.

The Sky Wider Economy seats, found on select 767's and select 777-300s, feature slimmer seats with 4\" more legroom, and another inch of width totaling up to 35\" of seat pitch, and a 19\" width compared to the 31\" pitch and 18\" width of standard economy seats, plus a larger PTV screen of up to 11\".

The Sky Suite is in a staggered 2-3-2 setup that offer direct aisle access to all business class passengers. These can be found on all 13 of JAL's Boeing 777-300ER aircraft (named '''SS7'''), 10 of JAL's 787-8 aircraft (named '''SS8''') and 8 of JAL's 787-9 aircraft (named '''SS9'''). Later in 2015, JAL introduced a new version of Sky Suite, called Sky Suite II, in order to fit lie-flat seats on its new international 767-300ER fleet (named '''SS6'''), in a 1-2-1 setup.

The tournament continued as a one-classification competition through 1929, then as a two-classification (A and B) competition from 1930 through 1932. After the 1932 tournament, the NYSPHSAA voted against continuing the competition.<ref>http://www.nysbasketballbrackets.com. Retrieved April 6, 2015.</ref> According to Alton Doyle, the executive director of the NYSPHSAA from 1975 to 1990, there were many violations of the rules on eligibility, with some schools using overage students, and gambling was widespread. The state tournament was believed to be a cause of such problems, leading to the decision to eliminate the tournament.<ref>Jason Molinet, \"History of LI Basketball/New York State of Mind/Tourney, dormant for years, has become goal for LI teams\", ''[[Newsday]]'', March 21, 2002, http://www.newsday.com/sports/history-of-li-basketball-new-york-state-of-mind-tourney-dormant-for-years-has-become-goal-for-li-teams-1.349674.
