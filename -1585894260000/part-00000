The park is on Grist Mill Road (CR 46) off [[Alabama State Route 76|State Route 76]] about 4 miles (6 kilometers) northeast of the city of [[Childersburg, Alabama|Childersburg]].\n\nBoth structures, dating back to the [[American Civil War]], were restored in 1974 and were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 29, 1976.<ref name=\"nris\"/>  The Childersburg Heritage Committee purchased the tract in 1988, and with help from the [[Alabama Historical Commission]] and the Talladega County Commission, established Kymulga Park.  More structural renovations were made as well.  There is an admission charge to visit the park, with proceeds being used for upkeep of all structures and nature trails within this historic recreation area.\n\nKymulga Park was acquired by the City of Childersburg in June 2011.  It is currently managed by the Childersburg Historic Preservation Commission.\n\n==Kymulga Mill==\nKymulga Mill is a working [[gristmill]] built in 1864 by [[Germany|German]] contractor G.E. Morris for [[Confederate Army]] [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] [[George H. Forney]], who was later promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]].  Forney died at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in [[Virginia]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Lt. Colonel George H.

[[Union Army]] soldiers burned most of the gristmills throughout the area during the Civil War, but Kymulga Mill was missed.  The mill was sold four times before being purchased by the Childersburg Heritage Committee from latest owner Edward Donahoo in 1988, though it remained in active service through many of those years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Dean|title=History of the grist mill and covered bridge|work=Kymulga Grist Mill And Park|url=http://kymulgapark.tripod.com/id16.html|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThree water powered turbines ran the four-story mill, including lights, grain elevator and [[millstone]]s used for grinding grain.  Two of its five sets are French buhrs, thought to be the hardest rock in the world.  Kymulga Mill continues to operate to this day, though under electricity, still making corn meal with its huge millstones.  The building is now a tourist attraction open for guided tours.  It also serves as a gift shop and park office.\n\n==Kymulga Covered Bridge==\nThe Kymulga Covered Bridge is a wood & metal combination style [[covered bridge]] that spans [[Talladega Creek]], located just east of Kymulga Mill within Kymulga Park.  Built in 1861, the 105-foot (32 m) bridge is a [[Howe truss]] construction over a single span.<ref name=\"nomform\">{{cite web|last=Floyd |first=W.

Eventually, farms and communities spawned along the former trail.  The United States government purchased land adjacent to Kymulga Mill in 1941 for the [[Alabama Army Ammunition Plant|Alabama Ordnance Works]], a [[military]] installation.  Settlements within the tract had to be relocated.  Today, the Kymulga Covered Bridge leads park visitors to a series of nature trails north of Talladega Creek.

The park is on Grist Mill Road (CR 46) off [[Alabama State Route 76|State Route 76]] about 4 miles (6 kilometers) northeast of the city of [[Childersburg, Alabama|Childersburg]].\n\nBoth structures, dating back to the [[American Civil War]], were restored in 1974 and were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 29, 1976.<ref name=\"nris\"/>  The Childersburg Heritage Committee purchased the tract in 1988, and with help from the [[Alabama Historical Commission]] and the Talladega County Commission, established Kymulga Park.  More structural renovations were made as well.  There is an admission charge to visit the park, with proceeds being used for upkeep of all structures and nature trails within this historic recreation area.\n\nKymulga Park was acquired by the City of Childersburg in June 2011.  It is currently managed by the Childersburg Historic Preservation Commission.\n\n==Kymulga Mill==\nKymulga Mill is a working [[gristmill]] built in 1864 by [[Germany|German]] contractor G.E. Morris for [[Confederate Army]] [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] [[George H. Forney]], who was later promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]].  Forney died at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in [[Virginia]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Lt. Colonel George H. Forney|url=http://1stconfederatebattalion.org/forney.htm|work=1st Confederate Infantry Battalion, Company A, Forney's Regiment, Tilghman's Brigade: A Living History Association|accessdate=March 10, 2014|date=May 4, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311050932/http://1stconfederatebattalion.org/forney.htm|archive-date=March 11, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> before construction was completed, but his wife allowed Morris to finish it.  [[Union Army]] soldiers burned most of the gristmills throughout the area during the Civil War, but Kymulga Mill was missed.  The mill was sold four times before being purchased by the Childersburg Heritage Committee from latest owner Edward Donahoo in 1988, though it remained in active service through many of those years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Dean|title=History of the grist mill and covered bridge|work=Kymulga Grist Mill And Park|url=http://kymulgapark.tripod.com/id16.html|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThree water powered turbines ran the four-story mill, including lights, grain elevator and [[millstone]]s used for grinding grain.  Two of its five sets are French buhrs, thought to be the hardest rock in the world.  Kymulga Mill continues to operate to this day, though under electricity, still making corn meal with its huge millstones.  The building is now a tourist attraction open for guided tours.  It also serves as a gift shop and park office.\n\n==Kymulga Covered Bridge==\nThe Kymulga Covered Bridge is a wood & metal combination style [[covered bridge]] that spans [[Talladega Creek]], located just east of Kymulga Mill within Kymulga Park.  Built in 1861, the 105-foot (32 m) bridge is a [[Howe truss]] construction over a single span.<ref name=\"nomform\">{{cite web|last=Floyd |first=W.

Eventually, farms and communities spawned along the former trail.  The United States government purchased land adjacent to Kymulga Mill in 1941 for the Alabama Ordnance Works, a [[military]] installation.  Settlements within the tract had to be relocated.  Today, the Kymulga Covered Bridge leads park visitors to a series of nature trails north of Talladega Creek.
