The intended name from the beginning was [[Black Hand (extortion)|\"The Black Hand\"]] ({{lang-sq|Dora e Zez\u00eb}}), in resonance with other secret societies that carried similar name in Europe, but was shifted later for avoiding misunderstandings regarding the society's programme and activity. A correspondence of [[Fan Noli]] to one of the founders, Nikolla Ivanaj, shows Noli's disagreement with these naming convention which sounded to him like [[Black Hand (extortion)|the ''Mano Nera'']]. Despite the efforts of Ivanaj for changing the name to \"National Organization of Albania\" ({{lang-sq|Organizacionit Komb\u00ebtar t\u00eb Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb}}), the name did not change due to objections from the branches.<ref name=\"YlliPress\"/>\n\nThe society had a secret character which conformed with that of the other secret societies throughout the world.
