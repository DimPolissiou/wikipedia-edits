''Battlefield V'' is the sixteenth installment in the ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' series. It was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on November 20, 2018. Those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game were granted early access to the game on November 15, 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/18/complete-guide-to-battlefield-5-preorder-bonuses|title=Complete Guide to Battlefield 5 Preorder Bonuses|last=Macy|first=Seth G.|website=IGN|date=October 18, 2018|access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> and [[Origin Access]] Premium subscribers on PC received access to the game on November 9, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/9/18079060/battlefield-5-ea-subscribers-early-release-date|title=Players who buy Battlefield 5 have to wait the longest to play it|work=Polygon|access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref> The game is based on [[World War II]] and is a thematic continuation of its [[World War I]] based precursor ''[[Battlefield 1]]''.\n\nPre-release reception of the game was mixed, with the announcement trailer causing backlash from some fans of the series for the degree of historical inaccuracy regarding the game's depictions of female soldiers. Upon release, ''Battlefield V'' received generally favourable reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay but criticized for its shortage of content at launch and lack of innovation. The game sold 7.3 million copies by the end of 2018 but was a commercial disappointment for Electronic Arts. \n\nOn April 23 2020 it was announced that live service for the game would continue until summer of 2020, when the game would receive its last major update.<ref>{{cite web |title=An update on the future of Battlefield V |url=https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1253307936962678784 |website=Twitter |publisher=Battlefield |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Correct, and we'll have more details about what's included in the summer update closer to that time. |url=https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1253314285201051649 |website=Twitter |publisher=Battlefield |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Battlefield V'' is focused extensively on party-based features and mechanics, scarcity of resources, and removing \"abstractions\" from game mechanics to increase realism.<ref name=\"vergereturn\" /> There is an expanded focus on player customization through the new [[Company (military unit)|Company]] system, where players can create multiple characters with cosmetic and weapon options. Cosmetic items, and currency used to purchase others, are earned by completing in-game objectives.<ref name=\"vergereturn\" /><ref name=\"polygoncustom\">{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17385040/battlefield-5-character-customization-items|last=Gilliam|first=Ryan|date=May 23, 2018|title=Players can customize every aspect of their characters in Battlefield 5|work=Polygon|access-date=May 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530130700/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17385040/battlefield-5-character-customization-items|archive-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"polygon-nopass\" />\n\nThe game features several new multiplayer modes, including the \"continuous\" campaign mode \"[[Battle royale game|Firestorm]]\", and \"Grand Operations\". The Grand Operations mode is an expansion of the \"Operations\" mode introduced in ''Battlefield 1'', which focuses on matches taking place across multiple stages to simulate a campaign from the war. In Grand Operations, each round will have specific objectives, and performance in each stage will influence the next. If the final day ends with a close margin of victory, the match will culminate with a \"Final Stand,\" with players fighting to the last man standing on a continually shrinking map. Similarly to ''Battlefield 1'', the game features a collection of single-player \"war stories\" based on aspects of World War II.<ref name=\"vergereturn\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|last=Savov|first=Vlad|title=Battlefield V returns to World War II this October|work=The Verge|date=May 23, 2018|access-date=May 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530130250/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|archive-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> The game also features a [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode not seen since ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' called \"Combined Arms,\" where up to four players can undertake missions together and features dynamic missions and objectives so missions cannot be played the same way each time.\n\nThe [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] mode is built around the franchise's \"core pillars of destruction, team play, and vehicles.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-09-battlefield-v-is-getting-a-battle-royale-mode-called-royale|title=Battlefield V is getting a battle royale mode called Royale|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=June 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-3231890|last=|first=|title=Battlefield 5: EA announces Battle Royale mode at E3 2018|work=TrustedReviews|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-battlefield-5-battle-royale-mode-announced/1100-6459536/|last=|first=|title=E3 2018: Battlefield 5 Battle Royale Mode Announced By EA|work=GameSpot|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> The name \"Firestorm\" refers to a literal storm of fire that constricts players similar to the popular Battle Royale game mechanic of restricting the play area. Furthermore, this particular game mode was not developed by EA DICE themselves, but has been outsourced to [[Criterion Games]] and features the biggest map created by the franchise to date. It is playable by 64 players, which can be divided into up to 16 squads with a focus on team work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-07-burnout-creator-criterion-making-battlefield-5s-battle-royale-mode|title=Criterion making Battlefield 5's battle royale mode|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs in ''Battlefield 1'', the single-player campaign is divided into an introduction followed by episodic ''War Stories,'' three of which were available at launch: ''\"Nordlys\"'' takes place from the point-of-view of a [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] fighter taking part in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|sabotage of the German nuclear program]], ''\"Tirailleur\"'' tells the story of a [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese Tirailleur]] during [[Operation Dragoon]], and ''\"Under No Flag\"'' puts the player in the shoes of Billy Bridger, a convicted bank robber and explosives expert conscripted into the [[Special Boat Service]] to take part in [[Operation Albumen]]. The fourth campaign, ''\"The Last Tiger,\"'' was released on December 5, 2018, which depicts the struggles of a German [[Tiger I]] tank crew during the [[Ruhr Pocket]] in the closing days of the war.\n\n=== My Country Calling ===\nThe introductory episode of Battlefield V, titled \u201cMy Country Calling\u201d or \u201cPrologue\u201d, is a tutorial required upon first launching up the game. In it, the player learns the basic mechanics on how infantry, tanks, and planes, as well as setting the tone for future war stories. The prologue begins after Battlefield 1's \u201cStorm of Steel\u201d left off, before cutting to a black screen with white text, commentating on how society was quick to forget the horrors of the First World War. The prologue then jumps forward to London 1939, with Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war on Germany being played on the radio. The narration then begins before the player steps into the shoes of a British paratrooper, during a night raid at Narvik Docks, 1940. The player then must defeat several German soldiers before a Tiger I tank appears, and the screen fades to white. The player is then placed into control of tank commander Peter Muller, the main character of the \u201cLast Tiger\u201d war story. In this instance, however, the player is tasked with breaking British lines at Tobruk, before an artillery strike causes another character change. After the transition, the player is then put in control of a free French sniper, presumed to be one of the same soldiers as the \u201cTirailleur\u201d war story, around the Kasserine Pass. After sniping several enemies during an ambush sequence, the player character is then killed when a strafing run hits them. The camera then pans to a Bf 109 pilot titled Yellow-Seven. This time, the player must shoot down a variety of Blenheim and Spitfire aircraft, before being shot down themselves. Finally, the player takes the role of a British machine gunner during the Final Defense at Nijmegen Bridge, 1944. A V1 flying bomb soon detonates on their position, however, and the player goes into a last stand before getting killed in the onslaught of gunfire. Upon completion of all introductory segments, the player is then shown cinematic clips of the war stories, before being treated to the game's title card.\n\n=== Under No Flag ===\nIn the spring of 1942, convicted bank robber William Sidney \"Billy\" Bridger, the son of another infamous bank robber, Arthur Bridger, volunteers to join the British military in order to avoid jail time, and is assigned as a demolitions expert to a Special Boat Service team led by George Mason ([[Craig Fairbrass]]). Billy and Mason infiltrate occupied North Africa in order to sabotage German airfields. However, things don't go as planned at the first airfield; one of Billy's bombs (\"safecracker specials\") fails to detonate, much to Mason's anger, forcing Billy to commandeer an anti-aircraft gun to destroy the final plane. Mason is wounded, and after an argument with Mason about whose fault it was that Mason could have been killed, Billy and Mason steal a German's car and drive to the second airfield. However, due to Mason's wounds, Billy is forced to infiltrate the airfield alone. Billy is able to destroy the objectives, but detours to a nearby bunker to collect medical supplies for Mason, and uses the radio there to call HMS ''Sussex'' for evacuation. After destroying the base's radar stations, Billy returns to report to Mason. However, Mason is furious when he finds out Billy radioed for help, since it would alert the Germans to their exact location. A massive German force begins to pursue them and they are forced to hide in some ruins. Billy begins to express doubts at his own competence and their chances of survival, as well as grieving over his failure to please his father. Mason confides in Billy that he picked him to volunteer for the unit because his many attempts to rob banks, especially three of one bank, showed him as a \"tryer,\" a person who doesn't easily give up. Inspired, Billy fights alongside Mason in a last stand. They manage to hold off the German forces long enough for British reinforcements to arrive, and the Germans are subsequently routed. In the aftermath, Billy and Mason have a newfound respect for each other as they head off for their next mission.\n\n=== Nordlys ===\nIn the spring of 1943, in Rjukjan, Norway, a British commando unit is killed attempting to infiltrate a German occupied facility and Astrid, the Norwegian resistance fighter assisting them, is captured. Meanwhile, Astrid's daughter Solveig fights her way into the facility to rescue her. However, Astrid refuses to leave, insisting that the facility must be destroyed first since it is producing heavy water for Germany's nuclear weapon research. The pair manage to sabotage the facility, but much of the heavy water is evacuated by truck. They attempt to pursue, but are cornered on a bridge by German forces commanded by [[Leutnant]] Weber. Entrusting Solveig with the mission to destroy the heavy water, Astrid pushes her off the bridge to prevent her from being captured. Narrowly surviving the fall, Solveig carries on the mission, pursuing the trucks and destroying all of them. Unfortunately, the Germans have already loaded Astrid and some of the heavy water on board a U-boat, and Solveig is unable to board it. Astrid steals a grenade and uses it to destroy the U-boat and the heavy water, killing herself and Weber in the process. It is left unclear whether Solveig survived the explosion or not.\n\n=== Tirailleur ===\nIn the autumn of 1944 after the Allied [[landings at Normandy]], Senegalese soldiers are sent to help liberate France from German occupation. One of these soldiers is the young recruit Deme Cisse, who meets fellow soldier and older brother Idrissa upon arriving in France. However, Deme quickly experiences discrimination from the French army, with the Senegalese being blocked from fighting on the frontlines and instead assigned to perform menial tasks such as filling sandbags. Finally, the Senegalese are allowed to participate in an assault on a heavily fortified German position by moving to destroy a set of anti-aircraft guns defending the area. The Senegalese are ambushed on the way to their objective, but they are able to capture and hold a German strongpoint. Idrissa is reluctant to proceed further since their commanders are dead and they have no support, but Deme is determined to keep pushing to the anti-aircraft guns in order to win recognition from the French army, and he convinces the rest of the unit to follow him. They are successful in destroying the anti-aircraft guns, but suffer heavy casualties in the process. In addition, a wounded German soldier boasts they will be surrounded, destroyed in the inevitable counterattack, and that nobody will know they were even there. A hopeless Idrissa, fearing that he won't come home to his family alive, considers withdrawing, but Deme insists that they do what the Germans won't expect them to: directly attack the German headquarters. They manage to break into the headquarters, but are ambushed by a Tiger tank. Idrissa is mortally wounded after destroying the Tiger, much to Deme's shock. Despite Deme's unit having taken the headquarters, their involvement in the operation is covered up and forgotten. In the present, an elderly Deme recounts his story and declares that no matter what happens, nothing can erase what he and his comrades had done, and that he is proud of it.\n\n=== The Last Tiger ===\nIn the spring of 1945, veteran [[Tiger I]] commander Peter M\u00fcller and his tank crew participates in the defense of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] against invading American forces, with orders from High Command that all German soldiers must fight to the death. After surviving a series of heavy engagements, the Tiger is forced to take cover from Allied bombers. At the behest of Schr\u00f6der, the crew's young and fanatically patriotic gunner, M\u00fcller has young loader Hartmann scout the ruins ahead for a passage through. A large American tank column suddenly appears, forcing the crew to leave Hartmann behind. The Tiger receives orders to regroup at the cathedral with other remaining German forces for a final defense; en route, they discover Hartmann had been executed by [[hanging]] along with several other accused deserters. They reach the cathedral, only to find it abandoned and are quickly surrounded by the American army, who demand their surrender. With new orders to defend their position, the crew fights off the enemy before making their way to the bridge, which leads back to German lines. The bridge is suddenly destroyed by a series of explosions, and the Tiger is disabled. Kertz, the crew's veteran driver, expresses his disillusionment in the German cause and decides to desert despite M\u00fcller's pleading; Kertz is then shot and fatally wounded by Schr\u00f6der. As M\u00fcller cradles his friend's corpse, American soldiers arrive and again demand their surrender, but the fanatical Schr\u00f6der continues to fight. M\u00fcller discards his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] and raises his arms in surrender, after which an enraged Schr\u00f6der aims his [[MP40]] at him. The screen cuts to black and a burst of gunfire is heard, leaving M\u00fcller's fate ambiguous.\n\n== Development ==\nDICE unveiled the first details surrounding ''Battlefield V'' on May 23, 2018, with more information to be unveiled during the EA Play press conference near [[E3 2018]] in June. DICE has stated that, unlike ''Battlefield 1'', it does not plan to use paid [[downloadable content]], or \"[[loot box]]es\" for non-cosmetic items within ''Battlefield V''; new content will be added to the game for all players over time (which, itself, will progress through the different stages of World War II), at no additional charge.<ref name=\"polygon-nopass\">{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|title=Battlefield 5 ditches the premium pass|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115940/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|archive-date=May 24, 2018|work=Polygon|access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|title=\u2018Battlefield V\u2019 Hits Oct. 19, Explores WWII Free of Premium Pass, Loot Boxes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120154/http://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|archive-date=May 24, 2018|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=May 23, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The decision to exclude these features was made following the outrage over the loot box system in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', another EA DICE title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|title=Here's Our First Look At Battlefield V, Which Goes Back To WWII|work=Kotaku|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115705/https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|archive-date=May 24, 2018|access-date=May 24, 2018|date=May 23, 2018|last=Scheirer|first=Jason}}</ref> The game was originally set to release on October 19, but was delayed to November 20 to enable the developers to \"make some final adjustments to core gameplay.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5-release-date-delayed-to-november/|title=Battlefield 5 release date delayed to November|publisher=}}</ref> It is one of the first major games to make use of real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[DLSS]], with help from [[Nvidia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/battlefield-5-ray-tracing-benchmarks,5911.html|title=Here's How Battlefield V Performs with Ray Tracing|last=Angelini|first=Chris|last2=Freedman|first2=Andrew E.|work=Tom's Hardware|date=November 16, 2018|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.techspot.com/article/1794-nvidia-rtx-dlss-battlefield/| title=Battlefield V DLSS Tested: Overpromised, Underdelivered| publisher=techspot.com| date=2019-02-19| accessdate=2020-04-06| quote=''Of course, this is to be expected.

Upon release, ''Battlefield V'' received generally favourable reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay but criticized for its shortage of content at launch and lack of innovation. The game sold 7.3 million copies by the end of 2018 but was a commercial disappointment for Electronic Arts. \n\nOn April 23 2020 it was announced that live service for the game would continue until summer of 2020, when the game would receive its last major update.Therefore, there will be no adding of certain contents as expected by the community, such as the[[Eastern front (World War II)|Eastern front]], [[Battle of Berlin]], [[Battle of Normandy]], [[Battle of the Bulge]], [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and other, nor adding of the [[Soviet Union]]<ref>{{cite web |title=An update on the future of Battlefield V |url=https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1253307936962678784 |website=Twitter |publisher=Battlefield |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Correct, and we'll have more details about what's included in the summer update closer to that time. |url=https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1253314285201051649 |website=Twitter |publisher=Battlefield |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Battlefield V'' is focused extensively on party-based features and mechanics, scarcity of resources, and removing \"abstractions\" from game mechanics to increase realism.<ref name=\"vergereturn\" /> There is an expanded focus on player customization through the new [[Company (military unit)|Company]] system, where players can create multiple characters with cosmetic and weapon options.

In Grand Operations, each round will have specific objectives, and performance in each stage will influence the next. If the final day ends with a close margin of victory, the match will culminate with a \"Final Stand,\" with players fighting to the last man standing on a continually shrinking map.

The fourth campaign, ''\"The Last Tiger,\"'' was released on December 5, 2018, which depicts the struggles of a German [[Tiger I]] tank crew during the [[Ruhr Pocket]] in the closing days of the war.\n\n=== My Country Calling ===\nThe introductory episode of Battlefield V, titled \u201cMy Country Calling\u201d or \u201cPrologue\u201d, is a tutorial required upon first launching up the game. In it, the player learns the basic mechanics on how infantry, tanks, and planes, as well as setting the tone for future war stories. The prologue begins after Battlefield 1's \u201cStorm of Steel\u201d left off, before cutting to a black screen with white text, commentating on how society was quick to forget the horrors of the First World War. The prologue then jumps forward to London 1939, with Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war on Germany being played on the radio. The narration then begins before the player steps into the shoes of a British paratrooper, during a night raid at Narvik Docks, 1940. The player then must defeat several German soldiers before a Tiger I tank appears, and the screen fades to white. The player is then placed into control of tank commander Peter Muller, the main character of the \u201cLast Tiger\u201d war story. In this instance, however, the player is tasked with breaking British lines at Tobruk, before an artillery strike causes another character change. After the transition, the player is then put in control of a free French sniper, presumed to be one of the same soldiers as the \u201cTirailleur\u201d war story, around the Kasserine Pass. After sniping several enemies during an ambush sequence, the player character is then killed when a strafing run hits them. The camera then pans to a Bf 109 pilot titled Yellow-Seven. This time, the player must shoot down a variety of Blenheim and Spitfire aircraft, before being shot down themselves. Finally, the player takes the role of a British machine gunner during the Final Defense at Nijmegen Bridge, 1944. A V1 flying bomb soon detonates on their position, however, and the player goes into a last stand before getting killed in the onslaught of gunfire. Upon completion of all introductory segments, the player is then shown cinematic clips of the war stories, before being treated to the game's title card.\n\n=== Under No Flag ===\nIn the spring of 1942, convicted bank robber William Sidney \"Billy\" Bridger, the son of another infamous bank robber, Arthur Bridger, volunteers to join the British military in order to avoid jail time, and is assigned as a demolitions expert to a Special Boat Service team led by George Mason ([[Craig Fairbrass]]). Billy and Mason infiltrate occupied North Africa in order to sabotage German airfields. However, things don't go as planned at the first airfield; one of Billy's bombs (\"safecracker specials\") fails to detonate, much to Mason's anger, forcing Billy to commandeer an anti-aircraft gun to destroy the final plane. Mason is wounded, and after an argument with Mason about whose fault it was that Mason could have been killed, Billy and Mason steal a German's car and drive to the second airfield. However, due to Mason's wounds, Billy is forced to infiltrate the airfield alone. Billy is able to destroy the objectives, but detours to a nearby bunker to collect medical supplies for Mason, and uses the radio there to call HMS ''Sussex'' for evacuation. After destroying the base's radar stations, Billy returns to report to Mason. However, Mason is furious when he finds out Billy radioed for help, since it would alert the Germans to their exact location. A massive German force begins to pursue them and they are forced to hide in some ruins. Billy begins to express doubts at his own competence and their chances of survival, as well as grieving over his failure to please his father. Mason confides in Billy that he picked him to volunteer for the unit because his many attempts to rob banks, especially three of one bank, showed him as a \"tryer,\" a person who doesn't easily give up. Inspired, Billy fights alongside Mason in a last stand. They manage to hold off the German forces long enough for British reinforcements to arrive, and the Germans are subsequently routed. In the aftermath, Billy and Mason have a newfound respect for each other as they head off for their next mission.\n\n=== Nordlys ===\nIn the spring of 1943, in Rjukjan, Norway, a British commando unit is killed attempting to infiltrate a German occupied facility and Astrid, the Norwegian resistance fighter assisting them, is captured. Meanwhile, Astrid's daughter Solveig fights her way into the facility to rescue her. However, Astrid refuses to leave, insisting that the facility must be destroyed first since it is producing heavy water for Germany's nuclear weapon research. The pair manage to sabotage the facility, but much of the heavy water is evacuated by truck. They attempt to pursue, but are cornered on a bridge by German forces commanded by [[Leutnant]] Weber. Entrusting Solveig with the mission to destroy the heavy water, Astrid pushes her off the bridge to prevent her from being captured. Narrowly surviving the fall, Solveig carries on the mission, pursuing the trucks and destroying all of them. Unfortunately, the Germans have already loaded Astrid and some of the heavy water on board a U-boat, and Solveig is unable to board it. Astrid steals a grenade and uses it to destroy the U-boat and the heavy water, killing herself and Weber in the process. It is left unclear whether Solveig survived the explosion or not.\n\n=== Tirailleur ===\nIn the autumn of 1944 after the Allied [[landings at Normandy]], Senegalese soldiers are sent to help liberate France from German occupation. One of these soldiers is the young recruit Deme Cisse, who meets fellow soldier and older brother Idrissa upon arriving in France. However, Deme quickly experiences discrimination from the French army, with the Senegalese being blocked from fighting on the frontlines and instead assigned to perform menial tasks such as filling sandbags. Finally, the Senegalese are allowed to participate in an assault on a heavily fortified German position by moving to destroy a set of anti-aircraft guns defending the area. The Senegalese are ambushed on the way to their objective, but they are able to capture and hold a German strongpoint. Idrissa is reluctant to proceed further since their commanders are dead and they have no support, but Deme is determined to keep pushing to the anti-aircraft guns in order to win recognition from the French army, and he convinces the rest of the unit to follow him. They are successful in destroying the anti-aircraft guns, but suffer heavy casualties in the process. In addition, a wounded German soldier boasts they will be surrounded, destroyed in the inevitable counterattack, and that nobody will know they were even there. A hopeless Idrissa, fearing that he won't come home to his family alive, considers withdrawing, but Deme insists that they do what the Germans won't expect them to: directly attack the German headquarters. They manage to break into the headquarters, but are ambushed by a Tiger tank. Idrissa is mortally wounded after destroying the Tiger, much to Deme's shock. Despite Deme's unit having taken the headquarters, their involvement in the operation is covered up and forgotten. In the present, an elderly Deme recounts his story and declares that no matter what happens, nothing can erase what he and his comrades had done, and that he is proud of it.\n\n=== The Last Tiger ===\nIn the spring of 1945, veteran [[Tiger I]] commander Peter M\u00fcller and his tank crew participates in the defense of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] against invading American forces, with orders from High Command that all German soldiers must fight to the death. After surviving a series of heavy engagements, the Tiger is forced to take cover from Allied bombers. At the behest of Schr\u00f6der, the crew's young and fanatically patriotic gunner, M\u00fcller has young loader Hartmann scout the ruins ahead for a passage through. A large American tank column suddenly appears, forcing the crew to leave Hartmann behind. The Tiger receives orders to regroup at the cathedral with other remaining German forces for a final defense; en route, they discover Hartmann had been executed by [[hanging]] along with several other accused deserters. They reach the cathedral, only to find it abandoned and are quickly surrounded by the American army, who demand their surrender. With new orders to defend their position, the crew fights off the enemy before making their way to the bridge, which leads back to German lines. The bridge is suddenly destroyed by a series of explosions, and the Tiger is disabled. Kertz, the crew's veteran driver, expresses his disillusionment in the German cause and decides to desert despite M\u00fcller's pleading; Kertz is then shot and fatally wounded by Schr\u00f6der. As M\u00fcller cradles his friend's corpse, American soldiers arrive and again demand their surrender, but the fanatical Schr\u00f6der continues to fight. M\u00fcller discards his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] and raises his arms in surrender, after which an enraged Schr\u00f6der aims his [[MP40]] at him. The screen cuts to black and a burst of gunfire is heard, leaving M\u00fcller's fate ambiguous.\n\n== Development ==\nDICE unveiled the first details surrounding ''Battlefield V'' on May 23, 2018, with more information to be unveiled during the EA Play press conference near [[E3 2018]] in June. DICE has stated that, unlike ''Battlefield 1'', it does not plan to use paid [[downloadable content]], or \"[[loot box]]es\" for non-cosmetic items within ''Battlefield V''; new content will be added to the game for all players over time (which, itself, will progress through the different stages of World War II), at no additional charge.<ref name=\"polygon-nopass\">{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|title=Battlefield 5 ditches the premium pass|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115940/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|archive-date=May 24, 2018|work=Polygon|access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|title=\u2018Battlefield V\u2019 Hits Oct. 19, Explores WWII Free of Premium Pass, Loot Boxes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120154/http://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|archive-date=May 24, 2018|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=May 23, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The decision to exclude these features was made following the outrage over the loot box system in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', another EA DICE title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|title=Here's Our First Look At Battlefield V, Which Goes Back To WWII|work=Kotaku|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115705/https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|archive-date=May 24, 2018|access-date=May 24, 2018|date=May 23, 2018|last=Scheirer|first=Jason}}</ref> The game was originally set to release on October 19, but was delayed to November 20 to enable the developers to \"make some final adjustments to core gameplay.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5-release-date-delayed-to-november/|title=Battlefield 5 release date delayed to November|publisher=}}</ref> It is one of the first major games to make use of real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[DLSS]], with help from [[Nvidia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/battlefield-5-ray-tracing-benchmarks,5911.html|title=Here's How Battlefield V Performs with Ray Tracing|last=Angelini|first=Chris|last2=Freedman|first2=Andrew E.|work=Tom's Hardware|date=November 16, 2018|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.techspot.com/article/1794-nvidia-rtx-dlss-battlefield/| title=Battlefield V DLSS Tested: Overpromised, Underdelivered| publisher=techspot.com| date=2019-02-19| accessdate=2020-04-06| quote=''Of course, this is to be expected.

Wilson also highlighted ''Battlefield V''{{'}}s long development cycle, and release in a month of strong competition. EA's stock prices also faced its worst drop in more than a decade during its third quarter of the fiscal year, declining by around 18 percent, which EA attributed in part to the poor sales of the game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makuch |first1=Eddie |title=Battlefield 5 Fails To Meet Sales Targets, And EA Explains Why |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-5-fails-to-meet-sales-targets-and-ea-e/1100-6464832/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Fraser |title=Battlefield 5 did not meet EA's sales expectations |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5-did-not-meet-eas-sales-expectations/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nunneley |first1=Stephany |title=Battlefield 5 sales didn\u2019t meet expectations during Q3, says EA |url=https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/05/battlefield-5-sales-didnt-meet-expectations/ |website=VG247 |accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, the PlayStation 4 version of ''Battlefield V'' sold 110,653 during its first week of release, placing it at number four on the all format sales chart.<ref>{{cite web |last=Romano |first=Sal |date=November 28, 2018 |url=https://gematsu.com/2018/11/media-create-sales-11-19-18-11-25-18 |title=Media Create Sales: 11/19/18 \u2013 11/25/18 |publisher=Gematsu |accessdate=May 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" would not air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Mama, Eunice and Ed come back home from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Mama, Eunice and Ed come back home from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

often reflect the donors' priorities.\"<ref name=\"Williams\"/> A number of scholars interviewed by the ''Times'' expressed alarm at the trend, saying that the \"donations have led to implicit agreements that the research groups would refrain from criticizing the donor governments.\"<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\nThe revelation of the think tank's choice to accept the payment from Qatar was especially controversial because at the time, Indyk was acting as a [[Israeli-Palestinian peace process|peace negotiator]] between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinians]], and because Qatar funds [[Jihadism|jihadist groups]] in the Middle East and is the main financial backer of [[Hamas]], \"the mortal enemy of both the State of Israel and [[Mahmoud Abbas]]' Fatah
