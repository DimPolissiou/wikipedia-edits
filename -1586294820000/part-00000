Thus, in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other [[Eurozone]] partners, through a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for [[public servant]]s. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4 percent, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the [[European Union]]'s [[Stability and Growth Pact]] three percent limit.\n\nIn November 2010, [[risk premium]]s on Portuguese [[bond (finance)|bond]]s hit euro lifetime highs as investors and creditors worried that the country would fail to reign in its budget deficit and debt. The yield on the country's 10-year government bonds reached 7 percent&nbsp;\u2013 a level the Portuguese Finance Minister [[Fernando Teixeira dos Santos]] had previously said would require the country to seek financial help from international institutions.\n\nA report published in January 2011 by the [[Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias]], a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974 and 2010, the democratic [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese Republic government]]s had encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This had funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]], inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[public debt]] creation and mismanaged European [[structural and cohesion funds]] for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister S\u00f3crates's cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110108021723/http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1750097&seccao=Media Grande investiga\u00e7\u00e3o DN Conhe\u00e7a o verdadeiro peso do Estado], [[Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias]] (7 January 2011)</ref>\n\nOn 23 March 2011, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates resigned following passage of a [[no confidence]] motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110323-portuguese-parliament-votes-against-austerity-plan-jose-socrates-eurozone |title=Portuguese parliament votes against austerity plan |date=23 March 2011 |publisher=[[France 24]] |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 2011, the resigning Prime Minister announced on the television that the country, facing a status of bankruptcy, would request financial assistance to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] (at the time managed by [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]], like Greece and the Republic of Ireland had done before.\n\nIn order to accomplish the [[European Union]]/IMF-led rescue plan for Portugal's [[sovereign debt]] crisis, in July and August 2011, the new government led by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] announced it was going to cut on state spending and increase austerity measures, including public servant wage cuts and additional tax increases.\n\n==Rest of Europe==\n\nThe entire economy of the European Union declined by 0.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1014454.shtml|title=Eurozone GDP fell 0.2% in the second quarter of 2008: EU27 GDP fell 0.1%; Economies of Eurozone's Big 4 \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain all shrank|publisher=Finfacts Ireland|date=14 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> A European Commission forecast predicted Germany, Spain and the UK would all enter a recession by the end of the year while France and Italy would have flat growth in the third quarter following second quarter contractions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cf5d0f08-7f49-11dd-a3da-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1|title=Recession to hit Germany, UK and Spain|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\n[[Denmark]] showed a contraction of 0.6 percent in the first quarter of 2008 following a contraction of 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d5d98922-539a-11dd-8dd2-000077b07658.html |title=Early Easter puts Danish economy in recession |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-19}}</ref> Revised data for Denmark, however cancelled the early recession, as GDP ended at +1.0% in Q4 2007 followed by -1.4% in Q1 2008 and +1.5% in Q2 2008.

Thus, in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other [[Eurozone]] partners, through a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for [[public servant]]s. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4 percent, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the [[European Union]]'s [[Stability and Growth Pact]] three percent limit.\n\nIn November 2010, [[risk premium]]s on Portuguese [[bond (finance)|bond]]s hit euro lifetime highs as investors and creditors worried that the country would fail to reign in its budget deficit and debt. The yield on the country's 10-year government bonds reached 7 percent&nbsp;\u2013 a level the Portuguese Finance Minister [[Fernando Teixeira dos Santos]] had previously said would require the country to seek financial help from international institutions.\n\nA report published in January 2011 by the [[Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias]], a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974 and 2010, the democratic [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese Republic government]]s had encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This had funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]], inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants.

{"title_page": "Grand canonical ensemble", "text_new": "{{Short description|Statistical ensemble of particles in thermodynamic equilibrium}}{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=Ensembles}}\n\nIn [[statistical mechanics]], a '''grand canonical ensemble''' (also known as the macrocanonical ensemble) is the [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] that is used to represent the possible states of a mechanical system of particles that are in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] (thermal and chemical) with a reservoir.<ref name=\"gibbs\">{{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Josiah Willard |authorlink=Josiah Willard Gibbs |title=Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics |year=1902 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York|title-link=Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics }}</ref> The system is said to be open in the sense that the system can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir, so that various possible states of the system can differ in both their total energy and total number of particles. The system's volume, shape, and other external coordinates are kept the same in all possible states of the system.\n\nThe thermodynamic variables of the grand canonical ensemble are [[chemical potential]] (symbol: {{math|''\u00b5''}}) and [[absolute temperature]] (symbol: {{math|''T''}}). The ensemble is also dependent on mechanical variables such as volume (symbol: {{math|''V''}}) which influence the nature of the system's internal states. This ensemble is therefore sometimes called the ''' {{math|''\u00b5VT''}} ensemble''', as each of these three quantities are constants of the ensemble.\n\n== Basics ==\n\nIn simple terms, the grand canonical ensemble assigns a probability {{math|''P''}} to each distinct [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] given by the following exponential:\n:<math>P = e^{\\frac{\\Omega + \\mu N - E}{k T}},</math>\nwhere {{math|''N''}} is the number of particles in the microstate and {{math|''E''}} is the total energy of the microstate. {{math|''k''}} is [[Boltzmann's constant]].\n\nThe number {{math|\u03a9}} is known as the [[grand potential]] and is constant for the ensemble. However, the probabilities and {{math|\u03a9}} will vary if different {{math|''\u00b5'', ''V'', ''T''}} are selected. The grand potential {{math|\u03a9}} serves two roles: to provide a normalization factor for the probability distribution (the probabilities, over the complete set of microstates, must add up to one); and, many important ensemble averages can be directly calculated from the function {{math|\u03a9(''\u00b5'', ''V'', ''T'')}}.\n\nIn the case where more than one kind of particle is allowed to vary in number, the probability expression generalizes to\n:<math>P = e^{\\frac{\\Omega + \\mu_1 N_1 + \\mu_2 N_2 + \\ldots + \\mu_s N_s - E}{k T}},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u00b5''<sub>1</sub>}} is the chemical potential for the first kind of particles, {{math|''N''<sub>1</sub>}} is the number of that kind of particle in the microstate, {{math|''\u00b5''<sub>2</sub>}} is the chemical potential for the second kind of particles and so on ({{math|''s''}} is the number of distinct kinds of particles). However, these particle numbers should be defined carefully (see the [[#Requirement of particle number conservation|note on particle number conservation]] below).\n\nGrand ensembles are apt for use when describing systems such as the [[electron]]s in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], or the [[photons]] in a cavity, where the shape is fixed but the energy and number of particles can easily fluctuate due to contact with a reservoir (e.g., an electrical ground or a [[black body|dark surface]], in these cases). The grand canonical ensemble provides a natural setting for an exact derivation of the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] or [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] for a system of non-interacting quantum particles (see examples below).\n\n; Note on formulation\n: An alternative formulation for the same concept writes the probability as <math>\\textstyle P = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal Z} e^{(\\mu N-E)/(k T)}</math>, using the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|grand partition function]] <math>\\textstyle \\mathcal Z = e^{-\\Omega/(k T)}</math> rather than the grand potential. The equations in this article (in terms of grand potential) may be restated in terms of the grand partition function by simple mathematical manipulations.\n\n==Applicability==\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble is the ensemble that describes the possible states of an isolated system that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir (the derivation proceeds along lines analogous to the heat bath derivation of the normal [[canonical ensemble]], and can be found in Reif<ref name=\"Reif\">{{cite book | last = Reif | first = F. | title = Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics | publisher = McGraw\u2013Hill | year = 1965 | isbn = 9780070518001 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofst00fred }}</ref>). The grand canonical ensemble applies to systems of any size, small or large; it is only necessary to assume that the reservoir with which it is in contact is much larger (i.e., to take the [[macroscopic limit]]).\n\nThe condition that the system is isolated is necessary in order to ensure it has well-defined thermodynamic quantities and evolution.<ref name=\"gibbs\"/> In practice, however, it is desirable to apply the grand canonical ensemble to describe systems that are in direct contact with the reservoir, since it is that contact that ensures the equilibrium. The use of the grand canonical ensemble in these cases is usually justified either 1) by assuming that the contact is weak, or 2) by incorporating a part of the reservoir connection into the system under analysis, so that the connection's influence on the region of interest is correctly modeled. Alternatively, theoretical approaches can be used to model the influence of the connection, yielding an [[open statistical ensemble]].\n\nAnother case in which the grand canonical ensemble appears is when considering a system that is large and thermodynamic (a system that is \"in equilibrium with itself\"). Even if the exact conditions of the system do not actually allow for variations in energy or particle number, the grand canonical ensemble can be used to simplify calculations of some thermodynamic properties. The reason for this is that various thermodynamic ensembles ([[microcanonical ensemble|microcanonical]], [[canonical ensemble|canonical]]) become equivalent in some aspects to the grand canonical ensemble, once the system is very large.<ref group=note>To quote Reif, \"For purposes of calculating mean values of physical quantities, it makes no noticeable difference whether a macroscopic system is isolated, or in contact with a reservoir with which it can only exchange energy, or in contact with a reservoir with which it can exchange both energy and particles. [...] In some problems where the constraint of a fixed number of particles is cumbersome, one can thus readily circumvent the complication by approximating the actual situation with [...] the grand canonical distribution.\"</ref> Of course, for small systems, the different ensembles are no longer equivalent even in the mean. As a result, the grand canonical ensemble can be highly inaccurate when applied to small systems of fixed particle number, such as atomic nuclei.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chaudhuri | first1 = G. | last2 = Gupta | first2 = S. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevC.76.014619 | title = Specific heat and bimodality in canonical and grand canonical versions of the thermodynamic model | journal = Physical Review C | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 014619 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0704.0288 |bibcode = 2007PhRvC..76a4619C }}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n\n{{unordered list\n|1= ''Uniqueness'': The grand canonical ensemble is uniquely determined for a given system at given temperature and given chemical potentials, and does not depend on arbitrary choices such as choice of coordinate system (classical mechanics) or basis (quantum mechanics).<ref name=\"gibbs\"/>\n|2= ''Statistical equilibrium'' (steady state): A grand canonical ensemble does not evolve over time, despite the fact that the underlying system is in constant motion.

K. |last2=Ashok |first2=J. |year=2005 |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Focusing on just one orbital labelled {{math|''i''}}, the total energy for a [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] of {{math|''N''}} particles in this orbital will be {{math|''N\u03f5''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, where {{math|''\u03f5''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the characteristic energy level of that orbital. The grand potential for the orbital is given by one of two forms, depending on whether the orbital is bosonic or fermionic:\n{{unordered list\n|1= For [[fermion]]s, the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] allows only two microstates for the orbital (occupation of 0 or 1), giving a two-term series\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Omega_i & = -kT \\ln \\Big( \\sum_{N=0}^{1} e^{\\frac{N\\mu - N\\epsilon_i}{k T}}\\Big) \\\\\n & = - kT \\ln\\Big(1 + e^{\\frac{\\mu - \\epsilon_i}{k T}}\\Big)\n\\end{align}</math>\n|2= For [[boson]]s, {{math|''N''}} may be any nonnegative integer and each value of {{math|''N''}} counts as one microstate due to the [[Identical particles|indistinguishability of particles]], leading to a [[geometric series]]:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Omega_i & = -kT \\ln \\Big( \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{\\frac{N\\mu - N\\epsilon_i}{k T}}\\Big) \\\\\n & = + kT\\ln\\Big(1 - e^{\\frac{\\mu - \\epsilon_i}{k T}}\\Big).\n\\end{align}</math>\n}}\nIn each case the value <math>\\scriptstyle\\langle N_i\\rangle = -\\tfrac{\\partial \\Omega_i}{\\partial \\mu}</math> gives the thermodynamic average number of particles on the orbital: the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution]] for fermions, and the [[Bose\u2013Einstein distribution]] for bosons.\nConsidering again the entire system, the total grand potential is found by adding up the {{math|&Omega;<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all orbitals.\n\n====Indistinguishable classical particles ====\nIn classical mechanics it is also possible to consider indistinguishable particles (in fact, indistinguishability is a prerequisite for defining a chemical potential in a consistent manner; all particles of a given kind must be interchangeable<ref name=\"gibbs\"/>). We again consider placing multiple particles of the same kind into the same microstate of single-particle phase space, which we again call an \"orbital\". However, compared to quantum mechanics, the classical case is complicated by the fact that a microstate in classical mechanics does not refer to a single point in phase space but rather to an extended region in phase space: one microstate contains an infinite number of states, all distinct but of similar character. As a result, when multiple particles are placed into the same orbital, the overall collection of the particles (in the system phase space) does not count as one whole microstate but rather only a ''fraction'' of a microstate, because identical states (formed by permutation of identical particles) should not be overcounted. The overcounting correction factor is the [[factorial]] of the number of particles.\n\nThe statistics in this case take the form of an exponential power series\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Omega_{\\rm orb} & = -kT \\ln \\Big( \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{N!} e^{\\frac{N\\mu - N\\epsilon_{\\rm orb}}{k T}}\\Big) \\\\\n & = -kT \\ln \\Big( e^{e^{\\frac{\\mu - \\epsilon_{\\rm orb}}{k T}}}\\Big) \\\\\n & = - kT e^{\\frac{\\mu - \\epsilon_{\\rm orb}}{k T}},\n\\end{align}</math>\nthe value <math>\\scriptstyle\\langle N_{\\rm orb}\\rangle = -\\tfrac{\\partial \\Omega_{\\rm orb}}{\\partial \\mu}</math> corresponding to [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]].\n\n===Ionization of an isolated atom===\n\n[[File:Surface ionization of cesium.svg|thumb|Surface ionization effect in a vaporized [[cesium]] atom at 1500 K, calculated using the method in this section (also including [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]]).

At room temperature this situation is not stable since the atom tends to [[adsorb]] to the exposed lining of the box instead of floating freely. At high temperatures, however, the atoms are evaporated from the surface in ionic form; this spontaneous [[surface ionization]] effect has been used as a cesium [[ion source]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Alton | first1 = G.

Examples: ([[semiconductor physics]]) distinct [[quasi-Fermi level]]s (electron chemical potentials) in the [[conduction band]] and [[valence band]]; ([[spintronic]]s) distinct spin-up and spin-down chemical potentials; ([[cryogenic]]s) distinct [[parahydrogen]] and [[orthohydrogen]] chemical potentials.\n\n==Precise expressions for the ensemble==\n\nThe precise mathematical expression for statistical ensembles has a distinct form depending on the type of mechanics under consideration (quantum or classical), as the notion of a \"microstate\" is considerably different. In quantum mechanics, the grand canonical ensemble affords a simple description since diagonalization provides a set of distinct [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s of a system, each with well-defined energy and particle number. The classical mechanical case is more complex as it involves not stationary states but instead an integral over canonical [[phase space]].\n\n=== Quantum mechanical ===\n\n{{details|topic=the representation of ensembles in quantum mechanics|Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)}}\n\nA statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a [[density matrix]], denoted by <math>\\hat \\rho</math>. The grand canonical ensemble is the density matrix{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n:<math>\\hat \\rho = \\exp\\big(\\tfrac{1}{kT}(\\Omega + \\mu_1 \\hat N_1 + \\ldots + \\mu_s \\hat N_s - \\hat H)\\big),</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u0124''}} is the system's total energy operator ([[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>1</sub>}} is the system's total [[particle number operator]] for particles of type 1, {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>2</sub>}} is the total [[particle number operator]] for particles of type 2, and so on. {{math|exp}} is the [[matrix exponential]] operator. The grand potential {{math|\u03a9}} is determined by the probability normalization condition that the density matrix has a [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of one, <math> Tr \\hat \\rho = 1</math>:\n:<math>e^{-\\frac{\\Omega}{k T}} = \\operatorname{Tr} \\exp\\big(\\tfrac{1}{kT}(\\mu_1 \\hat N_1 + \\ldots + \\mu_s \\hat N_s - \\hat H)\\big).</math>\n\nNote that for the grand ensemble, the basis states of the operators {{math|''\u0124''}}, {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>1</sub>}}, etc. are all states with ''multiple particles'' in [[Fock space]], and the density matrix is defined on the same basis. Since the energy and particle numbers are all separately conserved, these operators are mutually commuting.\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble can alternatively be written in a simple form using [[bra\u2013ket notation]], since it is possible (given the mutually commuting nature of the energy and particle number operators) to find a complete  [[Diagonalizable_matrix#Simultaneous_diagonalization|basis of simultaneous eigenstates]] {{math|{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9}}, indexed by {{math|''i''}}, where {{math|''\u0124''{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9 {{=}} ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9}}, {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>1</sub>{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9 {{=}} ''N''<sub>1,''i''</sub>{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9}}, and so on. Given such an eigenbasis, the grand canonical ensemble is simply\n:<math>\\hat \\rho = \\sum_i e^{\\frac{\\Omega + \\mu_1 N_{1,i} + \\ldots + \\mu_s N_{s,i} - E_i}{k T}} |\\psi_i\\rangle \\langle \\psi_i | </math>\n:<math>e^{-\\frac{\\Omega}{k T}} = \\sum_i e^{\\frac{\\mu_1 N_{1,i} + \\ldots + \\mu_s N_{s,i} - E_i}{k T}}.</math>\nwhere the sum is over the complete set of states with state {{math|''i''}} having {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}} total energy, {{math|''N''<sub>1,''i''</sub>}} particles of type 1, {{math|''N''<sub>2,''i''</sub>}} particles of type 2, and so on.\n\n===Classical mechanical===\n\n{{details|topic=the representation of ensembles in classical mechanics|Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)}}\n\nIn classical mechanics, a grand ensemble is instead represented by a [[joint probability density function]] defined over multiple [[phase space]]s of varying dimensions, {{math|''\u03c1''(''N''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''N''<sub>''s''</sub>, ''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''q''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''q''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where the {{math|''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and {{math|''q''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''q''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are the [[canonical coordinates]] (generalized momenta and generalized coordinates) of the system's internal degrees of freedom. The expression for the grand canonical ensemble is somewhat more delicate than the [[canonical ensemble]] since:<ref name=\"gibbs\"/>\n* The number of particles and thus the number of coordinates {{math|''n''}} varies between the different phase spaces, and,\n* it is vital to consider whether permuting similar particles counts as a distinct state or not.\nIn a system of particles, the number of degrees of freedom {{math|''n''}} depends on the number of particles in a way that depends on the physical situation.

In the system's equation of motion each particle is forever tracked as a distinguishable entity, and yet there are also valid states of the system where the positions of each particle have simply been swapped: these states are represented at different places in phase space, yet would seem to be equivalent.\n\nIf the permutations of similar particles are regarded to count as distinct states, then the factor {{math|''C''}} above is simply {{math|''C'' {{=}} 1}}. From this point of view, ensembles include every permuted state as a separate microstate. Although appearing benign at first, this leads to a problem of severely non-extensive entropy in the canonical ensemble, known today as the [[Gibbs paradox]]. In the grand canonical ensemble a further logical inconsistency occurs: the number of distinguishable permutations depends not only on how many particles are in the system, but also on how many particles are in the reservoir (since the system may exchange particles with a reservoir). In this case the entropy and chemical potential are non-extensive but also badly defined, depending on a parameter (reservoir size) that should be irrelevant.\n\nTo solve these issues it is necessary that the exchange of two similar particles (within the system, or between the system and reservoir) must not be regarded as giving a distinct state of the system.<ref name=\"gibbs\"/><ref group=note>This can be compared to the [[canonical ensemble]] where it is optional to consider particles as distinguishable; this only gives {{math|''N''}}-dependent error in entropy, which is unobservable as long as {{math|''N''}} is kept constant. In general, however, there is no such freedom: \"when the number of particles in a system is to be treated as variable, the average index of probability for phases generically defined corresponds to entropy.\" (Gibbs).</ref> In order to incorporate this fact, integrals are still carried over full phase space but the result is divided by\n:<math>C = N_1! N_2! \\ldots N_s!,</math>\nwhich is the number of different permutations possible. The division by {{math|''C''}} neatly corrects the overcounting that occurs in the integral over all phase space.\n\nIt is of course possible to include distinguishable ''types'' of particles in the grand canonical ensemble\u2014each distinguishable type <math>i</math> is tracked by a separate particle counter <math>N_i</math> and chemical potential <math>\\mu_i</math>. As a result, the only consistent way to include \"fully distinguishable\" particles in the grand canonical ensemble is to consider every possible distinguishable type of those particles, and to track each and every possible type with a separate particle counter and separate chemical potential.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Statistical mechanics topics}}\n\n[[Category:Statistical ensembles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Statistical ensemble of particles in thermodynamic equilibrium}}{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=Ensembles}}\n\nIn [[statistical mechanics]], a '''grand canonical ensemble''' (also known as the macrocanonical ensemble) is the [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] that is used to represent the possible states of a mechanical system of particles that are in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] (thermal and chemical) with a reservoir.<ref name=\"gibbs\">{{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Josiah Willard |authorlink=Josiah Willard Gibbs |title=Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics |year=1902 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York|title-link=Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics }}</ref> The system is said to be open in the sense that the system can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir, so that various possible states of the system can differ in both their total energy and total number of particles. The system's volume, shape, and other external coordinates are kept the same in all possible states of the system.\n\nThe thermodynamic variables of the grand canonical ensemble are [[chemical potential]] (symbol: {{math|''\u00b5''}}) and [[absolute temperature]] (symbol: {{math|''T''}}). The ensemble is also dependent on mechanical variables such as volume (symbol: {{math|''V''}}) which influence the nature of the system's internal states. This ensemble is therefore sometimes called the ''' {{math|''\u00b5VT''}} ensemble''', as each of these three quantities are constants of the ensemble.\n\n== Basics ==\n\nIn simple terms, the grand canonical ensemble assigns a probability {{math|''P''}} to each distinct [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] given by the following exponential:\n:<math>P = e^{\\frac{\\Omega + \\mu N - E}{k T}},</math>\nwhere {{math|''N''}} is the number of particles in the microstate and {{math|''E''}} is the total energy of the microstate. {{math|''k''}} is [[Boltzmann's constant]].\n\nThe number {{math|\u03a9}} is known as the [[grand potential]] and is constant for the ensemble. However, the probabilities and {{math|\u03a9}} will vary if different {{math|''\u00b5'', ''V'', ''T''}} are selected. The grand potential {{math|\u03a9}} serves two roles: to provide a normalization factor for the probability distribution (the probabilities, over the complete set of microstates, must add up to one); and, many important ensemble averages can be directly calculated from the function {{math|\u03a9(''\u00b5'', ''V'', ''T'')}}.\n\nIn the case where more than one kind of particle is allowed to vary in number, the probability expression generalizes to\n:<math>P = e^{\\frac{\\Omega + \\mu_1 N_1 + \\mu_2 N_2 + \\ldots + \\mu_s N_s - E}{k T}},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u00b5''<sub>1</sub>}} is the chemical potential for the first kind of particles, {{math|''N''<sub>1</sub>}} is the number of that kind of particle in the microstate, {{math|''\u00b5''<sub>2</sub>}} is the chemical potential for the second kind of particles and so on ({{math|''s''}} is the number of distinct kinds of particles). However, these particle numbers should be defined carefully (see the [[#Requirement of particle number conservation|note on particle number conservation]] below).\n\nGrand ensembles are apt for use when describing systems such as the [[electron]]s in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], or the [[photons]] in a cavity, where the shape is fixed but the energy and number of particles can easily fluctuate due to contact with a reservoir (e.g., an electrical ground or a [[black body|dark surface]], in these cases). The grand canonical ensemble provides a natural setting for an exact derivation of the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] or [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] for a system of non-interacting quantum particles (see examples below).\n\n; Note on formulation\n: An alternative formulation for the same concept writes the probability as <math>\\textstyle P = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal Z} e^{(\\mu N-E)/(k T)}</math>, using the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|grand partition function]] <math>\\textstyle \\mathcal Z = e^{-\\Omega/(k T)}</math> rather than the grand potential. The equations in this article (in terms of grand potential) may be restated in terms of the grand partition function by simple mathematical manipulations.\n\n==Applicability==\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble is the ensemble that describes the possible states of an isolated system that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir (the derivation proceeds along lines analogous to the heat bath derivation of the normal [[canonical ensemble]], and can be found in Reif<ref name=\"Reif\">{{cite book | last = Reif | first = F. | title = Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics | publisher = McGraw\u2013Hill | year = 1965 | isbn = 9780070518001 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofst00fred }}</ref>). The grand canonical ensemble applies to systems of any size, small or large; it is only necessary to assume that the reservoir with which it is in contact is much larger (i.e., to take the [[macroscopic limit]]).\n\nThe condition that the system is isolated is necessary in order to ensure it has well-defined thermodynamic quantities and evolution.<ref name=\"gibbs\"/> In practice, however, it is desirable to apply the grand canonical ensemble to describe systems that are in direct contact with the reservoir, since it is that contact that ensures the equilibrium. The use of the grand canonical ensemble in these cases is usually justified either 1) by assuming that the contact is weak, or 2) by incorporating a part of the reservoir connection into the system under analysis, so that the connection's influence on the region of interest is correctly modeled. Alternatively, theoretical approaches can be used to model the influence of the connection, yielding an [[open statistical ensemble]].\n\nAnother case in which the grand canonical ensemble appears is when considering a system that is large and thermodynamic (a system that is \"in equilibrium with itself\"). Even if the exact conditions of the system do not actually allow for variations in energy or particle number, the grand canonical ensemble can be used to simplify calculations of some thermodynamic properties. The reason for this is that various thermodynamic ensembles ([[microcanonical ensemble|microcanonical]], [[canonical ensemble|canonical]]) become equivalent in some aspects to the grand canonical ensemble, once the system is very large.<ref group=note>To quote Reif, \"For purposes of calculating mean values of physical quantities, it makes no noticeable difference whether a macroscopic system is isolated, or in contact with a reservoir with which it can only exchange energy, or in contact with a reservoir with which it can exchange both energy and particles. [...] In some problems where the constraint of a fixed number of particles is cumbersome, one can thus readily circumvent the complication by approximating the actual situation with [...] the grand canonical distribution.\"</ref> Of course, for small systems, the different ensembles are no longer equivalent even in the mean.

Focusing on just one orbital labelled {{math|''i''}}, the total energy for a [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] of {{math|''N''}} particles in this orbital will be {{math|''N\u03f5''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, where {{math|''\u03f5''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is the characteristic energy level of that orbital.

We again consider placing multiple particles of the same kind into the same microstate of single-particle phase space, which we again call an \"orbital\". However, compared to quantum mechanics, the classical case is complicated by the fact that a microstate in classical mechanics does not refer to a single point in phase space but rather to an extended region in phase space: one microstate contains an infinite number of states, all distinct but of similar character. As a result, when multiple particles are placed into the same orbital, the overall collection of the particles (in the system phase space) does not count as one whole microstate but rather only a ''fraction'' of a microstate, because identical states (formed by permutation of identical particles) should not be overcounted. The overcounting correction factor is the [[factorial]] of the number of particles.\n\nThe statistics in this case take the form of an exponential power series\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Omega_{\\rm orb} & = -kT \\ln \\Big( \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{N!} e^{\\frac{N\\mu - N\\epsilon_{\\rm orb}}{k T}}\\Big) \\\\\n & = -kT \\ln \\Big( e^{e^{\\frac{\\mu - \\epsilon_{\\rm orb}}{k T}}}\\Big) \\\\\n & = - kT e^{\\frac{\\mu - \\epsilon_{\\rm orb}}{k T}},\n\\end{align}</math>\nthe value <math>\\scriptstyle\\langle N_{\\rm orb}\\rangle = -\\tfrac{\\partial \\Omega_{\\rm orb}}{\\partial \\mu}</math> corresponding to [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics]].\n\n===Ionization of an isolated atom===\n\n[[File:Surface ionization of cesium.svg|thumb|Surface ionization effect in a vaporized [[cesium]] atom at 1500 K, calculated using the method in this section (also including [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]]).

At room temperature this situation is not stable since the atom tends to [[adsorb]] to the exposed lining of the box instead of floating freely. At high temperatures, however, the atoms are evaporated from the surface in ionic form; this spontaneous [[surface ionization]] effect has been used as a cesium [[ion source]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Alton | first1 = G.

Though not strictly in equilibrium, it may be useful to name quasi-equilibrium chemical potentials which can differ among the different populations. Examples: ([[semiconductor physics]]) distinct [[quasi-Fermi level]]s (electron chemical potentials) in the [[conduction band]] and [[valence band]]; ([[spintronic]]s) distinct spin-up and spin-down chemical potentials; ([[cryogenic]]s) distinct [[parahydrogen]] and [[orthohydrogen]] chemical potentials.\n\n==Precise expressions for the ensemble==\n\nThe precise mathematical expression for statistical ensembles has a distinct form depending on the type of mechanics under consideration (quantum or classical), as the notion of a \"microstate\" is considerably different. In quantum mechanics, the grand canonical ensemble affords a simple description since diagonalization provides a set of distinct [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s of a system, each with well-defined energy and particle number. The classical mechanical case is more complex as it involves not stationary states but instead an integral over canonical [[phase space]].\n\n=== Quantum mechanical ===\n\n{{details|topic=the representation of ensembles in quantum mechanics|Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)}}\n\nA statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a [[density matrix]], denoted by <math>\\hat \\rho</math>. The grand canonical ensemble is the density matrix{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n:<math>\\hat \\rho = \\exp\\big(\\tfrac{1}{kT}(\\Omega + \\mu_1 \\hat N_1 + \\ldots + \\mu_s \\hat N_s - \\hat H)\\big),</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u0124''}} is the system's total energy operator ([[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>1</sub>}} is the system's total [[particle number operator]] for particles of type 1, {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>2</sub>}} is the total [[particle number operator]] for particles of type 2, and so on. {{math|exp}} is the [[matrix exponential]] operator. The grand potential {{math|\u03a9}} is determined by the probability normalization condition that the density matrix has a [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of one, <math> Tr \\hat \\rho = 1</math>:\n:<math>e^{-\\frac{\\Omega}{k T}} = \\operatorname{Tr} \\exp\\big(\\tfrac{1}{kT}(\\mu_1 \\hat N_1 + \\ldots + \\mu_s \\hat N_s - \\hat H)\\big).</math>\n\nNote that for the grand ensemble, the basis states of the operators {{math|''\u0124''}}, {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>1</sub>}}, etc. are all states with ''multiple particles'' in [[Fock space]], and the density matrix is defined on the same basis. Since the energy and particle numbers are all separately conserved, these operators are mutually commuting.\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble can alternatively be written in a simple form using [[bra\u2013ket notation]], since it is possible (given the mutually commuting nature of the energy and particle number operators) to find a complete  [[simultaneous diagonalization|basis of simultaneous eigenstates]] {{math|{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9}}, indexed by {{math|''i''}}, where {{math|''\u0124''{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9 {{=}} ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9}}, {{math|''N\u0302''<sub>1</sub>{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9 {{=}} ''N''<sub>1,''i''</sub>{{!}}''\u03c8''<sub>''i''</sub>\u27e9}}, and so on. Given such an eigenbasis, the grand canonical ensemble is simply\n:<math>\\hat \\rho = \\sum_i e^{\\frac{\\Omega + \\mu_1 N_{1,i} + \\ldots + \\mu_s N_{s,i} - E_i}{k T}} |\\psi_i\\rangle \\langle \\psi_i | </math>\n:<math>e^{-\\frac{\\Omega}{k T}} = \\sum_i e^{\\frac{\\mu_1 N_{1,i} + \\ldots + \\mu_s N_{s,i} - E_i}{k T}}.</math>\nwhere the sum is over the complete set of states with state {{math|''i''}} having {{math|''E''<sub>''i''</sub>}} total energy, {{math|''N''<sub>1,''i''</sub>}} particles of type 1, {{math|''N''<sub>2,''i''</sub>}} particles of type 2, and so on.\n\n===Classical mechanical===\n\n{{details|topic=the representation of ensembles in classical mechanics|Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)}}\n\nIn classical mechanics, a grand ensemble is instead represented by a [[joint probability density function]] defined over multiple [[phase space]]s of varying dimensions, {{math|''\u03c1''(''N''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''N''<sub>''s''</sub>, ''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''q''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''q''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where the {{math|''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and {{math|''q''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026 ''q''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are the [[canonical coordinates]] (generalized momenta and generalized coordinates) of the system's internal degrees of freedom.

In the system's equation of motion each particle is forever tracked as a distinguishable entity, and yet there are also valid states of the system where the positions of each particle have simply been swapped: these states are represented at different places in phase space, yet would seem to be equivalent.\n\nIf the permutations of similar particles are regarded to count as distinct states, then the factor {{math|''C''}} above is simply {{math|''C'' {{=}} 1}}. From this point of view, ensembles include every permuted state as a separate microstate. Although appearing benign at first, this leads to a problem of severely non-extensive entropy in the canonical ensemble, known today as the [[Gibbs paradox]]. In the grand canonical ensemble a further logical inconsistency occurs: the number of distinguishable permutations depends not only on how many particles are in the system, but also on how many particles are in the reservoir (since the system may exchange particles with a reservoir). In this case the entropy and chemical potential are non-extensive but also badly defined, depending on a parameter (reservoir size) that should be irrelevant.\n\nTo solve these issues it is necessary that the exchange of two similar particles (within the system, or between the system and reservoir) must not be regarded as giving a distinct state of the system.<ref name=\"gibbs\"/><ref group=note>This can be compared to the [[canonical ensemble]] where it is optional to consider particles as distinguishable; this only gives {{math|''N''}}-dependent error in entropy, which is unobservable as long as {{math|''N''}} is kept constant. In general, however, there is no such freedom: \"when the number of particles in a system is to be treated as variable, the average index of probability for phases generically defined corresponds to entropy.\" (Gibbs).</ref> In order to incorporate this fact, integrals are still carried over full phase space but the result is divided by\n:<math>C = N_1! N_2! \\ldots N_s!,</math>\nwhich is the number of different permutations possible. The division by {{math|''C''}} neatly corrects the overcounting that occurs in the integral over all phase space.\n\nIt is of course possible to include distinguishable ''types'' of particles in the grand canonical ensemble\u2014each distinguishable type <math>i</math> is tracked by a separate particle counter <math>N_i</math> and chemical potential <math>\\mu_i</math>. As a result, the only consistent way to include \"fully distinguishable\" particles in the grand canonical ensemble is to consider every possible distinguishable type of those particles, and to track each and every possible type with a separate particle counter and separate chemical potential.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Statistical mechanics topics}}\n\n[[Category:Statistical ensembles]]\n", "name_user": "AkanoToE", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eQuantum mechanical:Fixed broken link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_canonical_ensemble"}
