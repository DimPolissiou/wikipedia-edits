Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog fighter that does battle with numerous brutal opponents, and wins the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] twice. The last two entries in the series are  ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' and ''[[Creed II]]'', that serve as spin-off films focusing on [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed]], the son of the ill-fated boxer [[Apollo Creed]], to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor.

His use of the front entrance to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the ''Rocky'' series led the area to be nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]], and [[Philadelphia]] has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum.

That same year, he starred in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modelled on [[James Hoffa]], who becomes involved in the labor union leadership.

Critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. Three Rambo sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008), and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019) followed. He also continued his box office success with the ''Rocky'' franchise and wrote, directed, and starred in two more 1980s sequels to the series: ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of eleven films. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen, which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit-ups in the evenings.

These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic [[Roger Ebert]]. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989), the latter alongside [[Kurt Russell]], did solid business domestically and blockbuster business overseas, grossing over {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over {{US$|160}}&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nStallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''.

Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over {{US$|158}}&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over {{US$|170}}&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of {{US$|113}}&nbsp;million. He also appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. In 1996, he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]''.\n\nThat same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film \"[[Your Studio and You]]\" commissioned by the [[Seagram]] Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him \"brainiac.\" In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Stupid cheap studio!\"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you] (From Google Video) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020045255/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''.

Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films ''[[Driven (2001 film)|Driven]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenging Angelo]]'' (2002) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002) were also critical and commercial failures. In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the ''[[Spy Kids (film series)|Spy Kids]]'' series: ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'', which was a huge box office success (almost {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million worldwide).

arriving to [[New York City]] in 1969 and later [[Hollywood]] in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/lords-of-flatbush/|title=45 Years Ago: 'The Lords of Flatbush' Introduces Rocky and Fonzie|first=Michael|last=Christopher|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\nStallone mostly only found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizeable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor, starting in 1976 with his self-created role as the boxer [[Rocky Balboa]], in the first film of the successful [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' series]] (1976\u20132018). In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog fighter that does battle with numerous brutal opponents, and wins the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] twice. The last two entries in the series are  ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' and ''[[Creed II]]'', that serve as spin-off films focusing on [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed]], the son of the ill-fated boxer [[Apollo Creed]], to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role during the 2010s brought Stallone praise, and his first [[Golden Globe]] award for the first ''Creed'', as well as a third [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/golden-globes/2016/01/12/golden-globes-sylvester-stallone-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-apology/|title=Sylvester Stallone says he owes 'Creed' team 'everything' after Globes omission|website=EW.com}}</ref>\n\nStallone had similar box-office success, portraying the [[PTSD]] plagued soldier [[John Rambo]] in the five [[Rambo (film series)|''Rambo'' films]] (1982\u20132019) and as mercenary [[List of characters from The Expendables film series#Barney Ross|Barney Ross]] in the three [[The Expendables (film series)|''The Expendables'' films]] (2010\u20132014). He wrote or co-wrote most of the films in his three biggest franchises, and directed many of them.\n\nStallone's film ''[[Rocky]]'' was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]], and had its props placed in the [[Smithsonian Museum]]. His use of the front entrance to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the ''Rocky'' series led the area to be nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]], and [[Philadelphia]] has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. It was announced on December 7, 2010 that he was voted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in the non-participant category.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/sylvester-stallone-hall-of-famer-1.2523881 |title=Sylvester Stallone, hall of famer |date=December 7, 2010 |work=Newsday |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211122730/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/sylvester-stallone-hall-of-famer-1.2523881 |archivedate=December 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Stallone was nominated for two Academy Awards for ''Rocky'', for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

The film was re-cut and retitled ''Rebel'' years later, this second version featuring Stallone as its star. After the style of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'', this film, in 1990, was re-edited from [[outtake]]s from the original movie and newly shot matching footage, then [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|redubbed]] into an award-winning parody of itself titled ''A Man Called...

Critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. Three Rambo sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008), and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019) followed. He also continued his box office success with the ''Rocky'' franchise and wrote, directed, and starred in two more 1980s sequels to the series: ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of eleven films. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen, which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit-ups in the evenings.

These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic [[Roger Ebert]]. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989), the latter alongside [[Kurt Russell]], did solid business domestically and blockbuster business overseas, grossing over {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over {{US$|160}}&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nStallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''.

Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over {{US$|158}}&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over {{US$|170}}&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of {{US$|113}}&nbsp;million. He also appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. In 1996, he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]''.\n\nThat same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film \"[[Your Studio and You]]\" commissioned by the [[Seagram]] Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him \"brainiac.\" In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Stupid cheap studio!\"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you] (From Google Video) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020045255/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''.

Once he acquired his [[Brevet de Technicien Sup\u00e9rieur|BTS]], he was temporarily employed in a musical publishing house as an operator input, an experience which he didn't enjoy. It was during that time, on 1 March 2012, that he created the show ''What The Cut !?''.\n\n==YouTube==\n===''What The Cut !?''===\n''What The Cut !?'' was a humoristic show created by Antoine Daniel, the first episode of \"What The Cut !?\" was uploaded on 1 March 2012 on his YouTube channel. The concept of the show comes from [[Ray William Johnson]]'s ''Equals Three''. When it comes to his humor and staging inspirations, his most obvious references are videographer [[TomSka]] and British director [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nIn each episode of ''What The Cut !?'', Antoine Daniel analyses three funny, strange or freaky videos, and jokingly comments on them. However, ''What The Cut !?'' isn't a French \"Equals Three\" as Antoine Daniel completely changed the concept.

Once he acquired his [[Brevet de Technicien Sup\u00e9rieur|BTS]], he was temporarily employed in a musical publishing house as an operator input, an experience which he didn't enjoy. It was during that time, on 1 March 2012, that he created the show ''What The Cut !?''.\n\n==YouTube==\n===''What The Cut !?''===\n''What The Cut !?'' was a humoristic show created by Antoine Daniel, the first episode of \"What The Cut !?\" was uploaded on 1 March 2012 on his YouTube channel. The concept of the show comes from [[Ray William Johnson]]'s ''Equals Three''. When it comes to his humor and staging inspirations, his most obvious references are videographer [[TomSka]] and British director [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nIn each episode of ''What The Cut !?'', Antoine Daniel analyses three funny, strange or freaky videos, and jokingly comments on them. However, ''What The Cut !?'' isn't a French \"Equals Three\" as Antoine Daniel completely changed the concept. In ''What The Cut !?'' he plays a character who speaks very quickly, wildly and sometimes screams. The video editing is very quick and the jokes are completely absurd which explains the show's name : \"What the ...\" for the absurd, wacky and crazy jokes and humor, and \"Cut\", for the video editing, which Antoine Daniel considers the most important part of his videos.\n\n===''Clyde Vanilla''===\n{{Expand section|date=September 2017}}\n''Clyde Vanilla'' is a [[science fiction]] [[Audiobook|audio story]].

S. Amudhan]] and produced by [[S. Sashikanth]]. A sequel to the successful ''[[Thamizh Padam]]'' (2010), the film stars [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]], [[Sathish]], [[Disha Pandey]], and [[Iswarya Menon]]. The music was composed by [[Kannan (music director)|Kannan]] with cinematography by [[Gopi Amarnath]] and editing by [[T. S. Suresh]]. The film released on 13 July 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nShiva, the universal cop, has left the police department and has returned to his hometown of Cinemapatti(Shiva's village). He is brought back in to resolve a crisis. Once the situation is handled, he is asked to join the department by [[Police Commissioner]] Yezhusaamy, but he refuses and walks away. P, a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, kills Shiva's wife Priya by using a cell phone bomb. Shiva is forced to rejoin the police department. Meanwhile, Shiva is finding a girl to marry on his grandmother's request. His conditions for a girl are that he wants a [[loosu ponnu]] (a bubbly but crazy girl). He sees Ramya and assumes that she is crazy since she went into a mental hospital van. With the help of his friends, he proposes to her, and she agrees his love.\n\nShiva learns that P has fixed a bomb somewhere by the clues which were given by P's henchman Wasim Khan. Shiva finds that P has fixed a bomb in a bus. He comes to know that P has fixed the bomb such that if the bus is driven less or more than five kilometers per hour, it will explode. However, Shiva saves the people inside the bus. Wasim is killed by Ritika, P's henchwoman. Shiva then discovers that there was someone in the department who is informing P about their ideas. He discovers and kills Inbashekhar, the mole, and is seemingly suspended.\n\nShiva realizes that Ramya is not crazy but a [[ psychiatrist]], and breaks up with her. His friends advise him that he needs to reunite with her. He decides to, but Ramya has left for America. Shiva also goes there to find her, and they reunite in [[Central Park]]. Then, it is revealed that Shiva went on a mission in America so that he could catch P, and that he was not suspended. When the mission is in progress, Ramya is kidnapped and killed by P. Back in Chennai, Shiva is very sad about Ramya's death. His grandmother asks him to take her to the cemetery. She took some promises which were to kill P, marry a beautiful girl than Ramya(the girl he loved and which died), and to give her a grandson.\n\nShiva sketches a plan to catch P by [[Legal tender#Demonetization|demonetising]] 500 and 1000 rupee notes with the help of the government. He goes to a temple to attend his friend Bharath's marriage. There, he meets Gayathri, a lookalike of Ramya, and gets shocked. He proposes to her in the next two minutes when he sees her. The demonetisation forces P to stand at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] queue because he had a lakh crores of 1000 rupee notes. Shiva executes his plan perfectly, but P escapes. Shiva catches him at his Kovalam [[beach resort]]. He kills him, but P comes alive and becomes the [[Chief Minister|CM]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n\nBodhi, a saint, calls Shiva and says that P is [[immortality|immortal]]. The enmity between P and Shiva is for 76 generations. In 300 [[Before Christ|BC]], King Adhiyamaan was ruling Kovai. He appointed Piyaar as the dance teacher of the kingdom, but his dance was demonic. Bharathamuni, another dancer whose dance was divine, wanted to do a [[Competitive dance|dance-off]] with Piyaar. Adhiyamaan also said that the winner will get a [[jackfruit]], which will give immortality to the one who eats it, and also his daughter Khaleesi will marry him, but Piyaar's henchmen kill Bharathamuni and his grandmother. As a result, Piyaar gets the jackfruit and becomes immortal.\n\nNow, Shiva needs to go to 1492 BC to win the dance-off with Piyaar. He gets a [[time travel]] watch from a watch mechanic. He goes to 1492 BC, wins the dance-off, Khaleesi, and the jackfruit. He then comes back to 2018, and meets P, who kidnapped Gayathri. He reveals that he ate the jackfruit, and P is no longer immortal. He fights with his henchmen while Gayathri sings. Irritated by her singing, P kills her. Shiva also kills P and is arrested.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Shiva is released from prison after 25 years, but his grandmother kills him, showing her villainous \"D\" nature, albeit being acquitted in the first film.\n\n== Cast  ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Shiva, the universal cop and Barathamuni, a dancer in 300 BC who loses the dance-off to Piyaar\n* [[Sathish]] as P (Pandiya), a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, and Piyaar, the dance teacher of Kovai who wins a dance-off against Barathamuni\n* [[Disha Pandey]] as Priya, Shiva's wife who gets killed by P\n* [[Iswarya Menon]] as Ramya, a psychologist whom Shiva falls in love with; Gayathri, Ramya's lookalike; and Khaleesi, Adhiyamaan's daughter\n* [[Kalairani]] (replacing [[Paravai Muniyamma]] from the first film) as Shiva's grandmother (D) and Barathamuni's grandmother \n* [[Santhana Bharathi]] (replacing [[M.

S. Amudhan]] and produced by [[S. Sashikanth]]. A sequel to the successful ''[[Thamizh Padam]]'' (2010), the film stars [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]], [[Sathish]], [[Disha Pandey]], and [[Iswarya Menon]]. The music was composed by [[Kannan (music director)|Kannan]] with cinematography by [[Gopi Amarnath]] and editing by [[T. S. Suresh]]. The film released on 13 July 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nShiva, the universal cop, has left the police department and has returned to his hometown of Cinemapatti(Shiva's village). He is brought back in to resolve a crisis. Once the situation is handled, he is asked to join the department by [[Police Commissioner]] Yezhusaamy, but he refuses and walks away. P, a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, kills Shiva's wife Priya by using a cell phone bomb. Shiva is forced to rejoin the police department. Meanwhile, Shiva is finding a girl to marry on his grandmother's request. His conditions for a girl are that he wants a [[loosu ponnu]] (a bubbly but crazy girl). He sees Ramya and assumes that she is crazy since she went into a mental hospital van. With the help of his friends, he proposes to her, and she agrees his love.\n\nShiva learns that P has fixed a bomb somewhere by the clues which were given by P's henchman Wasim Khan. Shiva finds that P has fixed a bomb in a bus. He comes to know that P has fixed the bomb such that if the bus is driven less or more than five kilometers per hour, it will explode. However, Shiva saves the people inside the bus. Wasim is killed by Ritika, P's henchwoman. Shiva then discovers that there was someone in the department who is informing P about their ideas. He discovers and kills Inbashekhar, the mole, and is seemingly suspended.\n\nShiva realizes that Ramya is not crazy but a [[ psychiatrist]], and breaks up with her. His friends advise him that he needs to reunite with her. He decides to, but Ramya has left for America. Shiva also goes there to find her, and they reunite in [[Central Park]]. Then, it is revealed that Shiva went on a mission in America so that he could catch P, and that he was not suspended. When the mission is in progress, Ramya is kidnapped and killed by P. Back in Chennai, Shiva is very sad about Ramya's death. His grandmother asks him to take her to the cemetery. She took some promises which were to kill P, marry a beautiful girl than Ramya(the girl he loved and which died), and to give her a grandson.\n\nShiva sketches a plan to catch P by [[Legal tender#Demonetization|demonetising]] 500 and 1000 rupee notes with the help of the government. He goes to a temple to attend his friend Bharath's marriage. There, he meets Gayathri, a lookalike of Ramya, and gets shocked. He proposes to her in the next two minutes when he sees her. The demonetisation forces P to stand at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] queue because he had a lakh crores of 1000 rupee notes. Shiva executes his plan perfectly, but P escapes. Shiva catches him at his Kovalam [[beach resort]]. He kills him, but P comes alive and becomes the [[Chief Minister|CM]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n\nBodhi, a saint, calls Shiva and says that P is [[immortality|immortal]]. The enmity between P and Shiva is for 76 generations. In 300 [[Before Christ|BC]], King Adhiyamaan was ruling Kovai. He appointed Piyaar as the dance teacher of the kingdom, but his dance was demonic. Bharathamuni, another dancer whose dance was divine, wanted to do a [[Competitive dance|dance-off]] with Piyaar. Adhiyamaan also said that the winner will get a [[jackfruit]], which will give immortality to the one who eats it, and also his daughter Khaleesi will marry him, but Piyaar's henchmen kill Bharathamuni and his grandmother. As a result, Piyaar gets the jackfruit and becomes immortal.\n\nNow, Shiva needs to go to 1492 BC to win the dance-off with Piyaar. He gets a [[time travel]] watch from a watch mechanic. He goes to 1492 BC, wins the dance-off, Khaleesi, and the jackfruit. He then comes back to 2018, and meets P, who kidnapped Gayathri. He reveals that he ate the jackfruit, and P is no longer immortal. He fights with his henchmen while Gayathri sings. Irritated by her singing, P kills her. Shiva also kills P and is arrested.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Shiva is released from prison after 25 years, but his grandmother kills him, showing her villainous \"D\" nature, albeit being acquitted in the first film.\n\n== Cast  ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Shiva, the universal cop and Barathamuni, a dancer in 300 BC who loses the dance-off to Piyaar\n* [[Sathish]] as P (Pandiya), a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, and Piyaar, the dance teacher of Kovai who wins a dance-off against Barathamuni\n* [[Disha Pandey]] as Priya, Shiva's wife who gets killed by P\n* [[Iswarya Menon]] as Ramya, a psychologist whom Shiva falls in love with; Gayathri, Ramya's lookalike; and Khaleesi, Adhiyamaan's daughter\n* [[Kalairani]] (replacing [[Paravai Muniyamma]] from the first film) as Shiva's grandmother (D) and Barathamuni's grandmother \n* [[Santhana Bharathi]] (replacing [[M.

By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shepard |first=James |date=1913 |title=Connecticut Soldiers in the Pequot War of 1637 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=etas |location=Meriden, Conn. |publisher=The Journal Publishing Co.}}</ref> [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

[[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.
