At the frequencies of each vibrating mode, waves travel in both directions along the string or air column, reinforcing and canceling each other to form [[standing wave]]s. Interaction with the surrounding air causes audible [[sound waves]], which travel away from the instrument. Because of the typical spacing of the [[resonance]]s, these frequencies are mostly limited to integer multiples, or [[harmonic]]s, of the lowest frequency, and such multiples form the harmonic series (see [[harmonic series (mathematics)]]).\n\nThe musical [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a note is usually perceived as the lowest [[#Partial|partial]] present (the fundamental frequency), which may be the one created by [[vibration]] over the full length of the string or air column, or a higher harmonic chosen by the player. The musical [[timbre]] of a steady tone from such an instrument is strongly affected by the relative strength of each harmonic.\n\n== Terminology {{anchor|Partial}} ==\n\n===Partial, harmonic, fundamental, inharmonicity, and overtone===\n\nA \"complex tone\" (the sound of a note with a timbre particular to the instrument playing the note) \"can be described as a combination of many simple periodic waves (i.e., [[sine wave]]s) or ''partials,'' each with its own frequency of vibration, amplitude, and [[Phase (waves)|phase]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Music, Thought, and Feeling: Understanding the Psychology of Music|author=[[William Forde Thompson]]|isbn=978-0-19-537707-1|page=46|year=2008|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/CognitivePsychology/?view=usa&ci=9780195377071}}</ref> (See also, [[Fourier analysis]].)\n\nA '''''partial''''' is any of the sine waves (or \"simple tones\", as Ellis calls them when translating Helmholtz) of which a complex tone is composed, not necessarily with an integer multiple of the lowest harmonic.\n\nA '''''harmonic''''' is any member of the harmonic series, an ideal set of frequencies that are positive integer multiples of a common [[fundamental frequency]]. The '''''fundamental''''' is obviously a harmonic because it is 1 times itself. A '''''harmonic partial''''' is any real partial component of a complex tone that matches (or nearly matches) an ideal harmonic.<ref>{{cite book | title = Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound | author = [[John R.

''[[Inharmonicity]]'' is a measure of the deviation of a partial from the closest ideal harmonic, typically measured in [[cent (music)|cents]] for each partial.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Historical Harpsichord Volume Two: The Metallurgy of 17th- and 18th- Century Music Wire | author = [[Martha Goodway]] and Jay Scott Odell | publisher = Pendragon Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-918728-54-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sE1mk8ed1dkC&pg=PA93&dq=inharmonicity+defined+partial+frequencies}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Definite pitch|pitched]] acoustic instruments are designed to have partials that are close to being whole-number ratios with very low inharmonicity; therefore, in music theory, and in instrument design, it is convenient, although not strictly accurate, to speak of the partials in those instruments' sounds as \"harmonics\", even though they may have some degree of inharmonicity. The [[piano]], one of the most important instruments of western tradition, contains a certain degree of inharmonicity among the frequencies generated by each string. Other pitched instruments, especially certain [[percussion]] instruments, such as [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]], [[tubular bell]]s, [[timpani]], and [[singing bowl]]s contain mostly inharmonic partials, yet may give the ear a good sense of pitch because of a few strong partials that resemble harmonics. Unpitched, or indefinite-pitched instruments, such as cymbals and tam-tams make sounds (produce spectra) that are rich in inharmonic partials and may give no impression of implying any particular pitch.\n\nAn '''''[[overtone]]''''' is any partial above the lowest partial. The term overtone does not imply harmonicity or inharmonicity and has no other special meaning other than to exclude the fundamental. It is mostly the relative strength of the different overtones that give an instrument its particular timbre, tone color, or character. When writing or speaking of overtones and partials numerically, care must be taken to designate each correctly to avoid any confusion of one for the other, so the second overtone may not be the third partial, because it is the second sound in a series.<ref>{{harvnb|Riemann|1896|p=143}}: \"let it be understood, the second overtone is not the third tone of the series, but the second\"</ref>\n \nSome electronic instruments, such as [[synthesizer]]s, can play a pure frequency with no overtones (a sine wave). Synthesizers can also combine pure frequencies into more complex tones, such as to simulate other instruments. Certain flutes and ocarinas are very nearly without overtones.\n\n==Frequencies, wavelengths, and musical intervals in example systems==\n[[File:Harmonic series to 32.png|250px|thumb|Even-numbered string harmonics from 2nd up to the 64th (5&nbsp;octaves).]]\nOne of the simplest cases to visualise is a vibrating string, as in the illustration; the string has fixed points at each end, and each harmonic [[normal mode|mode]] divides it into 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., equal-sized sections resonating at increasingly higher frequencies.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Physics and Psychophysics of Music |first=Juan G. |last=Roederer |isbn=0-387-94366-8 |page=106 |year=1995 }}</ref> Similar arguments apply to vibrating air columns in wind instruments (for example, \"the French horn was originally a valveless instrument that could play only the notes of the harmonic series\"<ref>{{cite book |author1=Kostka, Stefan |author2=Payne, Dorothy |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Tonal Harmony |page=102 |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |ISBN=0-07-035874-5}}</ref>), although these are complicated by having the possibility of anti-nodes (that is, the air column is closed at one end and open at the other), [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] as opposed to [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]]s, or end-openings that run the gamut from no flare, cone flare, or exponentially shaped flares (such as in various bells).\n\nIn most pitched musical instruments, the fundamental (first harmonic) is accompanied by other, higher-frequency harmonics. Thus shorter-wavelength, higher-frequency [[wave]]s occur with varying prominence and give each instrument its characteristic tone quality. The fact that a string is fixed at each end means that the longest allowed wavelength on the string (which gives the fundamental frequency) is twice the length of the string (one round trip, with a half cycle fitting between the nodes at the two ends). Other allowed  wavelengths are {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|5}}, {{frac|1|6}}, etc. times that of the fundamental.\n\nTheoretically, these shorter wavelengths correspond to [[vibrations]] at frequencies that are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., times the fundamental frequency. Physical characteristics of the vibrating medium and/or the resonator it vibrates against often alter these frequencies. (See [[inharmonicity]] and [[stretched tuning]] for alterations specific to wire-stringed instruments and certain electric pianos.) However, those alterations are small, and except for precise, highly specialized tuning, it is reasonable to think of the frequencies of the harmonic series as integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nThe harmonic series is an [[arithmetic series]] (1\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 2\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 3\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 4\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 5\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, ...). In terms of frequency (measured in cycles per second, or [[hertz]] (Hz) where {{mvar|f}} is the fundamental frequency), the difference between consecutive harmonics is therefore constant and equal to the fundamental. But because human ears respond to sound nonlinearly, higher harmonics are perceived as \"closer together\" than lower ones. On the other hand, the [[octave]] series is a [[geometric progression]] (2\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 4\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 8\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 16\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, ...), and people perceive these distances as \"the same\" in the sense of musical interval. In terms of what one hears, each octave in the harmonic series is divided into increasingly \"smaller\" and more numerous intervals.\n\nThe second harmonic, whose frequency is twice of the fundamental, sounds an octave higher; the third harmonic, three times the frequency of the fundamental, sounds a [[perfect fifth]] above the second harmonic. The fourth harmonic vibrates at four times the frequency of the fundamental and sounds a [[perfect fourth]] above the third harmonic (two octaves above the fundamental). Double the harmonic number means double the frequency (which sounds an octave higher).\n\n<!--image shown wider than 400px to display detail-->\n[[Image:Harmonic Series.png|thumb|center|650px|An illustration in musical notation of the harmonic series (on C) up to the 20th&nbsp;harmonic.

This objective structure is augmented by psychoacoustic phenomena. For example, a perfect fifth, say 200 and 300&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second), causes a listener to perceive a [[combination tone]] of 100&nbsp;Hz (the difference between 300&nbsp;Hz and 200&nbsp;Hz); that is, an octave below the lower (actual sounding) note. This 100&nbsp;Hz first-order combination tone then interacts with both notes of the interval to produce second-order combination tones of 200 (300&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;100) and 100 (200&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;100) Hz and all further nth-order combination tones are all the same, being formed from various subtraction of 100, 200, and 300. When one contrasts this with a dissonant interval such as a [[tritone]](not tempered) with a frequency ratio of 7:5 one gets, for example, 700&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;500&nbsp;=&nbsp;200 (1st order combination tone) and 500&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;200&nbsp;=&nbsp;300 (2nd order). The rest of the combination tones are octaves of 100&nbsp;Hz so the 7:5 interval actually contains 4&nbsp;notes: 100&nbsp;Hz (and its octaves), 300&nbsp;Hz, 500&nbsp;Hz and 700&nbsp;Hz. Note that the lowest combination tone (100&nbsp;Hz) is a 17th (2&nbsp;octaves and a [[major third]]) below the lower (actual sounding) note of the [[tritone]]. All the intervals succumb to similar analysis as has been demonstrated by [[Paul Hindemith]] in his book ''The Craft of Musical Composition'', although he rejected the use of harmonics from the 7th and beyond.<ref name=\"Hindemith\"/>\n\nThe [[mixolydian mode]] is consonant with the first 10 harmonics of the harmonic series (the 11th harmonic, a tritone, is not in the mixolydian mode).  The [[ionian mode]] is consonant with only the first 6 harmonics of the series (the 7th harmonic, a minor seventh, is not in the ionian mode).\n\n== Timbre of musical instruments ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe relative [[amplitude]]s (strengths) of the various harmonics primarily determine the [[timbre]] of different instruments and sounds, though onset [[transient (acoustics)|transients]], [[formant]]s, [[noise]]s, and inharmonicities also play a role. For example, the [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]] have similar [[mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]]s and [[reed (music)|reeds]], and both produce sound through [[resonance]] of air inside a chamber whose mouthpiece end is considered closed. Because the clarinet's resonator is cylindrical, the even-numbered harmonics are less present. The saxophone's resonator is conical, which allows the even-numbered harmonics to sound more strongly and thus produces a more complex tone. The [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] ringing of the instrument's metal resonator is even more prominent in the sounds of brass instruments.\n\nHuman ears tend to group phase-coherent, harmonically-related frequency components into a single sensation. Rather than perceiving the individual partials\u2013harmonic and inharmonic, of a musical tone, humans perceive them together as a tone color or timbre, and the overall [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is heard as the fundamental of the harmonic series being experienced. If a sound is heard that is made up of even just a few simultaneous sine tones, and if the intervals among those tones form part of a harmonic series, the brain tends to group this input into a sensation of the pitch of the fundamental of that series, [[Missing fundamental|even if the fundamental is not present]].\n\nVariations in the frequency of harmonics can also affect the ''perceived'' fundamental pitch. These variations, most clearly documented in the piano and other stringed instruments but also apparent in [[brass instrument]]s, are caused by a combination of metal stiffness and the interaction of the vibrating air or string with the resonating body of the instrument.\n\n==Interval strength==\n\n[[David Cope]] (1997) suggests the concept of [[Interval (music)#Consonant and dissonant|interval strength]],<ref name=\"Cope\">[[David Cope|Cope, David]] (1997). ''Techniques of the Contemporary Composer'', p. 40\u201341. New York, New York: Schirmer Books. {{ISBN|0-02-864737-8}}.</ref> in which an interval's strength, consonance, or stability (see [[consonance and dissonance]]) is determined by its approximation to a lower and stronger, or higher and weaker, position in the harmonic series. See also: [[Lipps\u2013Meyer law]].\n\nThus, an equal-tempered perfect fifth ({{Audio|perfect fifth on C.mid|play}}) is stronger than an equal-tempered [[minor third]] ({{Audio|minor third on C.mid|play}}), since they approximate a just perfect fifth ({{Audio|just perfect fifth on C.mid|play}}) and just minor third ({{Audio|just minor third on C.mid|play}}), respectively. The just minor third appears between harmonics 5 and 6 while the just fifth appears lower, between harmonics 2 and 3.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fourier series]]\n*[[Klang (music)]]\n*[[Otonality and Utonality]]\n*[[Piano acoustics]]\n*[[Scale of harmonics]]\n*[[Subharmonic]]\n*[[Undertone series]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web|last=Coul|first=Manuel Op de|title=List of intervals (Compiled)\n|url=http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/intervals.html|accessdate=2016-06-15|year=|publisher=Huygens-Fokker Foundation centre for microtonal music|quote=}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Datta A.

At the frequencies of each vibrating mode, waves travel in both directions along the string or air column, reinforcing and canceling each other to form [[standing wave]]s. Interaction with the surrounding air causes audible [[sound waves]], which travel away from the instrument. Because of the typical spacing of the [[resonance]]s, these frequencies are mostly limited to integer multiples, or [[harmonic]]s, of the lowest frequency, and such multiples form the harmonic series (see [[harmonic series (mathematics)]]).\n\nThe musical [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a note is usually perceived as the lowest [[#Partial|partial]] present (the fundamental frequency), which may be the one created by [[vibration]] over the full length of the string or air column, or a higher harmonic chosen by the player. The musical [[timbre]] of a steady tone from such an instrument is strongly affected by the relative strength of each harmonic.\n\n== Terminology {{anchor|Partial}} ==\n\n===Partial, harmonic, fundamental, inharmonicity, and overtone===\n\nA \"complex tone\" (the sound of a note with a timbre particular to the instrument playing the note) \"can be described as a combination of many simple periodic waves (i.e., [[sine wave]]s) or ''partials,'' each with its own frequency of vibration, amplitude, and [[Phase (waves)|phase]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Music, Thought, and Feeling: Understanding the Psychology of Music|author=[[William Forde Thompson]]|isbn=978-0-19-537707-1|page=46|year=2008|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/CognitivePsychology/?view=usa&ci=9780195377071}}</ref> (See also, [[Fourier analysis]].)\n\nA '''''partial''''' is any of the sine waves (or \"simple tones\", as Ellis calls them when translating Helmholtz) of which a complex tone is composed, not necessarily with an integer multiple of the lowest harmonic.\n\nA '''''harmonic''''' is any member of the harmonic series, an ideal set of frequencies that are positive integer multiples of a common [[fundamental frequency]]. The '''''fundamental''''' is obviously a harmonic because it is 1 times itself. A '''''harmonic partial''''' is any real partial component of a complex tone that matches (or nearly matches) an ideal harmonic.<ref>{{cite book | title = Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound | author = [[John R.

''[[Inharmonicity]]'' is a measure of the deviation of a partial from the closest ideal harmonic, typically measured in [[cent (music)|cents]] for each partial.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Historical Harpsichord Volume Two: The Metallurgy of 17th- and 18th- Century Music Wire | author = [[Martha Goodway]] and Jay Scott Odell | publisher = Pendragon Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-918728-54-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sE1mk8ed1dkC&pg=PA93&dq=inharmonicity+defined+partial+frequencies}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Definite pitch|pitched]] acoustic instruments are designed to have partials that are close to being whole-number ratios with very low inharmonicity; therefore, in music theory, and in instrument design, it is convenient, although not strictly accurate, to speak of the partials in those instruments' sounds as \"harmonics\", even though they may have some degree of inharmonicity. The [[piano]], one of the most important instruments of western tradition, contains a certain degree of inharmonicity among the frequencies generated by each string. Other pitched instruments, especially certain [[percussion]] instruments, such as [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]], [[tubular bell]]s, [[timpani]], and [[singing bowl]]s contain mostly inharmonic partials, yet may give the ear a good sense of pitch because of a few strong partials that resemble harmonics. Unpitched, or indefinite-pitched instruments, such as cymbals and tam-tams make sounds (produce spectra) that are rich in inharmonic partials and may give no impression of implying any particular pitch.\n\nAn '''''[[overtone]]''''' is any partial above the lowest partial. The term overtone does not imply harmonicity or inharmonicity and has no other special meaning other than to exclude the fundamental. It is mostly the relative strength of the different overtones that give an instrument its particular timbre, tone color, or character. When writing or speaking of overtones and partials numerically, care must be taken to designate each correctly to avoid any confusion of one for the other, so the second overtone may not be the third partial, because it is the second sound in a series.<ref>{{harvnb|Riemann|1896|p=143}}: \"let it be understood, the second overtone is not the third tone of the series, but the second\"</ref>\n \nSome electronic instruments, such as [[synthesizer]]s, can play a pure frequency with no overtones (a sine wave). Synthesizers can also combine pure frequencies into more complex tones, such as to simulate other instruments. Certain flutes and ocarinas are very nearly without overtones.\n\n==Frequencies, wavelengths, and musical intervals in example systems==\n[[File:Harmonic series to 32.png|250px|thumb|Even-numbered string harmonics from 2nd up to the 64th (5&nbsp;octaves).]]\nOne of the simplest cases to visualise is a vibrating string, as in the illustration; the string has fixed points at each end, and each harmonic [[normal mode|mode]] divides it into 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., equal-sized sections resonating at increasingly higher frequencies.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Physics and Psychophysics of Music |first=Juan G. |last=Roederer |isbn=0-387-94366-8 |page=106 |year=1995 }}</ref> Similar arguments apply to vibrating air columns in wind instruments (for example, \"the French horn was originally a valveless instrument that could play only the notes of the harmonic series\"<ref>{{cite book |author1=Kostka, Stefan |author2=Payne, Dorothy |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Tonal Harmony |page=102 |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |ISBN=0-07-035874-5}}</ref>), although these are complicated by having the possibility of anti-nodes (that is, the air column is closed at one end and open at the other), [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] as opposed to [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]]s, or end-openings that run the gamut from no flare, cone flare, or exponentially shaped flares (such as in various bells).\n\nIn most pitched musical instruments, the fundamental (first harmonic) is accompanied by other, higher-frequency harmonics. Thus shorter-wavelength, higher-frequency [[wave]]s occur with varying prominence and give each instrument its characteristic tone quality. The fact that a string is fixed at each end means that the longest allowed wavelength on the string (which gives the fundamental frequency) is twice the length of the string (one round trip, with a half cycle fitting between the nodes at the two ends). Other allowed  wavelengths are {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|5}}, {{frac|1|6}}, etc. times that of the fundamental.\n\nTheoretically, these shorter wavelengths correspond to [[vibrations]] at frequencies that are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., times the fundamental frequency. Physical characteristics of the vibrating medium and/or the resonator it vibrates against often alter these frequencies. (See [[inharmonicity]] and [[stretched tuning]] for alterations specific to wire-stringed instruments and certain electric pianos.) However, those alterations are small, and except for precise, highly specialized tuning, it is reasonable to think of the frequencies of the harmonic series as integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nThe harmonic series is an [[arithmetic series]] (1\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 2\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 3\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 4\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 5\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, ...). In terms of frequency (measured in cycles per second, or [[hertz]] (Hz) where {{mvar|f}} is the fundamental frequency), the difference between consecutive harmonics is therefore constant and equal to the fundamental. But because human ears respond to sound nonlinearly, higher harmonics are perceived as \"closer together\" than lower ones. On the other hand, the [[octave]] series is a [[geometric progression]] (2\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 4\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 8\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, 16\u00d7{{mvar|f}}, ...), and people perceive these distances as \"the same\" in the sense of musical interval. In terms of what one hears, each octave in the harmonic series is divided into increasingly \"smaller\" and more numerous intervals.\n\nThe second harmonic, whose frequency is twice of the fundamental, sounds an octave higher; the third harmonic, three times the frequency of the fundamental, sounds a [[perfect fifth]] above the second harmonic. The fourth harmonic vibrates at four times the frequency of the fundamental and sounds a [[perfect fourth]] above the third harmonic (two octaves above the fundamental). Double the harmonic number means double the frequency (which sounds an octave higher).\n\n<!--image shown wider than 400px to display detail-->\n[[Image:Harmonic Series.png|thumb|center|650px|An illustration in musical notation of the harmonic series (on C) up to the 20th&nbsp;harmonic.

This objective structure is augmented by psychoacoustic phenomena. For example, a perfect fifth, say 200 and 300&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second), causes a listener to perceive a [[combination tone]] of 100&nbsp;Hz (the difference between 300&nbsp;Hz and 200&nbsp;Hz); that is, an octave below the lower (actual sounding) note. This 100&nbsp;Hz first-order combination tone then interacts with both notes of the interval to produce second-order combination tones of 200 (300&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;100) and 100 (200&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;100) Hz and all further nth-order combination tones are all the same, being formed from various subtraction of 100, 200, and 300. When one contrasts this with a dissonant interval such as a [[tritone]](not tempered) with a frequency ratio of 7:5 one gets, for example, 700&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;500&nbsp;=&nbsp;200 (1st order combination tone) and 500&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;200&nbsp;=&nbsp;300 (2nd order). The rest of the combination tones are octaves of 100&nbsp;Hz so the 7:5 interval actually contains 4&nbsp;notes: 100&nbsp;Hz (and its octaves), 300&nbsp;Hz, 500&nbsp;Hz and 700&nbsp;Hz. Note that the lowest combination tone (100&nbsp;Hz) is a 17th (2&nbsp;octaves and a [[major third]]) below the lower (actual sounding) note of the [[tritone]]. All the intervals succumb to similar analysis as has been demonstrated by [[Paul Hindemith]] in his book ''The Craft of Musical Composition'', although he rejected the use of harmonics from the 7th and beyond.<ref name=\"Hindemith\"/>\n\nThe [[mixolydian mode]] is consonant with the first 10 harmonics of the harmonic series (the 11th harmonic, a tritone, is not in the mixolydian mode).  The [[ionian mode]] is consonant with only the first 6 harmonics of the series (the 7th harmonic, a minor seventh, is not in the ionian mode).\n\n== Timbre of musical instruments ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe relative [[amplitude]]s (strengths) of the various harmonics primarily determine the [[timbre]] of different instruments and sounds, though onset [[transient (acoustics)|transients]], [[formant]]s, [[noise]]s, and inharmonicities also play a role. For example, the [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]] have similar [[mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]]s and [[reed (music)|reeds]], and both produce sound through [[resonance]] of air inside a chamber whose mouthpiece end is considered closed. Because the clarinet's resonator is cylindrical, the even-numbered harmonics are less present. The saxophone's resonator is conical, which allows the even-numbered harmonics to sound more strongly and thus produces a more complex tone. The [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] ringing of the instrument's metal resonator is even more prominent in the sounds of brass instruments.\n\nHuman ears tend to group phase-coherent, harmonically-related frequency components into a single sensation. Rather than perceiving the individual partials\u2013harmonic and inharmonic, of a musical tone, humans perceive them together as a tone color or timbre, and the overall [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is heard as the fundamental of the harmonic series being experienced. If a sound is heard that is made up of even just a few simultaneous sine tones, and if the intervals among those tones form part of a harmonic series, the brain tends to group this input into a sensation of the pitch of the fundamental of that series, [[Missing fundamental|even if the fundamental is not present]].\n\nVariations in the frequency of harmonics can also affect the ''perceived'' fundamental pitch. These variations, most clearly documented in the piano and other stringed instruments but also apparent in [[brass instrument]]s, are caused by a combination of metal stiffness and the interaction of the vibrating air or string with the resonating body of the instrument.\n\n==Interval strength==\n\n[[David Cope]] (1997) suggests the concept of [[Interval (music)#Consonant and dissonant|interval strength]],<ref name=\"Cope\">[[David Cope|Cope, David]] (1997). ''Techniques of the Contemporary Composer'', p. 40\u201341. New York, New York: Schirmer Books. {{ISBN|0-02-864737-8}}.</ref> in which an interval's strength, consonance, or stability (see [[consonance and dissonance]]) is determined by its approximation to a lower and stronger, or higher and weaker, position in the harmonic series. See also: [[Lipps\u2013Meyer law]].\n\nThus, an equal-tempered perfect fifth ({{Audio|perfect fifth on C.mid|play}}) is stronger than an equal-tempered [[minor third]] ({{Audio|minor third on C.mid|play}}), since they approximate a just perfect fifth ({{Audio|just perfect fifth on C.mid|play}}) and just minor third ({{Audio|just minor third on C.mid|play}}), respectively.

After she is fired for giving advice to her clients rather than teaching them dance, she attempts to convince her [[common-law husband]] ([[Michael Madsen]]) to move to [[Chicago]] with her. After he declines and then belittles her, she decides to move there without him.\n\nOnce she arrives, she stands on a bridge enjoying the view of the city when she accidentally drops a twenty dollar bill. As she climbs over the rail to retrieve the money, Jack ([[James Woods]]), an investigative journalist, sees her from the office window of the newspaper for which he works, and assumes that she is trying to commit [[suicide]]. He runs out to rescue her, but as he attempts to grab her and \"save\" her, Shirlee loses her balance, and almost falls into the water below; she loses the money she had been trying to recover.\n\nAfter they recover, and she informs Jack that she had, in fact, not been attempting suicide, but was merely trying to recover a twenty dollar bill, Jack tries to give her money, saying she must need it more than him if she is willing to risk her life to retrieve it.\n\nShe refuses and the two part. Shirlee stops into a cafe for breakfast, and strikes up a conversation with another customer, Janice ([[Teri Hatcher]]), who is annoyed at having been stood up by her boyfriend the previous evening. Shirlee tells Janice that he is taking her for granted, and advises her to end the relationship, only to realize that Janice's boyfriend is, in fact, Jack; Jack shows up, and Janice tells him she no longer wants to see him. Jack thanks Shirlee for \"wrecking his entire day\", as he exits the cafe.\n\nAfter a series of failed job interviews, a manager at a local radio station ([[Paula Newsome]]) hires her as a switchboard operator, despite her lack of experience, and during her first day, she inadvertently walks into a studio, and is mistaken for the station's new call in therapist, is put on the air, and begins hesitantly talking with the show's callers. Upon completion of the show, the program director arrives, and fires Shirlee, along with the producer and engineer, who had made the mistake in putting her on the air.\n\nHowever, Shirlee's radio segment becomes in high demand with their audience, prompting the radio station boss, Mr. Perlman, to demand that Shirlee be the new radio personality. Alan finds Shirlee and convince her to do the show offering an $800 per week contract. Shirlee accepts the position, but there is one condition: she must pretend to be a real clinical doctor.\n\nShe reluctantly accepts and becomes a popular radio figure as \"Doctor Shirlee.\" Jack suspects something when he realizes the woman who was ready to risk her life for twenty dollars is a doctor. Although his editor disagrees, Jack pursues the story. He begins to date Shirlee, initially in an attempt to get closer to her to uncover her story, but he soon falls in love with her. Shirlee's boyfriend from Arkansas arrives in Chicago to try to get her back, though his attempts fall short, and Shirlee and Jack make love.\n\nAfterwards, Jack develops true feelings for her and refuses to publish the story, resigning from his job over the matter. However, Shirlee receives another visit from her ex, who tells her that he just remembered having previously met Jack in Arkansas, and that he was asking a number of questions about her. This leads Shirlee to realize that Jack is, in fact, a reporter, and his interest in her is merely a means to uncovering her story. She storms off, and refuses to take Jack's calls.\n\nAs Shirlee's popularity increases, a mishap involving some of her previous advice to one of her callers eventually causes her to confess the truth to everyone on air that she is not a real doctor, and she then leaves the show. All of her listeners call in and want her back, regardless of her credentials. Someone calls the show and tells everyone listening to honk their horns at midnight if they want Shirlee back. Jack tracks Shirlee down on the same bridge where they had first met and convinces her to take him back.\n\nWhen she hears the horns, Jack tells her that they are for her. She eventually goes back to the radio show, but insists that she just wants to be called \"Shirlee.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n! Actor !!

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving Pitmiddle of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving Pitmiddle of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone).

The Hausa city states emerged as southern terminals of the Trans-Saharan caravan trade.

Hausa merchants in each of these cities collected trade items from domestic areas such as leather, dyed cloth, horse gear, metal locks and Kola nuts from the rain forest region to the south through trade or slave raiding, processed (and taxed) them and then sent them north to cities along the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/hausa-city-states|title=Hausa City States (Nigeria) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=2009-08-24}}</ref> By the 12th century AD the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major trading powers, competing with [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]] and the [[Mali Empire]].<ref>Hogben/[[Anthony Kirk-Greene]], ''Emirates'', 82-88; Lange, ''Kingdoms'', 216-221, 554 n. 25.</ref> The primary exports were [[leather]], [[gold]], [[Textile|cloth]], [[salt]], [[kola nuts]], [[slaves]], animal hides, and [[henna]].

It is a 50-foot edifice located in the centre of the city of Katsina, the capital of [[Katsina State]]. The Gobarau minaret, a symbol of the state, is an early example of [[Islamic architecture]] in a city that prides itself as an important Islamic learning centre. The minaret is believed to be one of West Africa's first multi-storey buildings and was once the tallest building in Katsina. The mosque's origin is attributed to the efforts of the influential Islamic scholar Sheikh [[Muhammad al-Maghili]] and Sultan Muhammadu Korau of Katsina. Al-Maghili was from the town of [[Tlemcen]] in present-day Algeria and taught for a while in Katsina, which had become a centre of learning at this time, when he visited the town in the late 15th century during the reign of Muhammadu Korau. He and Korau discussed the idea of building a mosque to serve as a centre for spiritual and intellectual activities. The Gobarau mosque was designed and built to reflect the Timbuktu-style of architecture.

In fact a large number of Fulani living in Hausa regions cannot speak Fulfulde at all and speak Hausa as their first language.

These results are consistent with linguistic and archeological data, suggesting a possible common ancestry of Nilo-Saharan speaking populations from an eastern Sudanese homeland within the past ~10,500 years, with subsequent bi-directional migration westward to Lake Chad and southward into modern day southern Sudan, and more recent migration eastward into Kenya and Tanzania ~3,000 ya (giving rise to Southern Nilotic speakers) and westward into Chad ~2,500 ya (giving rise to Central Sudanic speakers) (S62, S65, S67, S74). A proposed migration of proto-Chadic Afroasiatic speakers ~7,000 ya from the central Sahara into the [[Lake Chad Basin]] may have caused many western Nilo-Saharans to shift to Chadic languages (S99). Our data suggest that this shift was not accompanied by large amounts of Afroasiatic16 gene flow.

Consequently, and in spite of strong competition from western European culture as adopted by their southern Nigerian counterparts, have maintained a rich and peculiar mode of dressing, food, language, marriage system, education system, traditional architecture, sports, music and other forms of traditional entertainment.\n<br />\n===Language===\n{{main|Hausa language}}\n[[File:Afro asiatic peoples nigeria.png|thumb|Ethnolinguistic territories of the Hausa people in [[Nigeria]] (in yellow)]]\n[[File:Hausa language niger.png|thumb|Ethnolinguistic territories of the Hausa people in [[Niger]] (in yellow)]]\nThe [[Hausa language]], a member of [[Afroasiatic]] family of languages, has more first-language speakers than any other [[Languages of Africa|African language]]. It has an estimated 67 million first-language speakers, and close to 50 million second-language speakers.<ref>Nationalencyklopedin \"V\u00e4rldens 100 st\u00f6rsta spr\u00e5k 2007\" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), ''[[SIL Ethnologue]]''</ref> The main Hausa-speaking area is northern Nigeria and Niger. Hausa is also widely spoken in northern [[Ghana]], Cameroon, Chad, [[Sudanese Hausa]] in Sudan and the Ivory Coast as well as among [[Fulani]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Gur people|Gur]], [[Shuwa Arab]], and other [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] speaking groups. There are also large Hausa communities in every major African city in neighbourhoods called ''zango''s or ''zongo''s, meaning \"caravan camp\" in Hausa (denoting the [[trade|trading post]] origins of these communities). Most Hausa speakers, regardless of ethnic affiliation, are [[Muslims]]; Hausa often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among Muslims in non-Hausa areas.\n\nThere is a large and growing printed literature in Hausa, which includes novels, poetry, plays, instruction in Islamic practice, books on development issues, newspapers, news magazines, and technical academic works. Radio and television broadcasting in Hausa is ubiquitous in northern Nigeria and Niger, and radio stations in Cameroon have regular Hausa broadcasts, as do international broadcasters such as the BBC, VOA, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, Radio Beijing, RFI France, IRIB Iran, and others.\n\nHausa is used as the language of instruction at the elementary level in schools in northern Nigeria, and Hausa is available as course of study in northern Nigerian universities. In addition, several advanced degrees (Masters and PhD) are offered in Hausa in various universities in the UK, US, and Germany. Hausa is also being used in various social media networks around the world.\n\nHausa is considered one of the world's major languages, and it has widespread use in a number of countries of Africa. Hausa's rich poetry, prose, and musical literature, is increasingly available in print and in audio and video recordings. The study of Hausa provides an informative entry into the culture of [[Islam]]ic Africa. Throughout Africa, there is a strong connection between Hausa and Islam. \n\nThe influence of the Hausa language on the languages of many non-Hausa Muslim peoples in African is readily apparent. Likewise, many Hausa cultural practices, including such overt features as dress and food, are shared by other Muslim communities. Because of the dominant position which the Hausa language and culture have long held, the study of Hausa provides crucial background for other areas such as African history, politics (particularly in Nigeria and Niger), gender studies, commerce, and the arts.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Gobarau Minaret Katsina.JPG|thumb|150px|The 15th-century Gobarau [[minaret]] in [[Katsina]]]]\n\nOrthodox [[Sunni]] Islam (Sufi Islam) is the predominant and historically established religion of the Hausa people. Islam has been present in [[Hausaland]] as early as the 11th century - giving rise to famous native Sufi saints and scholars such as Wali Muhammad dan Masani (d.1667) and Wali Muhammad dan Marna((d. 1655) in Katsina - mostly among long-distance traders to North Africa whom in turn had spread it to common people while the ruling class had remain largely pagan or mixed their practice of Islam with pagan practices. By the 14th Century Hausa traders were already spreading Islam across large swathe of west Africa such as Ghana, Cote d Ivoire etc.. \n\n[[Muslim scholars]] of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practiced in royal courts. A desire for reform contributed to the formation of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].<ref>Robinson, David, ''Muslim Societies in African History'' (Cambridge, 2004), p141</ref> The formation of this state strengthened Islam in rural areas. The Hausa people have been an important factor for the spread of Islam in West Africa. Today, the current [[Sultan of Sokoto]] is regarded as the traditional religious leader (''Sarkin Musulmi'') of Sunni Hausa-Fulani in Nigeria and beyond.\n\n[[Maguzawa|Maguzanci]], an [[African Traditional Religion]], was practised extensively before Islam. In the more remote areas of Hausaland, the people continue to practise Maguzanci. Closer to urban areas, it is not as common, but with elements still held among the beliefs of urban dwellers. Practices include the sacrifice of animals for personal ends, but it is not legitimate to practise Maguzanci magic for harm. People of urbanized areas tend to retain a \"cult of [[spirit possession]],\" known as [[Bori (religion)|Bori]]. It incorporates the old religion's elements of [[African Traditional Religion]] and [[Magic and religion|magic]].<ref>Adeline Masquelier.

The gowns have wide openings on both sides for ventilation. The trousers are loose at the top and center, but rather tight around the legs. Leather sandals and turbans are also typical.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is a large flowing gown known as ''Babban riga'' also known by various other names due to adaptation by many ethnic groups neighboring the Hausa (see [[indigo]] [[Boubou (clothing)|Babban Riga/Gandora]]). These large flowing gowns usually feature elaborate embroidery designs around the neck and chest area.\n\nMen also wear colourful embroidered caps known as ''hula.'' Depending on their location and occupation, they may wear the turban around this to veil the face. The women can be identified by [[wrapper (clothing)|wrappers]] called ''zani,'' made with colourful cloth known as ''atampa or Ankara'', (a descendant of early designs from the famous [[Tie-dye]] techniques the Hausa have for centuries been known for) accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie (kallabi) and shawl (Gyale).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n[[File:Hausa architecture.jpg|thumb|alt=|Hausa home]]\n\n{{main article|Hausa Architecture}}The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age. Many of their early [[mosques]] and palaces are bright and colourful, including intricate engraving or elaborate symbols designed into the facade<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ateliermasomi.com/blog/187|title=Building Facades in Hausa Architecture}}</ref> This architectural style is known as ''[[Tubali]]'' which means ''architecture'' in the Hausa language. The ancient Kano city walls were built in order to provide security to the growing population. The foundation for the construction of the wall was laid by Sarki Gijimasu from 1095 - 1134 and was completed in the middle of the 14th century. In the 16th century, the walls were further extended to their present position. The gates are as old as the walls and were used to control movement of people in and out of the city.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> \n\nHausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of [[parapets]] related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colours to convey information about the occupant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ateliermasomi.com/blog/187|title=Building Facades in Hausa Architecture}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\nThe Hausa culture is rich in traditional sporting events such as boxing ([[Dambe]]), stick fight (Takkai), wrestling (Kokawa) etc. that were originally organized to celebrate harvests but over the generations developed into sporting events for entertainment purposes.\n\n#'''[[Dambe]]'''\nDambe is a brutal form of traditional martial art associated with the Hausa people of West Africa. Its origin is shrouded in mystery. However, Edward Powe, a researcher of Nigerian martial art culture recognizes striking similarities in stance and single wrapped fist \u00a0of Hausa boxers to images of ancient Egyptian boxers from the 12th and 13th dynasties.\n\nIt originally started out among the lower class of Hausa Butcher caste groups and later developed into a way of practicing military skills and then \u00a0into sporting events through generations of Northern Nigerians. It is fought in rounds of three or less which have no time limits. A round ends if an opponent is knocked out, a fighter's knee, body or hand touch the ground, inactivity or halted by an official.\n\nDambe's primary weapon is the \u201cspear\u201d, a single dominant hand wrapped from fist to forearm in thick strips of cotton bandage that is held in place by knotted cord dipped in salt and allowed to dry for maximum body damage on opponents, while the other arm, held open, serve as the \u201cshield\" to protect fighters head from opponent's blows or used to grab an opponent. Fighters usually end up with split brows, broken jaws and noses or even sustain brain damage.Dambe fighters may receive money, cattle, farm produce or jewelry as winnings but generally it was fought for fame from representations of towns and fighting clans.\n\n=== Food ===\n[[File:\"Kilishi\".JPG|right|thumb|[[Kilishi]], a Hausa delicacy similar to [[jerky]]]]\nThe most common food that the Hausa people prepare consists of [[Cereal|grains]], such as [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[rice]], or [[maize]], which are ground into flour for a variety of different kinds of dishes. This food is popularly known as ''tuwo'' in the Hausa language.\n\nUsually, breakfast consists of [[cakes]] made from ground beans and fried, known as ''kosai''; or made from wheat flour soaked for a day, fried and served with sugar, known as ''funkaso''. Both of these cakes can be served with [[porridge]] and [[sugar]] known as ''kunu'' or ''koko''. Lunch or dinner usually feature a heavy porridge with soup and stew known as ''tuwo da miya''. The soup and stew are usually prepared with ground or chopped [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, and local spices.\n\nSpices and other vegetables, such as [[spinach]], [[pumpkin]], or [[okra]], are added to the soup during preparation. The stew is prepared with meat, which can include goat or cow meat, but not pork, due to Islamic food restrictions. [[Beans]], [[peanut]]s, and [[milk]] are also served as a complementary [[protein]] diet for the Hausa people.\n\nThe most famous of all Hausa food is most likely [[Suya]], a spicy [[shish kebab]] like skewered meat which is a popular food item in various parts of Nigeria and is enjoyed as a delicacy in much of [[West Africa]] and balangu or gasshi.\n\nA dried version of Suya is called [[Kilishi]].<ref name=\"Raw Story-2012\">{{cite news|last=Agence France-Presse|title=Nigerian roadside barbecue shacks thrive in the midst of Islamist insurgency|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/05/22/nigerian-roadside-barbecue-shacks-thrive-in-the-midst-of-islamist-insurgency/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:\u0645\u0635\u062d\u0641 \u0646\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0637\u0628\u0648\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u062e\u0637 \u0647\u0627\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a.jpg|thumb|A lithographic print from Nigeria in the early 20th century featuring text from the Surah of [[Hud (surah)|Hud]], printed in the [[Hausawi script|''Hausawi'' script]].]]\n[[File:Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07.png|thumb|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony]]\nA modern literary movement led by female Hausa writers has grown since the late 1980s when writer [[Balaraba Ramat Yakubu]] came to popularity. In time, the writers spurred a unique genre known as Kano market literature \u2014 so named because the books are often self-published and sold in the markets of Nigeria.

Hausa merchants in each of these cities collected trade items from domestic areas such as leather, dyed cloth, horse gear, metal locks and Kola nuts from the rain forest region to the south through trade or slave raiding, processed (and taxed) them and then sent them north to cities along the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/hausa-city-states|title=Hausa City States (Nigeria) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=2009-08-24}}</ref> By the 12th century AD the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major trading powers, competing with [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]] and the [[Mali Empire]].<ref>Hogben/[[Anthony Kirk-Greene]], ''Emirates'', 82-88; Lange, ''Kingdoms'', 216-221, 554 n. 25.</ref> The primary exports were [[leather]], [[gold]], [[Textile|cloth]], [[salt]], [[kola nuts]], [[slaves]], animal hides, and [[henna]].

It is a 50-foot edifice located in the centre of the city of Katsina, the capital of [[Katsina State]]. The Gobarau minaret, a symbol of the state, is an early example of [[Islamic architecture]] in a city that prides itself as an important Islamic learning centre. The minaret is believed to be one of West Africa's first multi-storey buildings and was once the tallest building in Katsina. The mosque's origin is attributed to the efforts of the influential Islamic scholar Sheikh [[Muhammad al-Maghili]] and Sultan Muhammadu Korau of Katsina. Al-Maghili was from the town of [[Tlemcen]] in present-day Algeria and taught for a while in Katsina, which had become a centre of learning at this time, when he visited the town in the late 15th century during the reign of Muhammadu Korau. He and Korau discussed the idea of building a mosque to serve as a centre for spiritual and intellectual activities. The Gobarau mosque was designed and built to reflect the Timbuktu-style of architecture. It became an important centre for learning, attracting scholars and students from far and wide, and later served as a kind of university.\n<ref>zodml.org/discover-nigeria/heritage-and-culture/gobarau-minaret#.VTGE1yHBzGc</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad Rumfa]] was the Sultan of the [[Sultanate of Kano]], located in modern-day [[Kano State]], [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Nigeria]].

In fact a large number of Fulani living in Hausa regions cannot speak Fulfulde at all and speak Hausa as their first language.

These results are consistent with linguistic and archeological data, suggesting a possible common ancestry of Nilo-Saharan speaking populations from an eastern Sudanese homeland within the past ~10,500 years, with subsequent bi-directional migration westward to Lake Chad and southward into modern day southern Sudan, and more recent migration eastward into Kenya and Tanzania ~3,000 ya (giving rise to Southern Nilotic speakers) and westward into Chad ~2,500 ya (giving rise to Central Sudanic speakers) (S62, S65, S67, S74). A proposed migration of proto-Chadic Afroasiatic speakers ~7,000 ya from the central Sahara into the [[Lake Chad Basin]] may have caused many western Nilo-Saharans to shift to Chadic languages (S99). Our data suggest that this shift was not accompanied by large amounts of Afroasiatic16 gene flow.

It has an estimated 67 million first-language speakers, and close to 50 million second-language speakers.<ref>Nationalencyklopedin \"V\u00e4rldens 100 st\u00f6rsta spr\u00e5k 2007\" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), ''[[SIL Ethnologue]]''</ref> The main Hausa-speaking area is northern Nigeria and Niger. Hausa is also widely spoken in northern [[Ghana]], Cameroon, Chad, [[Sudanese Hausa]] in Sudan and the Ivory Coast as well as among [[Fulani]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Gur people|Gur]], [[Shuwa Arab]], and other [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] speaking groups. There are also large Hausa communities in every major African city in neighbourhoods called ''zango''s or ''zongo''s, meaning \"caravan camp\" in Hausa (denoting the [[trade|trading post]] origins of these communities). Most Hausa speakers, regardless of ethnic affiliation, are [[Muslims]]; Hausa often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among Muslims in non-Hausa areas.\n\nThere is a large and growing printed literature in Hausa, which includes novels, poetry, plays, instruction in Islamic practice, books on development issues, newspapers, news magazines, and technical academic works. Radio and television broadcasting in Hausa is ubiquitous in northern Nigeria and Niger, and radio stations in Cameroon have regular Hausa broadcasts, as do international broadcasters such as the BBC, VOA, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, Radio Beijing, RFI France, IRIB Iran, and others.\n\nHausa is used as the language of instruction at the elementary level in schools in northern Nigeria, and Hausa is available as course of study in northern Nigerian universities. In addition, several advanced degrees (Masters and PhD) are offered in Hausa in various universities in the UK, US, and Germany. Hausa is also being used in various social media networks around the world.\n\nHausa is considered one of the world's major languages, and it has widespread use in a number of countries of Africa. Hausa's rich poetry, prose, and musical literature, is increasingly available in print and in audio and video recordings. The study of Hausa provides an informative entry into the culture of [[Islam]]ic Africa. Throughout Africa, there is a strong connection between Hausa and Islam. \n\nThe influence of the Hausa language on the languages of many non-Hausa Muslim peoples in African is readily apparent. Likewise, many Hausa cultural practices, including such overt features as dress and food, are shared by other Muslim communities. Because of the dominant position which the Hausa language and culture have long held, the study of Hausa provides crucial background for other areas such as African history, politics (particularly in Nigeria and Niger), gender studies, commerce, and the arts.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Gobarau Minaret Katsina.JPG|thumb|150px|The 15th-century Gobarau [[minaret]] in [[Katsina]]]]\n\nOrthodox [[Sunni]] Islam (Sufi Islam) is the predominant and historically established religion of the Hausa people.

By the 14th Century Hausa traders were already spreading Islam across large swathe of west Africa such as Ghana, Cote d Ivoire etc.. \n\n[[Muslim scholars]] of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practiced in royal courts. A desire for reform contributed to the formation of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].<ref>Robinson, David, ''Muslim Societies in African History'' (Cambridge, 2004), p141</ref> The formation of this state strengthened Islam in rural areas. The Hausa people have been an important factor for the spread of Islam in West Africa. Today, the current [[Sultan of Sokoto]] is regarded as the traditional religious leader (''Sarkin Musulmi'') of Sunni Hausa-Fulani in Nigeria and beyond.\n\n[[Maguzawa|Maguzanci]], an [[African Traditional Religion]], was practised extensively before Islam. In the more remote areas of Hausaland, the people continue to practise Maguzanci. Closer to urban areas, it is not as common, but with elements still held among the beliefs of urban dwellers. Practices include the sacrifice of animals for personal ends, but it is not legitimate to practise Maguzanci magic for harm. People of urbanized areas tend to retain a \"cult of [[spirit possession]],\" known as [[Bori (religion)|Bori]]. It incorporates the old religion's elements of [[African Traditional Religion]] and [[Magic and religion|magic]].<ref>Adeline Masquelier.

The gowns have wide openings on both sides for ventilation. The trousers are loose at the top and center, but rather tight around the legs. Leather sandals and turbans are also typical.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is a large flowing gown known as ''Babban riga'' also known by various other names due to adaptation by many ethnic groups neighboring the Hausa (see [[indigo]] [[Boubou (clothing)|Babban Riga/Gandora]]). These large flowing gowns usually feature elaborate embroidery designs around the neck and chest area.\n\nMen also wear colourful embroidered caps known as ''hula.'' Depending on their location and occupation, they may wear the turban around this to veil the face. The women can be identified by [[wrapper (clothing)|wrappers]] called ''zani,'' made with colourful cloth known as ''atampa or Ankara'', (a descendant of early designs from the famous [[Tie-dye]] techniques the Hausa have for centuries been known for) accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie (kallabi) and shawl (Gyale).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n[[File:Hausa architecture.jpg|thumb|alt=|Hausa home]]\n\n{{main article|Hausa Architecture}}The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age.

The foundation for the construction of the wall was laid by Sarki Gijimasu from 1095 - 1134 and was completed in the middle of the 14th century. In the 16th century, the walls were further extended to their present position. The gates are as old as the walls and were used to control movement of people in and out of the city.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> \n\nHausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of [[parapets]] related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts.

Its origin is shrouded in mystery. However, Edward Powe, a researcher of Nigerian martial art culture recognizes striking similarities in stance and single wrapped fist \u00a0of Hausa boxers to images of ancient Egyptian boxers from the 12th and 13th dynasties.\n\nIt originally started out among the lower class of Hausa Butcher caste groups and later developed into a way of practicing military skills and then \u00a0into sporting events through generations of Northern Nigerians. It is fought in rounds of three or less which have no time limits. A round ends if an opponent is knocked out, a fighter's knee, body or hand touch the ground, inactivity or halted by an official.\n\nDambe's primary weapon is the \u201cspear\u201d, a single dominant hand wrapped from fist to forearm in thick strips of cotton bandage that is held in place by knotted cord dipped in salt and allowed to dry for maximum body damage on opponents, while the other arm, held open, serve as the \u201cshield\" to protect fighters head from opponent's blows or used to grab an opponent. Fighters usually end up with split brows, broken jaws and noses or even sustain brain damage.Dambe fighters may receive money, cattle, farm produce or jewelry as winnings but generally it was fought for fame from representations of towns and fighting clans.\n\n=== Food ===\n[[File:\"Kilishi\".JPG|right|thumb|[[Kilishi]], a Hausa delicacy similar to [[jerky]]]]\nThe most common food that the Hausa people prepare consists of [[Cereal|grains]], such as [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[rice]], or [[maize]], which are ground into flour for a variety of different kinds of dishes. This food is popularly known as ''tuwo'' in the Hausa language.\n\nUsually, breakfast consists of [[cakes]] made from ground beans and fried, known as ''kosai''; or made from wheat flour soaked for a day, fried and served with sugar, known as ''funkaso''. Both of these cakes can be served with [[porridge]] and [[sugar]] known as ''kunu'' or ''koko''. Lunch or dinner usually feature a heavy porridge with soup and stew known as ''tuwo da miya''. The soup and stew are usually prepared with ground or chopped [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, and local spices.\n\nSpices and other vegetables, such as [[spinach]], [[pumpkin]], or [[okra]], are added to the soup during preparation. The stew is prepared with meat, which can include goat or cow meat, but not pork, due to Islamic food restrictions. [[Beans]], [[peanut]]s, and [[milk]] are also served as a complementary [[protein]] diet for the Hausa people.\n\nThe most famous of all Hausa food is most likely [[Suya]], a spicy [[shish kebab]] like skewered meat which is a popular food item in various parts of Nigeria and is enjoyed as a delicacy in much of [[West Africa]] and balangu or gasshi.\n\nA dried version of Suya is called [[Kilishi]].<ref name=\"Raw Story-2012\">{{cite news|last=Agence France-Presse|title=Nigerian roadside barbecue shacks thrive in the midst of Islamist insurgency|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/05/22/nigerian-roadside-barbecue-shacks-thrive-in-the-midst-of-islamist-insurgency/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:\u0645\u0635\u062d\u0641 \u0646\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0637\u0628\u0648\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u062e\u0637 \u0647\u0627\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a.jpg|thumb|A lithographic print from Nigeria in the early 20th century featuring text from the Surah of [[Hud (surah)|Hud]], printed in the [[Hausawi script|''Hausawi'' script]].]]\n[[File:Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07.png|thumb|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony]]\nA modern literary movement led by female Hausa writers has grown since the late 1980s when writer [[Balaraba Ramat Yakubu]] came to popularity. In time, the writers spurred a unique genre known as Kano market literature \u2014 so named because the books are often self-published and sold in the markets of Nigeria. [[Islamic extremism]] and [[misogyny]] have hindered women's ability to work and write openly. However, the subversive nature of these novels, which are often romantic and family dramas that are otherwise hard to find in the Hausa language, have made them popular, especially among female readers. The genre is also referred to as ''littattafan soyayya'', or \"love literature.\"<ref>Laura Mallonee, [https://www.wired.com/2016/02/glenna-gordon-diagram-heart/ The Subversive Women Who Self-Publish Novels Amid Jihadist War], Wired, 17 February 2016.</ref>\n\n===Hausa symbolism===\nThe Hausa [[ethnic flag]] is a banner with five horizontal stripes\u2014from top to bottom they are red, yellow, indigo blue, green, and khaki beige.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ng%7Dhausa.html#nr|title=Hausa ethnic flag|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313025512/http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ng%7Dhausa.html|archivedate=13 March 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=25 April 2017|website=www.fotw.us}}</ref> The older and traditionally established motif of Hausa identity, the 'Dagin Arewa' [[eternal knot]] in a star shape, is used in historic architecture, design and embroidery.\n\n==Notable Hausa people==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please, only people with an article -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sir Ahmad Bello Sardaunan Sokoto]] \n* [[Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] \n* [[Alhaji Ado Bayero]] \n* [[Alhaji Tijjani Hashim]] \n* [[Alhaji Ahmad Chanchangi]] \n* [[Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau]]\n* [[Abdulkareem Baba Aminu]]\n* [[Abubakar Imam|Abubakar Imam Kagara]]\n* [[Ahmed Musa (footballer)|Ahmed Musa]]\n* [[Aisha Augie-Kuta]]\n* [[Abdul Samad Rabiu|Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu]]\n* [[Alhassan Dantata|Alhaji Alhassan Dantata]]\n* [[Aminu Dantata|Alhaji Aminu Dantata]]\n* [[Aliko Dangote|Alhaji Aliko Dangote]]\n* [[Sani Dangote|Alhaji Sani Dangote]]\n* [[Isa Kaita|Alhaji Isa Kaita]]\n* [[Isyaku Rabiu|Alhaji Isyaku Rabiu]]\n* [[Mamman Shata|Alhaji Mamman Shata Katsina]]\n* [[Umaru Mutallab|Alhaji Umaru Mutallab]]\n* [[Ali Nuhu]]\n* [[Amadou Moutari]]\n* [[Amina Sukhera]]\n* [[Attahiru Jega]]\n* [[Dan Maraya|Dan Maraya Jos]]\n* [[Daouda Malam Wank\u00e9]]\n* [[Haruna Babangida]]\n* [[Ibrahim Bar\u00e9 Ma\u00efnassara]]\n* [[Ibrahim Umar|Ibrahim H.

The title [[allusion|alludes]] to one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno's paradoxes of motion]], in which Achilles could never overtake the tortoise in a race. In Carroll's dialogue, the tortoise challenges Achilles to use the force of logic to make him accept the conclusion of a simple deductive argument. Ultimately, Achilles fails, because the clever tortoise leads him into an [[infinite regression]].\n\n==Summary of the dialogue==\nThe discussion begins by considering the following logical argument:\n* ''A'': \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\" ([[Euclidean relation]], a weakened form of the [[transitive property]])\n* ''B'': \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* Therefore, ''Z'': \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nThe Tortoise asks Achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and Achilles grants that it obviously does. The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether there might be a reader of [[Euclid]] who grants that the argument is ''logically valid'', as a ''sequence'', while denying that ''A'' and ''B'' are true. Achilles accepts that such a reader might exist, and that he would hold that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true, while not yet accepting that ''A'' and ''B'' are true (that is, a reader who denies the premises).\n\nThe Tortoise then asks Achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist, who accepts that ''A'' and ''B'' are true, but who does ''not'' yet accept the principle that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are both true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true. Achilles grants the Tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist. The Tortoise, then, asks Achilles to treat the Tortoise as a reader of this second kind. Achilles must now logically compel the Tortoise to accept that ''Z'' must be true. (The tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself; the [[syllogism]]'s conclusion, structure, or validity.)\n\nAfter writing down ''A'', ''B'', and ''Z'' in his notebook, Achilles asks the Tortoise to accept the hypothetical:\n* ''C'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n\nThe Tortoise agrees to accept ''C'', if Achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook, making the new argument:\n* ''A'': \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\"\n* ''B'': \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* ''C'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n* Therefore, ''Z'': \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nBut now that the Tortoise accepts premise ''C'', it still refuses to accept the expanded argument. When Achilles demands that \"If you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'', you must accept ''Z'',\" the Tortoise remarks that that's ''another'' hypothetical proposition, and suggests even if it accepts ''C'', it could still fail to conclude ''Z'' if it did not see the truth of:\n* ''D'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n\nThe Tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once Achilles writes it down, but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows, since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true, ''Z'' must be true:\n{{quote|\"And at last we've got to the end of this ideal racecourse! Now that you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', ''of course'' you accept ''Z''.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" said the Tortoise innocently. \"Let's make that quite clear. I accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D''. Suppose I ''still'' refused to accept ''Z''?\"\n\n\"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and ''force'' you to do it!\" Achilles triumphantly replied. \"Logic would tell you, 'You can't help yourself. Now that you've accepted ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', you must accept ''Z''!' So you've no choice, you see.\"\n\n\"Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth ''writing down'',\" said the Tortoise. \"So enter it in your notebook, please. We will call it\n{{block indent|(''E'') If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'' are true, ''Z'' must be true.}}\n\nUntil I've granted that, of course I needn't grant ''Z''. So it's quite a necessary step, you see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.}}\n\nThus, the list of premises continues to grow without end, leaving the argument always in the form:\n* (1): \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\"\n* (2): \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* (3): (1) and (2) \u21d2 (Z)\n* (4): (1) and (2) and (3) \u21d2 (Z)\n* ...\n* (''n''): (1) and (2) and (3) and (4) and ... and (''n'' \u2212 1) \u21d2 (''Z'')\n* Therefore, (''Z''): \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nAt each step, the Tortoise argues that even though he accepts all the premises that have been written down, there is some further premise (that if all of (1)&ndash;(''n'') are true, then (''Z'') must be true) that it still needs to accept before it is compelled to accept that (''Z'') is true.\n\n==Explanation==\nLewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from ''[[modus ponens]]'' deductions. \n:<math>\\frac{P \\to Q,\\; P}{\\therefore Q}</math>\nOr, in words: proposition ''P'' (is true) implies ''Q'' (is true), and given ''P'', therefore ''Q''.\n\nThe regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here modus ponens, and once ''that'' principle is explained, ''another'' principle is required to explain ''that'' principle. Thus, if the causal chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a [[rule of inference]] defined within the system, then it can be abided by simply by reasoning within the system. In analogy, chess is played according to a particular set of rules, and when a person plays chess, he cannot question or beg to differ from the given rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very framework of the game. That is not to say that the chess player agrees with these rules (consider for example, rule changes such as ''[[en passant]]''). Likewise, a formal system of logic consists of inference rules that are to be followed by the user of the system, and when a person reasons according to this formal system, he cannot question or differ from these inference rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very constituents of the system. That is not to say that the user reasoning according to this formal system agrees with these rules (consider for example, the constructivist's rejection of the [[Law of the Excluded Middle]] and the dialethist's rejection of the [[Law of noncontradiction]]). In this way, formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress: ''modus ponens'' is placed as a rule within the system, the validity of ''modus ponens'' is eschewed to without the system.\n\nIn propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows:\n\nP implies Q  if and only if the proposition ''not P or Q'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]].\n\nHence de modo ponente, [P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)] \u21d2 Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The Tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.\n\nIn addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.\n\nSome logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the [[material conditional|conditional connective]] and the [[Logical consequence|implication relation]]. These logicians use the phrase ''not p or q'' for the conditional connective and the term ''implies'' for an asserted implication relation.\n\n==Discussion==\nSeveral philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll's paradox. [[Bertrand Russell]] discussed the paradox briefly in [http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/s.38 \u00a7 38 of ''The Principles of Mathematics''] (1903), distinguishing between ''implication'' (associated with the form \"if ''p'', then ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''unasserted'' propositions, and ''inference'' (associated with the form \"''p'', therefore ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''asserted'' propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise's attempt to treat ''inferring'' ''Z'' from ''A'' and ''B'' as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the ''hypothetical'' \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, then ''Z'' is true.\"\n\nThe [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] philosopher [[Peter Winch]] discussed the paradox in ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that \"the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning ''to do'' something\" (p.&nbsp;57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper ''application'' of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of ''further'' rules, and so that \"a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts\" (p.&nbsp;53).\n\nCarroll's dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to [[conventionalism]] about logical truth,<ref name=\"Maddy\">{{cite journal | title=The Philosophy of Logic | author=[[Penelope Maddy|Maddy, P.]] | journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |date=December 2012  | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=481\u2013504 | doi=10.2178/bsl.1804010 | jstor=23316289}}</ref> later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O.

He further states that it is the inconceivability of (i.e. an observer\u2019s inability to consider) how inconsistency could exist within points of space that is the origin and basis for the truth of logic and the force which compels observers to accept logical truth. This inconceivability is thought to act as a counter-force to the force of an observer\u2019s continued consideration, containing them within a valid argument and forcing them to accept the truth of logical inference. A valid logical argument, according to Primus, is one whose propositions, either implicitly could or explicitly do, represent points of physical space, and which do not describe or require an inconsistency within said space for them to be true.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Primus|first=|date=2019|title=The inconceivability of inconsistency within space as the basis of logic].|url=https://www.purity.org/uploads/5/1/0/9/51097087/purism_-_the_inconceivability_of_inconsistency_within_space_as_the_basis_of_logic.pdf|journal=Dialogue|volume=62(1)|pages=1-24|issn=0012-2246|via=|}}</ref> \u00a0\n\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Deduction theorem}}\n*{{annotated link|Homunculus argument}}\n*{{annotated link|M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma}}\n*{{annotated link|Paradox}}\n*{{annotated link|Regress argument}}\n*{{annotated link|Rule of inference}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Lewis|title=What the Tortoise Said to Achilles|journal=Mind|date=1895|volume=104|issue=416|pages=691\u2013693|jstor=2254477|doi=10.1093/mind/104.416.691}}  Reprinted in ''The Penguin Complete Lewis Carroll'' (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1982), pp 1104\u20131108.\n* [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]].

So it's quite a necessary step, you see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.}}\n\nThus, the list of premises continues to grow without end, leaving the argument always in the form:\n* (1): \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\"\n* (2): \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* (3): (1) and (2) \u21d2 (Z)\n* (4): (1) and (2) and (3) \u21d2 (Z)\n* ...\n* (''n''): (1) and (2) and (3) and (4) and ... and (''n'' \u2212 1) \u21d2 (''Z'')\n* Therefore, (''Z''): \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nAt each step, the Tortoise argues that even though he accepts all the premises that have been written down, there is some further premise (that if all of (1)&ndash;(''n'') are true, then (''Z'') must be true) that it still needs to accept before it is compelled to accept that (''Z'') is true.\n\n==Explanation==\nLewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from ''[[modus ponens]]'' deductions. \n:<math>\\frac{P \\to Q,\\; P}{\\therefore Q}</math>\nOr, in words: proposition ''P'' (is true) implies ''Q'' (is true), and given ''P'', therefore ''Q''.\n\nThe regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here modus ponens, and once ''that'' principle is explained, ''another'' principle is required to explain ''that'' principle. Thus, if the causal chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a [[rule of inference]] defined within the system, then it can be abided by simply by reasoning within the system. In analogy, chess is played according to a particular set of rules, and when a person plays chess, he cannot question or beg to differ from the given rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very framework of the game. That is not to say that the chess player agrees with these rules (consider for example, rule changes such as ''[[en passant]]''). Likewise, a formal system of logic consists of inference rules that are to be followed by the user of the system, and when a person reasons according to this formal system, he cannot question or differ from these inference rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very constituents of the system. That is not to say that the user reasoning according to this formal system agrees with these rules (consider for example, the constructivist's rejection of the [[Law of the Excluded Middle]] and the dialethist's rejection of the [[Law of noncontradiction]]). In this way, formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress: ''modus ponens'' is placed as a rule within the system, the validity of ''modus ponens'' is eschewed to without the system.\n\nIn propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows:\n\nP implies Q  if and only if the proposition ''not P or Q'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]].\n\nHence de modo ponente, [P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)] \u21d2 Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The Tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.\n\nIn addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.\n\nSome logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the [[material conditional|conditional connective]] and the [[Logical consequence|implication relation]]. These logicians use the phrase ''not p or q'' for the conditional connective and the term ''implies'' for an asserted implication relation.\n\n==Discussion==\nSeveral philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll's paradox. [[Bertrand Russell]] discussed the paradox briefly in [http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/s.38 \u00a7 38 of ''The Principles of Mathematics''] (1903), distinguishing between ''implication'' (associated with the form \"if ''p'', then ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''unasserted'' propositions, and ''inference'' (associated with the form \"''p'', therefore ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''asserted'' propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise's attempt to treat ''inferring'' ''Z'' from ''A'' and ''B'' as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the ''hypothetical'' \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, then ''Z'' is true.\"\n\nThe [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] philosopher [[Peter Winch]] discussed the paradox in ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that \"the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning ''to do'' something\" (p.&nbsp;57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper ''application'' of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of ''further'' rules, and so that \"a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts\" (p.&nbsp;53).\n\nCarroll's dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to [[conventionalism]] about logical truth,<ref name=\"Maddy\">{{cite journal | title=The Philosophy of Logic | author=[[Penelope Maddy|Maddy, P.]] | journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |date=December 2012  | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=481\u2013504 | doi=10.2178/bsl.1804010 | jstor=23316289}}</ref> later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O.

He further states that it is the inconceivability of (i.e. an observer\u2019s inability to consider) how inconsistency could exist within points of space that is the origin and basis for the truth of logic and the force which compels observers to accept logical truth. This inconceivability is thought to act as a counter-force to the force of an observer\u2019s continued consideration, containing them within a valid argument and forcing them to accept the truth of logical inference. A valid logical argument, according to Primus, is one whose propositions, either implicitly could or explicitly do, represent points of physical space, and which do not describe or require an inconsistency within said space for them to be true.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Primus|first=|date=2019|title=The inconceivability of inconsistency within space as the basis of logic].|url=https://www.purity.org/uploads/5/1/0/9/51097087/purism_-_the_inconceivability_of_inconsistency_within_space_as_the_basis_of_logic.pdf|journal=Dialogue|volume=62(1)|pages=1-26|issn=0012-2246|}}</ref> \u00a0\n\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Deduction theorem}}\n*{{annotated link|Homunculus argument}}\n*{{annotated link|M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma}}\n*{{annotated link|Paradox}}\n*{{annotated link|Regress argument}}\n*{{annotated link|Rule of inference}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Lewis|title=What the Tortoise Said to Achilles|journal=Mind|date=1895|volume=104|issue=416|pages=691\u2013693|jstor=2254477|doi=10.1093/mind/104.416.691}}  Reprinted in ''The Penguin Complete Lewis Carroll'' (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1982), pp 1104\u20131108.\n* [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]].
