An effective nonproliferation regime whose members comply with their obligations provides an essential foundation for progress on disarmament and makes possible greater cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

NNWS parties to the NPT agree not to \"receive\", \"manufacture\", or \"acquire\" nuclear weapons or to \"seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons\" (Article II).

However, these undertakings have not been incorporated formally into the treaty, and the exact details have varied over time. The U.S. also had nuclear warheads targeted at North Korea, a non-NWS, from 1959 until 1991.

It was recognized that the [[Cold War]] deterrent relationship between just the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] was fragile. Having more nuclear-weapon states would reduce security for all, multiplying the risks of miscalculation, accidents, unauthorized use of weapons, escalation in tensions, and nuclear conflict. Moreover, since the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, it has been apparent that the development of nuclear capabilities by States could enable them to divert technology and materials for weapons purposes. Thus, the problem of preventing such diversions became a central issue in discussions on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nInitial efforts, which began in 1946, to create an international system enabling all States to have access to nuclear technology under appropriate safeguards, were terminated in 1949 without the achievement of this objective, due to serious political differences between the major Powers. By then, both the United States and the former Soviet Union had tested nuclear weapons, and were beginning to build their stockpiles.\n\nIn December 1953, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his \"[[Atoms for Peace]]\" proposal, presented to the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly, urged that an international organization be established to disseminate peaceful nuclear technology, while guarding against development of weapons capabilities in additional countries. His proposal resulted in 1957 in the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was charged with the dual responsibility for promotion and control of nuclear technology. IAEA technical activities began in 1958. An interim safeguards system for small nuclear reactors, put in place in 1961, was replaced in 1964 by a system covering larger installations and, over the following years, was expanded to include additional nuclear facilities. In recent years, efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the IAEA safeguards system culminated in the approval of the Model Additional Protocol by the IAEA Board of Governors in May 1997.\n\nWithin the framework of the United Nations, the principle of nuclear non-proliferation was addressed in negotiations as early as 1957. The NPT process was launched by [[Frank Aiken]], Irish Minister for External Affairs, in 1958. The NPT gained significant momentum in the early 1960s. The structure of a treaty to uphold nuclear non-proliferation as a norm of international behaviour had become clear by the mid-1960s, and by 1968 final agreement had been reached on a Treaty that would prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, enable cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament. It was opened for signature in 1968, with Finland the first [[List of parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|State to sign]]. Accession became nearly universal after the end of the [[Cold War]] and of South African [[apartheid]]. In 1992, The People's Republic of China and France acceded to the NPT, the last of the five nuclear powers recognized by the treaty to do so.\n\nThe treaty provided, in article X, for a conference to be convened 25 years after its entry into force to decide whether the treaty should continue in force indefinitely, or be extended for an additional fixed period or periods. Accordingly, at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in May 1995, state parties to the treaty agreed-without a vote-on the treaty's indefinite extension, and decided that review conferences should continue to be held every five years. After Brazil acceded to the NPT in 1998, the only remaining non-nuclear-weapon state which had not signed was Cuba, which joined the NPT (and the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] [[NWFZ]]) in 2002.\n\nSeveral NPT states parties have given up nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons programs. South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons program, but has since renounced it and acceded to the treaty in 1991 after destroying its small nuclear [[arsenal]]; after this, the remaining African countries signed the treaty. The [[former Soviet Republics]] where nuclear weapons had been based, namely Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, transferred those weapons to Russia and joined the NPT by 1994 following the signature of the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nSuccessor states from the breakups of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia also joined the treaty soon after their independence. Montenegro and East Timor were the last countries to accede to the treaty on their independence in 2006 and 2003; the only other country to accede in the 21st century was Cuba in 2002. The three Micronesian countries in [[Compact of Free Association]] with the USA joined the NPT in 1995, along with Vanuatu.\n\nMajor South American countries Argentina, Chile, and Brazil joined in 1995 and 1998. Arabian Peninsula countries included Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1988, Qatar and Kuwait in 1989, UAE in 1995, and Oman in 1997. The European states of [[Monaco]] and [[Andorra]] joined in 1995\u20136. Also acceding in the 1990s were Myanmar in 1992 and Guyana in 1993.\n\n===United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing===\n{{Main|Nuclear sharing}}\n[[File:nwfz.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|\n{{legend0|#0000FF|[[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]]s}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF0000|[[Nuclear weapons states]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF8800|[[Nuclear sharing]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#dddd00|Neither, but NPT}} ]]\n\nAt the time the treaty was being negotiated, [[NATO]] had in place secret [[Nuclear sharing|nuclear weapons sharing]] agreements whereby the United States provided nuclear weapons to be deployed by, and stored in, other NATO states.

A counter-argument is that the U.S. controlled the weapons in storage within the NATO states, and that no transfer of the weapons or control over them was intended \"unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the treaty would no longer be controlling\", so there is no breach of the NPT.<ref name=Donnelly>{{citation|url=http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm |title=The Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Articles I, II and VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons |author=Brian Donnelly, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] |publisher=Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean |accessdate=2009-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105200406/http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm |archivedate=5 January 2009 }}</ref> These agreements were disclosed to a few of the states, including the [[Soviet Union]], negotiating the treaty, but most of the states that signed the NPT in 1968 would not have known about these agreements and interpretations at that time.<ref name=\"is_it_legal\">Otfried Nassauer, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (ieer.org), Science for Democratic Action Volume 9 Number 3, May 2001, [http://www.ieer.org/sdafiles/vol_9/9-3/nato.html Nuclear Sharing in NATO: Is it Legal?]</ref>\n\nAs of 2005, it is estimated that the United States still provides about 180 tactical [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s for use by Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey under these NATO agreements.<ref name=\"nrdc eur\">Hans M.

This led to the development of a secret nuclear weapons program as an ultimate deterrent. South Africa has a large supply of uranium, which is mined in the country's gold mines. The government built a nuclear research facility at [[Pelindaba]] near Pretoria where uranium was enriched to fuel grade for the [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]] as well as weapon grade for bomb production.\n\nIn 1991, after international pressure and when a change of government was imminent, South African Ambassador to the United States [[Harry Schwarz]] signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1993, the then president [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] openly admitted that the country had developed a limited nuclear weapon capability. These weapons were subsequently dismantled before South Africa acceded to the NPT and opened itself up to IAEA inspection. In 1994, the IAEA completed its work and declared that the country had fully dismantled its nuclear weapons program.\n\n===Libya===\n{{See also|Libya and weapons of mass destruction}}\nLibya had signed (in 1968) and ratified (in 1975) the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and was subject to IAEA nuclear safeguards inspections, but undertook a secret nuclear weapons development program in violation of its NPT obligations, using material and technology provided by the [[A.Q.

Before the advent of the [[Syrian Civil War]] it was known to operate only one small Chinese-built research reactor, SRR-1. Despite being a proponent of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East the country was accused of pursuing a military nuclear program with a reported nuclear facility in a desert Syrian region of Deir ez-Zor. The reactor's components had likely been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor's striking similarity in shape and size to the North Korean Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. That information alarmed Israeli military and intelligence to such a degree that the idea of a targeted airstrike was conceived. It resulted in [[Operation Orchard]], that took place on 6 September 2007  and saw as many as eight Israeli aircraft taking part. The Israeli government is said to have bounced the idea of the operation off of the US Bush administration, although the latter declined to participate. The nuclear reactor was destroyed in the attack, which also killed about ten North Korean workers. The attack did not cause an international outcry or any serious Syrian retaliatory moves as both parties tried to keep it secret: Despite a half-century state of war declared by surrounding states Israel didn't want publicity as regards its breach of the ceasefire while Syria wasn't willing to acknowledge its clandestine nuclear program.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Leaving the treaty==\nArticle X allows a state to leave the treaty if \"extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country\", giving three months' (ninety days') notice. The state is required to give reasons for leaving the NPT in this notice.\n\n[[NATO]] states argue that when there is a state of \"general war\" the treaty no longer applies, effectively allowing the states involved to leave the treaty with no notice. This is a necessary argument to support the NATO [[nuclear weapons sharing]] policy, but a troubling one for the logic of the treaty. NATO's argument is based on the phrase \"the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war\" in the treaty preamble, inserted at the behest of U.S. diplomats, arguing that the treaty would at that point have failed to fulfill its function of prohibiting a general war and thus no longer be binding.<ref name=\"is_it_legal\"/> Many states do not accept this argument.{{who|date=April 2018}} See [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty#United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing|United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing]] above.\n\nNorth Korea has also caused an uproar by its use of this provision of the treaty. Article X.1 only requires a state to give three months' notice in total, and does not provide for other states to question a state's interpretation of \"supreme interests of its country\". In 1993, North Korea gave notice to withdraw from the NPT. However, after 89 days, North Korea reached agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear program under the [[Agreed Framework]] and \"suspended\" its withdrawal notice. In October 2002, the United States accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework by pursuing a secret uranium enrichment program, and suspended shipments of heavy fuel oil under that agreement. In response, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, disabled IAEA equipment, and, on 10 January 2003, announced that it was ending the suspension of its previous NPT withdrawal notification. North Korea said that only one more day's notice was sufficient for withdrawal from the NPT, as it had given 89 days before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |title=North Korea Profile \u2013 Nuclear Overview |publisher=Nti.org |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922050752/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |archive-date=22 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe IAEA Board of Governors rejected this interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/MediaAdvisory/2003/med-advise_048.shtml |title=Media Advisory 2003/48 \u2013 IAEA Board of Governors Adopts Resolution on Safeguards in North Korea \u2013 12 February |publisher=Iaea.org |date= 11 February 2003|accessdate=25 November 2010}}</ref> Most countries held that a new three-months withdrawal notice was required, and some questioned whether North Korea's notification met the \"extraordinary events\" and \"supreme interests\" requirements of the treaty.

Even though the treaty was originally conceived with a limited duration of 25 years, the signing parties decided, by consensus, to unconditionally extend the treaty indefinitely during the Review Conference in New York City on 11 May 1995, in the culmination of U.S. government efforts led by Ambassador [[Thomas Graham Jr. (diplomat)|Thomas Graham Jr.]]\n\nAt the time the NPT was proposed, there were predictions of 25\u201330 nuclear weapon states within 20 years.

They express disappointment with the limited progress on nuclear disarmament, where the five authorized nuclear weapons states still have 22,000 warheads in their combined stockpile and have shown a reluctance to disarm further.{{dubious|date=September 2011}} Several high-ranking officials within the United Nations have said that they can do little to stop states using [[nuclear reactor]]s to produce nuclear weapons.{{dubious|date=September 2011}}<ref name=bks2011>[[Benjamin K.

An effective nonproliferation regime whose members comply with their obligations provides an essential foundation for progress on disarmament and makes possible greater cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. With the right to access the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology comes the responsibility of nonproliferation. Progress on disarmament reinforces efforts to strengthen the nonproliferation regime and to enforce compliance with obligations, thereby also facilitating peaceful nuclear cooperation.<ref name=\"state.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/141503.pdf|work=U.S. Department of State / U.S. delegation to the 2010 nuclear nonproliferation treaty conference |title=Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|date=2010}}</ref>\nThe \"pillars\" concept has been questioned by some who believe that the NPT is, as its name suggests, principally about nonproliferation, and who worry that \"three pillars\" language misleadingly implies that the three elements have equivalent importance.<ref>This view was expressed by Christopher Ford, the U.S. NPT representative at the end of the Bush Administration.

NNWS parties to the NPT agree not to \"receive\", \"manufacture\", or \"acquire\" nuclear weapons or to \"seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons\" (Article II). NNWS parties also agree to accept safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify that they are not diverting nuclear energy<!--\"Nuclear energy\" is verbatim from the English text of the treaty. Do not change to \"nuclear material.\"--> from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other [[nuclear explosive]] devices (Article III).\n\nThe five NWS parties have made undertakings not to use their nuclear weapons against a non-NWS party except in response to a nuclear attack, or a conventional attack in alliance with a Nuclear Weapons State. However, these undertakings have not been incorporated formally into the treaty, and the exact details have varied over time. The U.S. also had nuclear warheads targeted at North Korea, a non-NWS, from 1959 until 1991. The previous United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[Geoff Hoon]], has also explicitly invoked the possibility of the use of the country's nuclear weapons in response to a non-conventional attack by \"[[rogue states]]\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1883258.stm UK 'prepared to use nuclear weapons'] BBC article dated 20 March 2002</ref> In January 2006, President [[Jacques Chirac]] of France indicated that an incident of state-sponsored terrorism on France could trigger a small-scale nuclear retaliation aimed at destroying the \"rogue state's\" power centers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4627862.stm France 'would use nuclear arms'], BBC article dated 19 January 2006</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903311.html Chirac: Nuclear Response to Terrorism Is Possible], Washington Post article dated 20 January 2006</ref>\n\n===Second pillar: Disarmament===\nUnder Article VI of the NPT, all Parties undertake to pursue good-faith negotiations on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race, to nuclear disarmament, and to general and complete disarmament.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\nArticle VI of the NPT represents the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states. The NPT's preamble contains language affirming the desire of treaty signatories to ease international tension and strengthen international trust so as to create someday the conditions for a halt to the production of nuclear weapons, and treaty on general and complete disarmament that liquidates, in particular, nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles from national arsenals.\n\nThe wording of the NPT's Article VI arguably imposes only a vague obligation on all NPT signatories to move in the general direction of nuclear and total disarmament, saying, \"Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf |title=Information Circulars |work=iaea.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807060917/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2007 }}</ref> Under this interpretation, Article VI does not strictly require all signatories to actually conclude a disarmament treaty.

It was recognized that the [[Cold War]] deterrent relationship between just the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] was fragile. Having more nuclear-weapon states would reduce security for all, multiplying the risks of miscalculation, accidents, unauthorized use of weapons, escalation in tensions, and nuclear conflict. Moreover, since the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, it has been apparent that the development of nuclear capabilities by States could enable them to divert technology and materials for weapons purposes. Thus, the problem of preventing such diversions became a central issue in discussions on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nInitial efforts, which began in 1946, to create an international system enabling all States to have access to nuclear technology under appropriate safeguards, were terminated in 1949 without the achievement of this objective, due to serious political differences between the major Powers. By then, both the United States and the former Soviet Union had tested nuclear weapons, and were beginning to build their stockpiles.\n\nIn December 1953, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his \"[[Atoms for Peace]]\" proposal, presented to the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly, urged that an international organization be established to disseminate peaceful nuclear technology, while guarding against development of weapons capabilities in additional countries. His proposal resulted in 1957 in the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was charged with the dual responsibility for promotion and control of nuclear technology. IAEA technical activities began in 1958. An interim safeguards system for small nuclear reactors, put in place in 1961, was replaced in 1964 by a system covering larger installations and, over the following years, was expanded to include additional nuclear facilities. In recent years, efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the IAEA safeguards system culminated in the approval of the Model Additional Protocol by the IAEA Board of Governors in May 1997.\n\nWithin the framework of the United Nations, the principle of nuclear non-proliferation was addressed in negotiations as early as 1957. The NPT process was launched by [[Frank Aiken]], Irish Minister for External Affairs, in 1958. The NPT gained significant momentum in the early 1960s. The structure of a treaty to uphold nuclear non-proliferation as a norm of international behaviour had become clear by the mid-1960s, and by 1968 final agreement had been reached on a Treaty that would prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, enable cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament. It was opened for signature in 1968, with Finland the first [[List of parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|State to sign]]. Accession became nearly universal after the end of the [[Cold War]] and of South African [[apartheid]]. In 1992, The People's Republic of China and France acceded to the NPT, the last of the five nuclear powers recognized by the treaty to do so.\n\nThe treaty provided, in article X, for a conference to be convened 25 years after its entry into force to decide whether the treaty should continue in force indefinitely, or be extended for an additional fixed period or periods. Accordingly, at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in May 1995, state parties to the treaty agreed-without a vote-on the treaty's indefinite extension, and decided that review conferences should continue to be held every five years. After Brazil acceded to the NPT in 1998, the only remaining non-nuclear-weapon state which had not signed was Cuba, which joined the NPT (and the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] [[NWFZ]]) in 2002.\n\nSeveral NPT states parties have given up nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons programs. South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons program, but has since renounced it and acceded to the treaty in 1991 after destroying its small nuclear [[arsenal]]; after this, the remaining African countries signed the treaty. The [[former Soviet Republics]] where nuclear weapons had been based, namely Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, transferred those weapons to Russia and joined the NPT by 1994 following the signature of the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nSuccessor states from the breakups of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia also joined the treaty soon after their independence. Montenegro and East Timor were the last countries to accede to the treaty on their independence in 2006 and 2003; the only other country to accede in the 21st century was Cuba in 2002. The three Micronesian countries in [[Compact of Free Association]] with the USA joined the NPT in 1995, along with Vanuatu.\n\nMajor South American countries Argentina, Chile, and Brazil joined in 1995 and 1998. Arabian Peninsula countries included Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1988, Qatar and Kuwait in 1989, UAE in 1995, and Oman in 1997. The European states of [[Monaco]] and [[Andorra]] joined in 1995\u20136. Also acceding in the 1990s were Myanmar in 1992 and Guyana in 1993.\n\n===United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing===\n{{Main|Nuclear sharing}}\n[[File:nwfz.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|\n{{legend0|#0000FF|[[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]]s}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF0000|[[Nuclear weapons states]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#FF8800|[[Nuclear sharing]]}}<br/>\n{{legend0|#dddd00|Neither, but NPT}} ]]\n\nAt the time the treaty was being negotiated, [[NATO]] had in place secret [[Nuclear sharing|nuclear weapons sharing]] agreements whereby the United States provided nuclear weapons to be deployed by, and stored in, other NATO states.

A counter-argument is that the U.S. controlled the weapons in storage within the NATO states, and that no transfer of the weapons or control over them was intended \"unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the treaty would no longer be controlling\", so there is no breach of the NPT.<ref name=Donnelly>{{citation|url=http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm |title=The Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Articles I, II and VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons |author=Brian Donnelly, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] |publisher=Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean |accessdate=2009-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105200406/http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm |archivedate=5 January 2009 }}</ref> These agreements were disclosed to a few of the states, including the [[Soviet Union]], negotiating the treaty, but most of the states that signed the NPT in 1968 would not have known about these agreements and interpretations at that time.<ref name=\"is_it_legal\">Otfried Nassauer, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (ieer.org), Science for Democratic Action Volume 9 Number 3, May 2001, [http://www.ieer.org/sdafiles/vol_9/9-3/nato.html Nuclear Sharing in NATO: Is it Legal?]</ref>\n\nAs of 2005, it is estimated that the United States still provides about 180 tactical [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s for use by Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey under these NATO agreements.<ref name=\"nrdc eur\">Hans M.

This led to the development of a secret nuclear weapons program as an ultimate deterrent. South Africa has a large supply of uranium, which is mined in the country's gold mines. The government built a nuclear research facility at [[Pelindaba]] near Pretoria where uranium was enriched to fuel grade for the [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]] as well as weapon grade for bomb production.\n\nIn 1991, after international pressure and when a change of government was imminent, South African Ambassador to the United States [[Harry Schwarz]] signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1993, the then president [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] openly admitted that the country had developed a limited nuclear weapon capability. These weapons were subsequently dismantled before South Africa acceded to the NPT and opened itself up to IAEA inspection. In 1994, the IAEA completed its work and declared that the country had fully dismantled its nuclear weapons program.\n\n===Libya===\n{{See also|Libya and weapons of mass destruction}}\nLibya had signed (in 1968) and ratified (in 1975) the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and was subject to IAEA nuclear safeguards inspections, but undertook a secret nuclear weapons development program in violation of its NPT obligations, using material and technology provided by the [[A.Q.

Before the advent of the [[Syrian Civil War]] it was known to operate only one small Chinese-built research reactor, SRR-1. Despite being a proponent of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East the country was accused of pursuing a military nuclear program with a reported nuclear facility in a desert Syrian region of Deir ez-Zor. The reactor's components had likely been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor's striking similarity in shape and size to the North Korean Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. That information alarmed Israeli military and intelligence to such a degree that the idea of a targeted airstrike was conceived. It resulted in [[Operation Orchard]], that took place on 6 September 2007  and saw as many as eight Israeli aircraft taking part. The Israeli government is said to have bounced the idea of the operation off of the US Bush administration, although the latter declined to participate. The nuclear reactor was destroyed in the attack, which also killed about ten North Korean workers. The attack did not cause an international outcry or any serious Syrian retaliatory moves as both parties tried to keep it secret: Despite a half-century state of war declared by surrounding states Israel didn't want publicity as regards its breach of the ceasefire while Syria wasn't willing to acknowledge its clandestine nuclear program.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Leaving the treaty==\nArticle X allows a state to leave the treaty if \"extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country\", giving three months' (ninety days') notice. The state is required to give reasons for leaving the NPT in this notice.\n\n[[NATO]] states argue that when there is a state of \"general war\" the treaty no longer applies, effectively allowing the states involved to leave the treaty with no notice. This is a necessary argument to support the NATO [[nuclear weapons sharing]] policy, but a troubling one for the logic of the treaty. NATO's argument is based on the phrase \"the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war\" in the treaty preamble, inserted at the behest of U.S. diplomats, arguing that the treaty would at that point have failed to fulfill its function of prohibiting a general war and thus no longer be binding.<ref name=\"is_it_legal\"/> Many states do not accept this argument.{{who|date=April 2018}} See [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty#United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing|United States\u2013NATO nuclear weapons sharing]] above.\n\nNorth Korea has also caused an uproar by its use of this provision of the treaty. Article X.1 only requires a state to give three months' notice in total, and does not provide for other states to question a state's interpretation of \"supreme interests of its country\". In 1993, North Korea gave notice to withdraw from the NPT. However, after 89 days, North Korea reached agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear program under the [[Agreed Framework]] and \"suspended\" its withdrawal notice. In October 2002, the United States accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework by pursuing a secret uranium enrichment program, and suspended shipments of heavy fuel oil under that agreement. In response, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, disabled IAEA equipment, and, on 10 January 2003, announced that it was ending the suspension of its previous NPT withdrawal notification. North Korea said that only one more day's notice was sufficient for withdrawal from the NPT, as it had given 89 days before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |title=North Korea Profile \u2013 Nuclear Overview |publisher=Nti.org |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922050752/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |archive-date=22 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe IAEA Board of Governors rejected this interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/MediaAdvisory/2003/med-advise_048.shtml |title=Media Advisory 2003/48 \u2013 IAEA Board of Governors Adopts Resolution on Safeguards in North Korea \u2013 12 February |publisher=Iaea.org |date= 11 February 2003|accessdate=25 November 2010}}</ref> Most countries held that a new three-months withdrawal notice was required, and some questioned whether North Korea's notification met the \"extraordinary events\" and \"supreme interests\" requirements of the treaty.

The film was followed by [[stand-alone sequel]] ''[[Weathering with You]]'' in 2019, in which Taki and Mitsuha appear in supporting roles. An American live-action remake set in the United States is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nMitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori in Japan's mountainous [[Hida region]]. She is bored with country life and wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, their phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.\n\nOne day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol ''[[kuchikamizake]]'', made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the family [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about the comet [[Tiamat]] expected to pass Earth on the day of her town [[Japanese festivals|festival]].\n\nThe next day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha but cannot reach her, and the body-switching ends. He decides to meet her directly, but not knowing the town's name he has to rely on his memories of the scenery. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two; the larger piece kept moving, but the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that Mitsuha was dead this whole time, her messages on his phone disappear and his memories start fading away. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years.\n\nTaki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that the girl who acted like she knew him that he had encountered in the past was Mitsuha: not knowing they were separated by three years, she, having fallen in love with him, had met his past self while trying to meet with him personally. He wakes up in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what is happening and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends, Tessie and Sayaka, to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a [[Broadcast signal intrusion|false emergency alert]], but the plan fails. Realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine, he goes back to find her.\n\nMitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. When Taki reaches the shrine as the sun is setting, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years. However, when twilight falls (referred to in the film as \"magic hour\"),{{refn|group=\"note\"|\"Kataware-Doki,\" the word Taki and Mitsuha use, is turned from \"kawatare-doki,\" an old Japanese word meaning twilight. \"Kawatare\" (\u5f7c\u306f\u8ab0) literally means \"Who is he/she?\"; \"kataware\" also has the same sound as a word meaning one of the couple (\u7247\u5272\u308c). In old Japan, people believed that supernatural occurrences were possible at twilight.}} they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.\n\nAs Mitsuha races back to convince her father, the town mayor, to evacuate the town, her memories of Taki start to fade, and discovers that Taki wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. The comet piece crashes to Earth, destroying the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing.\n\nFive years later, Taki has graduated from university and is searching for a job. He senses he is missing something important, and learns that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. They initially walk past each other, before Taki uneasily asks Mitsuha if he had met her before, and she replies that she felt the same way: their connection reestablishing, they shed tears of happiness, and simultaneously ask for each other's names.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The film was followed by [[stand-alone sequel]] ''[[Weathering with You]]'' in 2019, in which Taki and Mitsuha appear in supporting roles. An American live-action remake set in the United States is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nMitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori in Japan's mountainous [[Hida region]]. She is bored with country life and wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, their phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.\n\nOne day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol ''[[kuchikamizake]]'', made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the family [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about the comet [[Tiamat]] expected to pass Earth on the day of her town [[Japanese festivals|festival]].\n\nThe next day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha but cannot reach her, and the body-switching ends. He decides to meet her directly, but not knowing the town's name he has to rely on his memories of the scenery. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two; the larger piece kept moving, but the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that Mitsuha was dead this whole time, her messages on his phone disappear and his memories start fading away. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years.\n\nTaki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that the girl who acted like she knew him that he had encountered in the past was Mitsuha: not knowing they were separated by three years, she, having fallen in love with him, had met his past self while trying to meet with him personally. He wakes up in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what is happening and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends, Tessie and Sayaka, to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a [[Broadcast signal intrusion|false emergency alert]], but the plan fails. Realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine, he goes back to find her.\n\nMitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. When Taki reaches the shrine as the sun is setting, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years. However, when twilight falls (referred to in the film as \"magic hour\"),{{refn|group=\"note\"|\"Kataware-Doki,\" the word Taki and Mitsuha use, is turned from \"kawatare-doki,\" an old Japanese word meaning twilight. \"Kawatare\" (\u5f7c\u306f\u8ab0) literally means \"Who is he/she?\"; \"kataware\" also has the same sound as a word meaning one of the couple (\u7247\u5272\u308c). In old Japan, people believed that supernatural occurrences were possible at twilight.}} they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.\n\nAs Mitsuha races back to convince her father, the town mayor, to evacuate the town, her memories of Taki start to fade, and discovers that Taki wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. The comet piece crashes to Earth, destroying the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing.\n\nFive years later, Taki has graduated from university and is searching for a job. He senses he is missing something important, and learns that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. They initially walk past each other, before Taki uneasily asks Mitsuha if he had met her before, and she replies that she felt the same way: their connection reestablishing, they shed tears of happiness, and simultaneously ask for each other's names.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!
