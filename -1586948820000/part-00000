Sieve tube cells do contain [[vacuole]]s and other organelles, such as [[ribosome]]s, before they mature, but these generally migrate to the cell wall and dissolve at maturity; this ensures there is little to impede the movement of fluids. One of the few organelles they do contain at maturity is the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]], which can be found at the plasma membrane, often nearby the [[plasmodesmata]] that connect them to their companion or albuminous cells.

[[Halogenated]] compounds also exhibit great [[Chemical stability|stability]] reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward [[hydrolysis]] and [[Photodissociation|photolytic degradation]].  The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern.

The UNEP decided that POP regulation needed to be addressed globally for the future. The purpose statement of the agreement is \"to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants.\" As of 2014, there are 179 countries in compliance with the Stockholm convention. The convention and its participants have recognized the potential human and environmental toxicity of POPs. They recognize that POPs have the potential for long range transport and bioaccumulation and biomagnification. The convention seeks to study and then judge whether or not a number of chemicals that have been developed with advances in technology and science can be categorized as POPs or not. The initial meeting in 2001 made a preliminary list, termed the \"dirty dozen,\" of chemicals that are classified as POPs. As of 2014, the [[United States of America]] has signed the Stockholm Convention but has not ratified it. There are a handful of other countries that have not ratified the convention but most countries in the world have ratified the convention.<ref>\"STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS\". pp. 1\u201343.</ref>\n\n=== Compounds on the Stockholm Convention list ===\nIn May 1995, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Governing Council investigated POPs.<ref name=\"thedirtydozen\">{{cite web|title=The Dirty Dozen|url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/29239_popspresentation.swf|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> Initially the Convention recognized only twelve POPs for their adverse effects on human health and the environment, placing a global ban on these particularly harmful and toxic compounds and requiring its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs in the environment.\n<ref name=\"El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF| title=STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS| pages=1\u201343| accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chm.pops.int/ | title=Home}}</ref>\n\n#'''[[Aldrin]]''', an insecticide used in soils to kill [[termite]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[Western corn rootworm]], and others, is also known to kill birds, fish, and humans. Humans are primarily exposed to aldrin through dairy products and animal meats.\n#'''[[Chlordane]]''', an insecticide used to control termites and on a range of agricultural crops, is known to be lethal in various species of birds, including mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp; it is a chemical that remains in the soil with a reported [[half-life]] of one year. Chlordane has been postulated to affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human [[carcinogen]]. Chlordane air pollution is believed the primary route of humane exposure.\n#'''[[Dieldrin]]''', a pesticide used to control termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to dieldrin. Dieldrin\u2019s half-life is approximately five years. [[Dieldrin]] is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. Dieldrin has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]], [[breast cancer]], and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to dieldrin primarily derives from food.\n#'''[[Endrin]]''', an insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize endrin, so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. Endrin is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.\n#'''[[Heptachlor]]''', a [[pesticide]] primarily used to kill soil insects and termites, along with cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Heptachlor, even at every low doses has been associated with the decline of several wild bird populations \u2013 [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[American kestrel]]s. In laboratory tests have shown high-dose heptachlor as lethal, with adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success at low-doses, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Human exposure primarily results from food.\n#'''[[Hexachlorobenzene]] (HCB'''), was first introduced in 1945\u201359 to treat seeds because it can kill [[Fungicide|fungi]] on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, [[colic]], debilitation, and a [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic disorder]] called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.\n#'''[[Mirex]]''', an insecticide used against ants and termites or as a [[flame retardant]] in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods. Mirex is one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half-life of up to 10 years.  Mirex is toxic to several plant, fish and [[crustacean]] species, with suggested carcinogenic capacity in humans. Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.\n#'''[[Toxaphene]]''', an insecticide used on cotton, cereal, grain, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, as well as for tick and mite control in livestock. Widespread toxaphene use in the US and chemical persistence, with a half-life of up to 12 years in soil, results in residual toxaphene in the environment. Toxaphene is highly toxic to fish, inducing dramatic weight loss and reduced egg viability. Human exposure primarily results from food. While human toxicity to direct toxaphene exposure is low, the compound is classified as a possible human carcinogen.\n#'''[[Polychlorinated biphenyls]]''' (PCBs), used as [[Heat-transfer oil|heat exchange fluids]], in [[transformer|electrical transformers]], and [[capacitor]]s, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics. Persistence varies with degree of [[halogenation]], an estimated half-life of 10 years. PCBs are toxic to fish at high doses, and associated with spawning failure at low doses. Human exposure occurs through food, and is associated with reproductive failure and immune suppression. Immediate effects of PCB exposure include pigmentation of nails and [[mucous membranes]] and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Effects are [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational]], as the chemical can persist in a mother\u2019s body for up to 7 years, resulting in developmental delays and behavioral problems in her children. Food contamination has led to large scale PCB exposure.\n#[[DDT|'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''']] (DDT) is probably the most infamous POP. It was widely used as insecticide during WWII to protect against malaria and typhus. After the war, DDT was used as an agricultural insecticide. In 1962, the American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] published [[Silent Spring]], describing the impact of DDT spraying on the US environment and human health. DDT\u2019s persistence in the soil for up to 10\u201315 years after application has resulted in widespread and persistent DDT residues throughout the world including the arctic, even though it has been banned or severely restricted in most of the world. DDT is toxic to many organisms including birds where it is detrimental to reproduction due to eggshell thinning. DDT can be detected in foods from all over the world and food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of human exposure. Short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, however long-term exposure has been associated with chronic health effects including increased risk of cancer and diabetes, reduced reproductive success, and neurological disease.\n#'''[[Dioxins]]''' are unintentional by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete combustion and pesticide production. Dioxins are typically emitted from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and [[hazardous waste]], along with automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. Dioxins have been associated with several adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders, [[chloracne]], and are classified as a possible human carcinogen. In laboratory studies of dioxin effects an increase in birth defects and stillbirths, and lethal exposure have been associated with the substances. Food, particularly from animals, is the principal source of human exposure to dioxins.\n#'''[[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]]''' are by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete [[combustion]] after [[Incineration|waste incineration]] or in automobiles, pesticide production, and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] production. Structurally similar to dioxins, the two compounds share toxic effects. Furans persist in the environment and classified as possible human carcinogens. Human exposure to furans primarily results from food, particularly animal products.\n\n=== New POPs on the Stockholm Convention list ===\nSince 2001, this list has been expanded to include some [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and other compounds. Additions to the initial 2001 Stockholm Convention list are as following POPs:<ref>{{citation | title = Depositary notification | url = http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP-NOTIF-DN-CN524-2009.English.pdf | publisher = Secretary-General of the United Nations | date = 26 August 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-17}}.</ref><ref>https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf</ref>\n*[[Chlordecone]], a synthetic chlorinated organic compound, is primarily used as an agricultural pesticide, related to DDT and Mirex. Chlordecone is toxic to aquatic organisms, and classified as a possible human carcinogen. Many countries have banned chlordecone sale and use, or intend to phase out stockpiles and wastes.\n*[[alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane|\u03b1-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (\u03b1-HCH) and [[beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane|\u03b2-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (\u03b2-HCH) are insecticides as well as by-products in the production of [[lindane]].  Large stockpiles of HCH isomers exist in the environment. \u03b1-HCH and \u03b2-HCH are highly persistent in the water of colder regions. \u03b1-HCH and \u03b2-HCH has been linked [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n*[[Hexabromodiphenyl ether]] (hexaBDE) and [[heptabromodiphenyl ether]] (heptaBDE) are main components of commercial [[octabromodiphenyl ether]] (octaBDE). Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination and the production of [[Bromodiphenylmethane|bromodiphenyl ethers]], which can increase toxicity.\n*[[Lindane]] (\u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane), a pesticide used as a broad spectrum insecticide for seed, soil, leaf, tree and wood treatment, and against [[ectoparasite]]s in animals and humans (head lice and scabies). Lindane rapidly [[Bioconcentration|bioconcentrates]]. It is [[Immunotoxin|immunotoxic]], [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]], [[carcinogenic]], linked to liver and kidney damage as well as adverse reproductive and developmental effects in laboratory animals and aquatic organisms. Production of lindane unintentionally produces two other POPs \u03b1-HCH and \u03b2-HCH.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n*[[Pentachlorobenzene]] (PeCB), is a pesticide and unintentional byproduct. PeCB has also been used in PCB products, dyestuff carriers, as a fungicide, a flame retardant, and a chemical intermediate. PeCB is moderately toxic to humane, while highly toxic to aquatic organisms.\n*[[Tetrabromodiphenyl ether]] (tetraBDE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) are industrial chemicals and the main components of commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). PentaBDE has been detected in humans in all regions of the world.\n*[[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and its salts are used in the production of fluoropolymers. PFOS and related compounds are extremely persistent, bioaccumulating and [[Biomagnification|biomagnifying]].  The negative effects of trace levels of PFOS have not been established.\n*[[Endosulfan]]s are insecticides to control pests on crops such coffee, cotton, rice and sorghum and soybeans, tsetse flies, ectoparasites of cattle. They are used as a [[Wood preservation|wood preservative]]. Global use and manufacturing of endosulfan has been banned under the Stockholm convention in 2011, although many countries had previously banned or introduced phase-outs of the chemical when the ban was announced. Toxic to humans and aquatic and terrestrial organisms, linked to congenital physical disorders, mental retardation, and death. Endosulfans' negative health effects are primarily liked to its endocrine disrupting capacity acting as an [[antiandrogen]].\n*[[Hexabromocyclododecane]] (HBCD) is a [[brominated flame retardant]] primarily used in [[thermal insulation]] in the building industry. HBCD is persistent, toxic and [[Ecotoxicity|ecotoxic]], with [[bioaccumulative]] and long-range transport properties.\n\n== Health effects ==\nPOP exposure may cause developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], possibly including [[breast cancer]].<ref name=\"ritter\"/> Many POPs are capable of [[endocrine disruption]] within the [[reproductive system]], the [[central nervous system]], or the [[immune system]]. People and animals are exposed to POPs mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb.<ref name=\"ritter\"/>  For humans not exposed to POPs through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.<ref name=\"Vallack, H.W. 1998\"/>\n\nStudies have investigated the correlation between low level exposure of POPs and various diseases. In order to assess disease risk due to POPs in a particular location, government agencies may produce a [[human health risk assessment]] which takes into account the pollutants' [[bioavailability]] and their [[dose-response relationship]]s.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |pages= 579\u2013618|editor= A.

Low level exposure to POPs during critical [[developmental biology|developmental]] periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout their lifespan. A 2002 study<ref name=\"Damstra, T. 2002\">{{cite journal | author = Damstra T | year = 2002 | title = Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children | url = | journal = Clinical Toxicology | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 457\u2013465 }}</ref> summarizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure to POPs during critical developmental stages in an organism\u2019s lifespan. The study aimed to answer the question whether or not chronic, low level exposure to POPs can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are [[in utero]], [[in ovo]], and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during [[prenatal development|fetal development]].<ref name=\"Damstra, T. 2002\"/>\n\n=== Reproductive system ===\nThe same study in 2002<ref name=\"Damstra, T. 2002\"/> with evidence of a link from POPs to [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]] also linked low dose exposure of POPs to [[reproductive health]] effects.

For this reason, they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in [[Adipose tissue|fatty tissues]]. [[Halogenated]] compounds also exhibit great [[Chemical stability|stability]] reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward [[hydrolysis]] and [[Photodissociation|photolytic degradation]].  The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern.  They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels.<ref name=\"Walker, C.H. 2001\">Walker, C.H., \"Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective\" (2001).</ref> Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances|PBTs]] ('''P'''ersistent, '''B'''ioaccumulative and '''T'''oxic) or TOMPs ('''T'''oxic '''O'''rganic '''M'''icro '''P'''ollutants).\n\n=== Long-range transport ===\nPOPs enter the [[gas]] phase under certain environmental temperatures and [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatize]] from [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], and [[bodies of water]] into the [[atmosphere]], resisting breakdown reactions in the air, to travel long distances before being re-deposited.<ref name=\"Kelly, B.C. 2007\">Kelly, B.C., Ikonomou, M.G., Blair, J.D., Morin, A.E., Gobas, F.A.P.C.

The UNEP decided that POP regulation needed to be addressed globally for the future. The purpose statement of the agreement is \"to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants.\" As of 2014, there are 179 countries in compliance with the Stockholm convention. The convention and its participants have recognized the potential human and environmental toxicity of POPs. They recognize that POPs have the potential for long range transport and bioaccumulation and biomagnification. The convention seeks to study and then judge whether or not a number of chemicals that have been developed with advances in technology and science can be categorized as POPs or not. The initial meeting in 2001 made a preliminary list, termed the \"dirty dozen,\" of chemicals that are classified as POPs. As of 2014, the [[United States of America]] has signed the Stockholm Convention but has not ratified it. There are a handful of other countries that have not ratified the convention but most countries in the world have ratified the convention.<ref>\"STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS\". pp. 1\u201343.</ref>\n\n=== Compounds on the Stockholm Convention list ===\nIn May 1995, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Governing Council investigated POPs.<ref name=\"thedirtydozen\">{{cite web|title=The Dirty Dozen|url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/29239_popspresentation.swf|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> Initially the Convention recognized only twelve POPs for their adverse effects on human health and the environment, placing a global ban on these particularly harmful and toxic compounds and requiring its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs in the environment.\n<ref name=\"El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF| title=STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS| pages=1\u201343| accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chm.pops.int/ | title=Home}}</ref>\n\n#'''[[Aldrin]]''', an insecticide used in soils to kill [[termite]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[Western corn rootworm]], and others, is also known to kill birds, fish, and humans. Humans are primarily exposed to aldrin through dairy products and animal meats.\n#'''[[Chlordane]]''', an insecticide used to control termites and on a range of agricultural crops, is known to be lethal in various species of birds, including mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp; it is a chemical that remains in the soil with a reported [[half-life]] of one year. Chlordane has been postulated to affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human [[carcinogen]]. Chlordane air pollution is believed the primary route of humane exposure.\n#'''[[Dieldrin]]''', a pesticide used to control termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to dieldrin. Dieldrin\u2019s half-life is approximately five years. [[Dieldrin]] is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. Dieldrin has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]], [[breast cancer]], and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to dieldrin primarily derives from food.\n#'''[[Endrin]]''', an insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize endrin, so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. Endrin is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.\n#'''[[Heptachlor]]''', a [[pesticide]] primarily used to kill soil insects and termites, along with cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Heptachlor, even at every low doses has been associated with the decline of several wild bird populations \u2013 [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[American kestrel]]s. In laboratory tests have shown high-dose heptachlor as lethal, with adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success at low-doses, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Human exposure primarily results from food.\n#'''[[Hexachlorobenzene]] (HCB'''), was first introduced in 1945\u201359 to treat seeds because it can kill [[Fungicide|fungi]] on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, [[colic]], debilitation, and a [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic disorder]] called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.\n#'''[[Mirex]]''', an insecticide used against ants and termites or as a [[flame retardant]] in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods. Mirex is one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half-life of up to 10 years.  Mirex is toxic to several plant, fish and [[crustacean]] species, with suggested carcinogenic capacity in humans. Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.\n#'''[[Toxaphene]]''', an insecticide used on cotton, cereal, grain, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, as well as for tick and mite control in livestock. Widespread toxaphene use in the US and chemical persistence, with a half-life of up to 12 years in soil, results in residual toxaphene in the environment. Toxaphene is highly toxic to fish, inducing dramatic weight loss and reduced egg viability. Human exposure primarily results from food. While human toxicity to direct toxaphene exposure is low, the compound is classified as a possible human carcinogen.\n#'''[[Polychlorinated biphenyls]]''' (PCBs), used as [[Heat-transfer oil|heat exchange fluids]], in [[transformer|electrical transformers]], and [[capacitor]]s, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics. Persistence varies with degree of [[halogenation]], an estimated half-life of 10 years. PCBs are toxic to fish at high doses, and associated with spawning failure at low doses. Human exposure occurs through food, and is associated with reproductive failure and immune suppression. Immediate effects of PCB exposure include pigmentation of nails and [[mucous membranes]] and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Effects are [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational]], as the chemical can persist in a mother\u2019s body for up to 7 years, resulting in developmental delays and behavioral problems in her children. Food contamination has led to large scale PCB exposure.\n#[[DDT|'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''']] (DDT) is probably the most infamous POP. It was widely used as insecticide during WWII to protect against malaria and typhus. After the war, DDT was used as an agricultural insecticide. In 1962, the American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] published [[Silent Spring]], describing the impact of DDT spraying on the US environment and human health. DDT\u2019s persistence in the soil for up to 10\u201315 years after application has resulted in widespread and persistent DDT residues throughout the world including the arctic, even though it has been banned or severely restricted in most of the world. DDT is toxic to many organisms including birds where it is detrimental to reproduction due to eggshell thinning. DDT can be detected in foods from all over the world and food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of human exposure. Short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, however long-term exposure has been associated with chronic health effects including increased risk of cancer and diabetes, reduced reproductive success, and neurological disease.\n#'''[[Dioxins]]''' are unintentional by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete combustion and pesticide production. Dioxins are typically emitted from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and [[hazardous waste]], along with automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. Dioxins have been associated with several adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders, [[chloracne]], and are classified as a possible human carcinogen. In laboratory studies of dioxin effects an increase in birth defects and stillbirths, and lethal exposure have been associated with the substances. Food, particularly from animals, is the principal source of human exposure to dioxins.\n#'''[[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]]''' are by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete [[combustion]] after [[Incineration|waste incineration]] or in automobiles, pesticide production, and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] production. Structurally similar to dioxins, the two compounds share toxic effects. Furans persist in the environment and classified as possible human carcinogens. Human exposure to furans primarily results from food, particularly animal products.\n\n=== New POPs on the Stockholm Convention list ===\nSince 2001, this list has been expanded to include some [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and other compounds. Additions to the initial 2001 Stockholm Convention list are as following POPs:<ref>{{citation | title = Depositary notification | url = http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP-NOTIF-DN-CN524-2009.English.pdf | publisher = Secretary-General of the United Nations | date = 26 August 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-17}}.</ref><ref>https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf</ref>\n*[[Chlordecone]], a synthetic chlorinated organic compound, is primarily used as an agricultural pesticide, related to DDT and Mirex. Chlordecone is toxic to aquatic organisms, and classified as a possible human carcinogen. Many countries have banned chlordecone sale and use, or intend to phase out stockpiles and wastes.\n*[[alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane|\u03b1-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (\u03b1-HCH) and [[beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane|\u03b2-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (\u03b2-HCH) are insecticides as well as by-products in the production of [[lindane]].  Large stockpiles of HCH isomers exist in the environment. \u03b1-HCH and \u03b2-HCH are highly persistent in the water of colder regions. \u03b1-HCH and \u03b2-HCH has been linked [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n*[[Hexabromodiphenyl ether]] (hexaBDE) and [[heptabromodiphenyl ether]] (heptaBDE) are main components of commercial [[octabromodiphenyl ether]] (octaBDE). Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination and the production of [[Bromodiphenylmethane|bromodiphenyl ethers]], which can increase toxicity.\n*[[Lindane]] (\u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane), a pesticide used as a broad spectrum insecticide for seed, soil, leaf, tree and wood treatment, and against [[ectoparasite]]s in animals and humans (head lice and scabies). Lindane rapidly [[Bioconcentration|bioconcentrates]]. It is [[Immunotoxin|immunotoxic]], [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]], [[carcinogenic]], linked to liver and kidney damage as well as adverse reproductive and developmental effects in laboratory animals and aquatic organisms. Production of lindane unintentionally produces two other POPs \u03b1-HCH and \u03b2-HCH.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n*[[Pentachlorobenzene]] (PeCB), is a pesticide and unintentional byproduct. PeCB has also been used in PCB products, dyestuff carriers, as a fungicide, a flame retardant, and a chemical intermediate. PeCB is moderately toxic to humane, while highly toxic to aquatic organisms.\n*[[Tetrabromodiphenyl ether]] (tetraBDE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) are industrial chemicals and the main components of commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). PentaBDE has been detected in humans in all regions of the world.\n*[[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and its salts are used in the production of fluoropolymers. PFOS and related compounds are extremely persistent, bioaccumulating and [[Biomagnification|biomagnifying]].  The negative effects of trace levels of PFOS have not been established.\n*[[Endosulfan]]s are insecticides to control pests on crops such coffee, cotton, rice and sorghum and soybeans, tsetse flies, ectoparasites of cattle. They are used as a [[Wood preservation|wood preservative]]. Global use and manufacturing of endosulfan has been banned under the Stockholm convention in 2011, although many countries had previously banned or introduced phase-outs of the chemical when the ban was announced. Toxic to humans and aquatic and terrestrial organisms, linked to congenital physical disorders, mental retardation, and death. Endosulfans' negative health effects are primarily liked to its endocrine disrupting capacity acting as an [[antiandrogen]].\n*[[Hexabromocyclododecane]] (HBCD) is a [[brominated flame retardant]] primarily used in [[thermal insulation]] in the building industry. HBCD is persistent, toxic and [[Ecotoxicity|ecotoxic]], with [[bioaccumulative]] and long-range transport properties.\n\n== Health effects ==\nPOP exposure may cause developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], possibly including [[breast cancer]].<ref name=\"ritter\"/> Many POPs are capable of [[endocrine disruption]] within the [[reproductive system]], the [[central nervous system]], or the [[immune system]]. People and animals are exposed to POPs mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb.<ref name=\"ritter\"/>  For humans not exposed to POPs through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.<ref name=\"Vallack, H.W. 1998\"/>\n\nStudies have investigated the correlation between low level exposure of POPs and various diseases. In order to assess disease risk due to POPs in a particular location, government agencies may produce a [[human health risk assessment]] which takes into account the pollutants' [[bioavailability]] and their [[dose-response relationship]]s.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |pages= 579\u2013618|editor= A.

Low level exposure to POPs during critical [[developmental biology|developmental]] periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout their lifespan. A 2002 study<ref name=\"Damstra, T. 2002\">Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457\u2013465.</ref> summarizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure to POPs during critical developmental stages in an organism\u2019s lifespan. The study aimed to answer the question whether or not chronic, low level exposure to POPs can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are [[in utero]], [[in ovo]], and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during [[prenatal development|fetal development]].<ref>Damstra, T. (2002).

The study stated that POP exposure can lead to negative health effects especially in the [[human male reproductive system|male reproductive system]], such as decreased [[sperm]] quality and quantity, altered sex ratio and early [[puberty]] onset. For females exposed to POPs, altered [[human female reproductive system|reproductive tissues]] and [[pregnancy]] outcomes as well as [[endometriosis]] have been reported.<ref>El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T.

For example, for organisms exposed to a mixture of POPs, the effects are assumed to be [[interaction|additive]].<ref name=\"Harrad, S. 2010\">ed. Harrad, S., \"Persistent Organic Pollutants\" (2010).</ref> Mixtures of POPs can in principle produce [[interaction|synergistic effects]]. With synergistic effects, the toxicity of each compound is enhanced (or depressed) by the presence of other compounds in the mixture. When put together, the effects can far exceed the approximated additive effects of the POP compound mixture.<ref name=\"Walker, C.H. 2001\"/>\n\n== In urban areas and indoor environments ==\nTraditionally it was thought that human exposure to POPs occurred primarily through [[food]], however [[Indoor air quality|indoor pollution]] patterns that characterize certain POPs have challenged this notion. Recent studies of indoor [[dust]] and [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] have implicated indoor environments as a major sources for human exposure via inhalation and ingestion.<ref>Walker, C.H., \"Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective\" (2001)</ref> Furthermore, significant indoor POP pollution must be a major route of human POP exposure, considering the modern trend in spending larger proportions of life indoor. Several studies have shown that indoor (air and dust) POP levels to exceed outdoor (air and soil) POP concentrations.<ref name=\"Harrad, S. 2010\"/>\n\n== Control and removal in the environment ==\nCurrent studies aimed at minimizing POPs in the environment are investigating their behavior in [[photocatalysis|photo catalytic oxidation reactions]].  POPs that are found in humans and in [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] the most are the main subjects of these experiments. [[aromatic compound|Aromatic]] and [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] degradation products have been identified in these reactions. [[photocatalysis|Photochemical degradation]] is negligible compared to photocatalytic degradation.<ref>El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010).

It occurs when an absorbable solute comes into contact with a solid with a porous surface structure.
