It was directed by [[Friz Freleng]] and written by [[Michael Maltese]] and [[Tedd Pierce]]. All voices are performed by [[Mel Blanc]]. ''Along Came Daffy'' is one of only two Warner Bros. shorts (the other being ''[[Honey's Money]]'') in which Yosemite Sam is not paired with  [[Bugs Bunny]] (although at one point Daffy does ask, \"What's cookin', Doc?\", a variant of Bugs's \"What's up, Doc?\" catchphrase along with the famous \"eh\" and the imitated 'carrot chewing').\n\n==Plot==\nYosemite Sam and his black-haired twin are starving in a snowbound cabin. In a scene reminiscent of 1943's ''[[Wackiki Wabbit]]'', the two hungry men start to hallucinate and see each other as food due to extreme starvation.\n\nDaffy Duck turns up as a door-to-door salesman. Upon realizing he is a duck, the two Sams chase Daffy all over the cabin, to try to turn him into a duck dinner. Eventually Daffy is able to explain that he is selling cookbooks, and happens to have a complimentary turkey dinner with all the trimmings  in his sample case. He lays out the spread and makes a quick exit as the famished Sams sit down to eat.\n\nBefore the two Sams can take a bite, a hoard of hungry mice dash from out of the woodwork and strip the turkey clean in a few seconds. At the point of despair, they hear another knock on the door. Daffy is there again, offering some after-dinner mints. The two Sams grab him and pull him inside. Daffy is able to stick his head out the door for a moment and tell the audience, \"Well, here we go again!\" He then gets yanked back inside and the door closes to a black-out that ends the cartoon.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Daffy Duck cartoons]]\n*[[List of Yosemite Sam cartoons]]\n*[[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Friz Freleng |state=collapsed}}\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n\n[[Category:1947 animated films]]\n[[Category:1947 films]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes shorts]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros.
