He expresses the hope that Deutscher's love of melody might help opera reconnect with the wider public and inject new life into the world of opera, which is so often pronounced dead nowadays. However, he also expresses the fear that (what he terms) 'advanced culture-theorists' would regard Deutscher's love of melody as a threat, and accuse it of 'anachronism', 'cultural populism'.\n\nIn February 2017, Deutscher made a public statement about her style, her love of melody, and her musical aesthetics, in a message to a press conference of the Carinthian Summer Music Festival in Austria. She explained that some people have told her that she should not compose beautiful melodies in the twenty-first century, because music must reflect the complexity and ugliness of the modern world. \"But I think that these people just got a little bit confused.

But I have often been told: \"as a modern composer, you\u2019ll soon have to forget your melodies, and concentrate on dissonance, as befits our modern age.\" But maybe this award today means that a more tolerant age is dawning, when melody and beauty will once again be permitted. Perhaps this is a message that there is more to European Culture than just dissonance. Perhaps there is also a place in European Culture for harmony. And how beautiful it would be if this message could go out into the world from Vienna, from the city of music.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=Alma's plea for harmony at the European Culture Prize ceremony 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPGkN-Ravig|language=en|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>  </blockquote>In April 2018, Austrian critic {{Interlanguage link|Wilhelm Sinkovicz|de}} added his voice to the discussion, after he heard Deutscher performing her own piano concerto in Vienna.<ref name=\"Sinkowicz\">[https://www.pressreader.com/austria/die-presse/20180424/281908773748021 \"Die zauberischen T\u00f6ne reicher Jungm\u00e4dchenfantasien\"].

He concluded that it is a misconception to believe that the language of music must constantly move 'forward' or that composers need to invent the wheel each time anew. \"The world turns in a circle\", he wrote, \"but always sprouts new, beautiful flowers, if one only lets them sprout.\"\n\nDeutscher herself has often stressed her strong affinity to the musical language of the Viennese Classics.

In the first act, Cinderella chances upon a captivating love poem, which unbeknownst to her, was written by the prince. She is inspired by the poem and sets it to her own music. Her melody is then stolen by her step-sisters and sung at a singing competition during the ball, but with the wrong words. Finally, Cinderella herself sings her melody to the prince, unaware that he wrote the words of the poem. After Cinderella flees from the ball at midnight, the prince searches for Cinderella, not using a glass slipper as in the traditional fairy tale, but using a melody. Eventually, the pair are united: \"they find each other like lyrics find melody\".<ref name=\"Zeit\" /> \nDeutscher explained that her Cinderella \"is not just a pretty girl who cleans the floor and keeps quiet, she\u2019s clever and talented\", and she wins the prince not through the size of her foot, but because of her talent as a composer.<ref name=\"Financial Times\"/>\n\nDeutscher started working on the opera at age 8.

He expresses the hope that Deutscher's love of melody might help opera reconnect with the wider public and inject new life into the world of opera, which is so often pronounced dead nowadays. However, he also expresses the fear that (what he terms) 'advanced culture-theorists' would regard Deutscher's love of melody as a threat, and accuse it of 'anachronism', 'cultural populism'.\n\nIn February 2017, Deutscher made a public statement about her style, her love of melody, and her musical aesthetics, in a message to a press conference of the Carinthian Summer Music Festival in Austria. She explained that some people have told her that she should not compose beautiful melodies in the twenty-first century, because music must reflect the complexity and ugliness of the modern world. \"But I think that these people just got a little bit confused.

But I have often been told: \"as a modern composer, you\u2019ll soon have to forget your melodies, and concentrate on dissonance, as befits our modern age.\" But maybe this award today means that a more tolerant age is dawning, when melody and beauty will once again be permitted. Perhaps this is a message that there is more to European Culture than just dissonance. Perhaps there is also a place in European Culture for harmony. And how beautiful it would be if this message could go out into the world from Vienna, from the city of music.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=Alma's plea for harmony at the European Culture Prize ceremony 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPGkN-Ravig|language=en|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>  </blockquote>In April 2018, Austrian critic {{Interlanguage link|Wilhelm Sinkovicz|de}} added his voice to the discussion, after he heard Deutscher performing her own piano concerto in Vienna.<ref name=\"Sinkowicz\">[https://www.pressreader.com/austria/die-presse/20180424/281908773748021 \"Die zauberischen T\u00f6ne reicher Jungm\u00e4dchenfantasien\"].

He concluded that it is a misconception to believe that the language of music must constantly move 'forward' or that composers need to invent the wheel each time anew. \"The world turns in a circle\", he wrote, \"but always sprouts new, beautiful flowers, if one only lets them sprout.\"\n\nDeutscher herself has often stressed her strong affinity to the musical language of the Viennese Classics.

He was a member of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]], and represented the [[Kalahandi (Lok Sabha constituency)|Kalahandi constituency]] in the [[15th Lok Sabha]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Profile of Members| work = Government of India| url = http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Members/Biography.aspx?mpsno=4426| accessdate = 12 March 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101010523/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Members/Biography.aspx?mpsno=4426| archive-date = 1 January 2012| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nDas graduated from the [[Sambalpur University]] and, with a background in Law, worked as an advocate before joining politics.\n\nThe contribution of Bhakta Charan Das-an activist cum politician for ensuring the basic right and entitlements and conservation of nature is a milestone and a source of inspiration for others.=\nIn 1977 he came in contact with YUVA CHATTRA SANGHARSH BAHINI (the student wing of JP movement in 1977). Under the banner of this organization he started revolution against the rampant corruption at different levels and worked for the basic entitlements of the marginal section. Under his leadership the organisation pressed demand to provide employment to the local youths of the nearby districts in Indravati Hydro & Irrigation Project and he was successful to a greater extent.\n\n==Save Forest Movement \u2013 1982-83==\nMr. Das carried on the movement \"SAVE FOREST\" in a peaceful & non-violent way. He made the people aware of the adverse effects of cutting down the forest. He made the people aware of the ecological imbalance \u2013 the consequences being warming of the climate and reduction in rainfall. Subsequently, it would ruin the agriculture & food security of thousands of people in the area. He appealed the forest dwellers i.e. the primitive tribes to protect the forest & wild animals from the clutches of illegal timber contractors & corrupt forest officials. He threatened the District Forest Administration against government's faulty policy of auctioning of the timber trees. Though govt. went for auction of timber & bamboo, the contractors were not allowed to enter into the forest by the forest dwellers & nearby villagers. In a few months it became a mass movement & forests could be protected to a greater extent.\n\n==Farmers' Movement - 1983==\nIn 1983 he took up the farmers\u2019 cause. He started farmers\u2019 agitation in the district pressing people's demands to waive all the bank loans of the marginal farmers who were affected due to drought in Kalahandi & other districts. Shri Kishan Pattnaik, a veteran socialist leader (Nehrujee called him Mini Lohia) & then Member of Parliament from [[Sambalpur]] Constituency was all along with him in the movement. He organized peaceful protests in front of the office of Collector in the district headquarter & B.D.O.s at Block headquarters in the entire district. Several farmers\u2019 rallies were organized in the nook & corner of the district. Thousands of farmers joined the movement & in a few months it became a mass movement. The govt in the state was pressurized & some of the demands of the farmers were fulfilled.\n\n==As a politician==\nAs an MLA he was moving extensively in the entire district. There were many inaccessible areas which were never visited by any elected representatives or officials of the district administration or local administration since independence. With all hardships he visited all of them and also involved the officials of the district administration to visit those areas. It was a long battle. He fought it day and night. He adopted various methods to draw the attention of the press, media, administration & the government at large. He and his activists conducted so many peaceful protests, bandhs, road blockades, hunger strikes etc. which were highlighted in all the leading magazines and newspapers of the country. He made every effort to highlight the precarious condition of suffering millions of his district on the floor of [[Odisha]] Legislative Assembly. Kalahandi issue dominated [[Odisha]] Assembly most of the times. For all these endeavors, ultimately Kalahandi drew the attention of the entire nation.\n\n==As a member of Parliament and Minister in Govt. of India-==\nMr. Das was at a young age of 30  was given ticket by Janta Party to fight the [[Lok Sabha]] Election, 1989 from Kalahandi Lok Sabha Constituency. Again this time too people made him victorious by a huge margin. \nHe became Deputy Minister, Sports & Youth Affairs in the Union Ministry headed by Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister Shri V.P.Singh. Though the tenure was very short (only for a period of five months) his performance was excellent & visible. \nV.P. Singh Government fell. The new government was formed headed by Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister Chandra Shekharjee. Mr. Bhakta Charan got a berth in the union ministry. He was sworn in as Minister of State for Railways. Though it too was a short tenure, his performance was remarkable & praise worthy. Several new lines were surveyed, approved by the Planning Commission & included in the Union Railway Budget for sanction & allocation of funds. Provisions were made for many new trains to run on new routes, railway stations were modernized with introduction of new technologies & enhanced amenities. \nHe raises issue of the tribal, farmer and other marginal sections from time to time. Due to his effort the farmers of [[Odisha]] got the benefit of more than Rs 500 crore from National crop insurance Scheme in the year 2012\u201313. His effort has ensured several road, irrigation and railway projects in [[Kalahandi district|Kalahandi]] and Nuapada districts in between 2009\u20132014,\n\n==Conservation of Niyamgiri and protection of right of the Primitive tribal groups \u2013==\nIn 2003 Vedanta signed a MoU with govt. of [[Odisha]] for Alumina refinery at Lanjigarh and Bauxite mining from Niyamagiri. He played a key role to protect the NIYAMAGIRI and the right of the local inhabitants particularly Dongaria Kondhs whose life cannot run without the NIYAMAGIRI is god for them and source of food, fodder and all living materials. \nHe supported the battle in favour of the local community instead of Vedanta in this era of Neo liberal economy where politicians are patronizing investment and mining projects.\nAfter a long struggle by different civil society groups and local community Mr. Das appraised the details to [[Sonia Gandhi|Smt. Sonia Gandhi]], President, AICC & Hon\u2019ble Chair-person, UPA time to time. Smt. Gandhi assured her full cooperation to the tribal cause. Subsequently, Sh. Rahul Gandhi, M.P. & Hon\u2019ble Gen Secretary, AICC visited Niyamgiri Hills in spite of all denials by SPG & local administration showing security threats. He reached the tribal in the remote villages, talked to them and had a close view of the earth's bounty & the domain of PTGs, their pristine forests & mountains. He heard the real stories of innocent tribal's torture by Vedanta. He was spell bound by the tribal innocence. He could realize the ground realities and assured the tribal that he is also a Sipahi at Delhi, one among them in their battle. There was a sudden twist & the movement was geared up. \nHowever Mr. Das & his activists carried on the movement in a peaceful & non-violent way \u2013 on the foot steps of Gandhian ideology. He managed to high light the illegal activities of Vedanta at government of [[India]] level.\n\n==Implementation of forest right act-2006 ==\nHe supported Jamguda village of [[Kalahandi district|kalahandi]] district to ensure the right to sell bamboo from the natural forest( first village in [[Odisha]] and second in [[India]]) within the framework of FRA-2006. He has tried to put pressure on govt of [[Odisha]] through press meets for proper implantation of the act. His effort paved the way for 100 crore bamboo business to forest dwellers in [[Odisha]]. Due to his effort two central ministers Jayaram Ramesh And V kishore Chandra Deo along with the revenue minister of govt of [[Odisha]] Surya narayan Patra visited Jamguda village and ensured sell of Bamboo by Jamguda GramSabha on 4 March -2013.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kalahandi (Lok Sabha constituency)]]\n* [[Indian general election in Orissa, 2009]]\n* [[Indian National Congress]]\n* [[Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{15th LS members from Odisha}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Das, Bhakta Charan}}\n[[Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Odisha]]\n[[Category:15th Lok Sabha members]]\n[[Category:1958 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:9th Lok Sabha members]]\n[[Category:11th Lok Sabha members]]\n[[Category:Lok Sabha members from Odisha]]\n[[Category:People from Kalahandi district]]\n[[Category:Janata Dal politicians]]\n[[Category:Samajwadi Janata Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Sambalpur University Alumni]]\n[[Category:Samta Party politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian politician|bot=PearBOT 5}}\n{{BLP sources|date=March 2013}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2015}}\n{{Infobox Indian politician\n| name =  Bhakta Charan Das\n| image =\n| caption = \n| birth_date =  {{Birth date and age|1958|11|26|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Kalahandi]], [[Odisha]]\n| residence = \n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| birth_name  = \n| office =[[Member of Parliament|MP]],  [[9th Lok Sabha|9th]], [[11th Lok Sabha|11th]] and [[15th Lok Sabha]],\n| constituency = [[Kalahandi (Lok Sabha constituency)|Kalahandi]]\n| term_start = 2009\n| term_end =  2014\n| predecessor = [[Bikram Keshari Deo]]\n| successor =  [[Arka Keshari Deo]]\n| constituency1 = \n|order1             =  Spokesperson and Secretary\n| office1            =  All India Congress Committee\n| order2             =  Minister of State\n| office2            =  Ministry of Railways (India)\n| term_start2 = 1990\n| term_end2 = 1991\n| order3             =  Deputy Minister\n| office3            =  Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports (India)\n| term_start3 = 1989\n| term_end3 = 1990\n| predecessor2 = \n| successor2 = \n| party = [[Indian National Congress]]\n| otherparty  = [[Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya)]] <small>(1989\u20131996)</small>\n| alma_mater  = [[Sambalpur University]]\n| profession  = [[Social Worker]], [[Advocate]], [[Journalist]]\n| religion  = [[Hindu]]\n| spouse = Smt.
