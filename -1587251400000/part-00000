This was a turning point for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.\n\nOf the original two Royal Grammar Schools, in 1846 one closed and the other merged with the [[High School of Montreal]]. By the mid-19th century the RIAL had lost control of the other eighty-two [[grammar schools]] it had administered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/resources/guide/vol2_3/gen03.htm |title=Education |work=[[McGill University Archives]]|accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> However, in 1853 it took over the High School of Montreal from the school's board of directors and continued to operate it until 1870.<ref>[http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/resources/guide/vol2_3/gen03.htm Guide to the Archives, vol. 2] at archives.mcgill.ca, accessed 28 December 2017</ref><ref>James Collins Miller, ''National Government and Education in Federated Democracies, Dominion of Canada'' (1940), p. 44</ref> Thereafter, its sole remaining purpose was to administer the McGill bequest on behalf of the private college. The RIAL continues to exist today; it is the [[corporate identity]] that runs the university and its various constituent bodies, including the former Macdonald College (now Macdonald Campus), the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]], and the Royal Victoria College (the former women's college turned residence).

The first single, \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\", went to No. 1 in the US and Canada, and was a top ten hit in numerous other territories. The album has sold over 2.5 million copies. It was the group's fourteenth album (twelfth internationally). The album was re-issued by [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] and [[Rhino Records]]. This was the first record featuring the [[Gibb-Galuten-Richardson]] production team which would have many successful collaborations in the following years.\n\n==Background==\nBecause their manager [[Robert Stigwood]] had ended his US distribution arrangement with [[Atlantic Records]], Atlantic producer [[Arif Mardin]], who had produced the Bee Gees' prior two albums, was no longer permitted to work with the group. In an effort to retain the same sound, the group recorded at the same studios ([[Criteria Studios]] in Miami). At first, they recruited producer [[Richard Perry]], but they parted company after only a couple of weeks over the musical direction the group should take. At this point the Bee Gees decided to produce the album themselves, with [[Barry Gibb]] taking the lead role, along with engineer Karl Richardson. They added young musician and arranger [[Albhy Galuten]] to the control room as musical adviser. The new team saw the group through a series of top selling recordings over the next four years.\n\n==Recording==\nThe album was recorded from 19 January to 30 March, when they recorded \"You Should Be Dancing\", \"[[Love So Right]]\", \"Subway\", \"[[Love Me (Bee Gees song)|Love Me]]\", \"You Stepped Into My Life\", \"The Way It Was\", \"Walk Before You Run\" (unreleased), \"The Feel\" (unreleased) and \"Lovers\" which had Robin singing lead in falsetto. All the songs were finished in [[Quebec]], except the two unreleased songs and \"Walk Before You Run\" which was written by Barry Gibb with [[Stephen Stills]].<ref name=\"good\"/> During a break recording ''Children of the World'' , [[Robin Gibb|Robin]] and [[Maurice Gibb]] returned in England to spend time with their families, while Barry stayed in Miami to mix the new single and to record \"The Way It Was\".<ref name=\"blues\"/> From 2 April to 26 May, the group recorded songs in [[Le Studio]], Quebec. \"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\" (recorded 2 May) was not included on the album but it was used as the B-side of \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" in 1978.<ref name=\"good\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/76.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1976 |author=Joseph Brennan}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe  album was released in September 1976. Four singles were released.  \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" in June 1976 (UK) / July 1976 (US); \"[[Love So Right]]\" in September 1976; \"[[Boogie Child]]\" in January 1977; and \"Children of the World\" in February 1977.  \"You Should Be Dancing\"  went to No. 1 in the US. \"Love So Right\" and \"Boogie Child\" reached No. 3 and No. 12 respectively in the US. \"Love Me\" was a hit for [[Yvonne Elliman]] and \"You Stepped into My Life\" was recorded by Wayne Newton in 1979. Barry Gibb felt that other tracks could also be hits.<ref name=\"blues\">{{cite

The first single, \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\", went to No. 1 in the US and Canada, and was a top ten hit in numerous other territories. The album has sold over 2.5 million copies. It was the group's fourteenth album (twelfth internationally). The album was re-issued by [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] and [[Rhino Records]]. This was the first record featuring the [[Gibb-Galuten-Richardson]] production team which would have many successful collaborations in the following years.\n\n==Background==\nBecause their manager [[Robert Stigwood]] had ended his US distribution arrangement with [[Atlantic Records]], Atlantic producer [[Arif Mardin]], who had produced the Bee Gees' prior two albums, was no longer permitted to work with the group. In an effort to retain the same sound, the group recorded at the same studios ([[Criteria Studios]] in Miami). At first, they recruited producer [[Richard Perry]], but they parted company after only a couple of weeks over the musical direction the group should take. At this point the Bee Gees decided to produce the album themselves, with [[Barry Gibb]] taking the lead role, along with engineer Karl Richardson. They added young musician and arranger [[Albhy Galuten]] to the control room as musical adviser. The new team saw the group through a series of top selling recordings over the next four years.\n\n==Recording==\nThe album was recorded from 19 January to 30 March, when they recorded \"You Should Be Dancing\", \"[[Love So Right]]\", \"Subway\", \"[[Love Me (Bee Gees song)|Love Me]]\", \"You Stepped Into My Life\", \"The Way It Was\", \"Walk Before You Run\" (unreleased), \"The Feel\" (unreleased) and \"Lovers\" which had Robin singing lead in falsetto. All the songs were finished in [[Quebec]], except the two unreleased songs and \"Walk Before You Run\" which was written by Barry Gibb with [[Stephen Stills]].<ref name=\"good\"/> During a break recording ''Children of the World'' , [[Robin Gibb|Robin]] and [[Maurice Gibb]] returned in England to spend time with their families, while Barry stayed in Miami to mix the new single and to record \"The Way It Was\".<ref name=\"blues\"/> From 2 April to 26 May, the group recorded songs in [[Le Studio]], Quebec. \"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\" (recorded 2 May) was not included on the album but it was used as the B-side of \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" in 1978.<ref name=\"good\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/76.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1976 |author=Joseph Brennan}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe  album was released in September 1976. Four singles were released.  \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" in June 1976 (UK) / July 1976 (US); \"[[Love So Right]]\" in September 1976; \"[[Boogie Child]]\" in January 1977; and \"Children of the World\" in February 1977.  \"You Should Be Dancing\"  went to No. 1 in the US. \"Love So Right\" and \"Boogie Child\" reached No. 3 and No. 12 respectively in the US. \"Love Me\" was a hit for [[Yvonne Elliman]] and \"You Stepped into My Life\" was recorded by Wayne Newton in 1979. Barry Gibb felt that other tracks could also be hits.<ref name=\"blues\">{{cite
