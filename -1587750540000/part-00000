His upbringing was solidly religious, not exactly privileged but not quite plebeian either. His family owned a mosque and a madrassa, in Omdurman. His maternal grandfather, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sawi Abdul-Maged, belonged to the Khatemiya Sufi Order and enjoyed close connections with the traditional leaders of the sect \u2014 the Al-Mirghani family, while his paternal grandfather Sheikh Mohamed Abdul- Maged was a follower of the rival Al-Shadhiliya Sufi Order. They were blood brothers.\n\nOne of his uncles, named after Abdul-Aziz Al- Dabbagh of Al-Ibriz fame, was a religious scholar in his own right. Like his more famous namesake, Khalid\u2019s uncle was a devout Sufi and poet, whose life is documented in one of Khalid\u2019s books. A friend and close associate of Sheikh Mustafa Al- Maraghi, who served as Grand Qadi of Sudan, Khalid\u2019s uncle championed a third Sufi sect, the Tijaniya Sufi Order. Khalid\u2019s uncle Abdul-Aziz Al-Dabbagh had a very wide network of relationships in countries as far afield as Egypt and Albania, Arabia and Morocco, where the head of the Tijaniya was based. And it was in honour of these devout forefathers that Khalid wrote the Al- Magediya Trilogy, a study in the three men's respective philosophies and poetry, which tackles such ethereal Sufi subjects as \"divine inspiration\", \"ecstatic expressions\" and \"sacred diffusion\".\n\nAfter first toying with fine arts, Khalid switched to law. Ironically, an Egyptian professor of his, who was soon to become Ambassador Mohamed Abdel-Aziz Ishaq, sparked Khalid's first interest in black Africa. Notwithstanding its location in the heart of the African continent, Sudan was insular and the northern Sudanese perceptions of black Africa at the time was somewhat distorted, rather vague and clouded by the poetry of Al- Mutanabbi, the tales of Al-Massaudi, and the travels of Ibn Battuta.\n\nIt was during his student days that he developed an interest in journalism. He worked as a freelancer for a number of Sudanese papers including Garidat Al-Nil, which belonged to the Ansar Al- Mahdi sect, whose editor was Abdul-Rahim Al- Amin, one of Khalid's university lecturers. Another, Al-Mustaqbal (The Future) was owned by Al-Sharif Al-Hindi. Khalid soon became the Khartoum correspondent of Agence France Presse AFP, and took up the study of French at the French Cultural Centre in Khartoum. There he met Jacques Berg who was later to prove instrumental in arranging for Khalid to achieve a scholarship to study French in France.\n\nFrance opened up new horizons. He discovered a whole new dimension of African culture working closely with the Paris-based magazine Pr\u00e9sence Africaine. His circle of friends widened constantly and considerably.\n\nIn Paris, Khalid met [[Hassan Al-Turabi]] who was working on a PhD in Constitutional Law. \"We were very close friends,\" Khalid confesses. \"Even after I left Paris for Algeria we used to correspond regularly. In one of those letters I told him that I was a secularist. He replied that he had chosen \u2019the right path\u2019.\"\n\nKhalid\u2019s political ideas were evidently formed early in his career, and changed little thereafter. He persistently declined to be drawn into any ideological school of thought and sees himself essentially as a principled pragmatist. His academic and political careers reinforced his reasoning and convictions.\n\nAfter graduation in 1956, Khalid went straight into legal practice but after a couple of years, he successfully applied for a scholarship to study economic theory at the prestigious Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Among his colleagues at the time were Nabil Shaath, currently the Palestinian Authority\u2019s minister of international co-operation.\n\nOne of his professors at Wharton used to be adviser to the United Nations, and recommended him for a job at the UN as officer in the legal department. Those were tumultuous times. The Congo crisis was in full swing and was soon to claim the life of the UN\u2019s Swedish secretary-general, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. Khalid was the first and only African to join the UN\u2019s legal department in those days, quite naturally he was given the task of doing legal work on Congo.\n\nBut Khalid was not as thorough as he should have been in scrutinising every word and detail. He prepared a report to be used as background information for a speech to be presented by U Thant, the late Burmese UN secretary-general who succeeded Hammarskj\u00f6ld. U Thant soon discovered the discrepancies in Khalid\u2019s report. \"I take credit for the good work you do, but I also take the blame for your mistakes. You make mistakes, but my mistakes are blunders,\" a furious U Thant admonished.\n\nNewly independent Algeria gave Khalid the opportunity to polish his rusty French. Algeria was then at the epicentre of the African liberation movement. He left the country shortly after the late Algerian President Houari Boummedienne ousted President Ahmed Ben Bella. \"I was privileged to make close and lasting friendships in Algiers. Those were some of the most rewarding years of my life. My time in Algeria was very special.\" Khalid struck immediate friendships with then Foreign Minister [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], and such veteran Algerian diplomats as Mohamed Sahnoun and [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], currently the UN secretary- general's special envoy to Afghanistan.\n\nAfter Algeria, Khalid returned to Paris to work on his doctoral thesis. Paris was at the time a meeting place for Arab intellectuals, and Khalid wasted no time making new friends and consolidating old friendships. Among those he became especially close to was the late Lutfi El- Kholi, former Arab League secretary-general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, and Ahmed Bahaaeddin. \"Paris was intellectually enriching.\" He was also seconded to UNESCO while working on his doctoral thesis. Having obtained a PhD, Khalid left France, crossed the Atlantic for the United States and accepted a job at the University of Colorado, where he taught a course in the law of international institutions.\n\nThe 1967 Arab-Israeli War took place while Khalid was in Boulder, Colorado. In the US, Khalid experienced the influence of Zionism first hand. \"The entire experience was an eye-opener,\" he says. \"A few weeks before the Six Day War erupted, one of my colleagues quietly asked me to relieve one of my students from sitting the exams. I was curious and asked the girl if she was ill or unwell. She said that she was fine, but that she would like to go to Israel. \u2019Why do you want to go to Israel?\u2019 I asked her, my curiosity heightened. \u2019I\u2019m going to replace someone who\u2019s going to the front,\u2019 she said. \u2019Replace him as what,\u2019 I pressed. It transpired that she was replacing a teacher who taught in a school for North African immigrants in Israel.\"\n\nEven though Khalid\u2019s student was American, she was fluent in French, the language of instruction for the North African immigrants. It was then that Khalid realised how organised the Israelis were and how efficient their networks were. At the height of their war preparations, they were not only thinking seriously about their school system and how to re-organise it during the war period, but more importantly making the necessary preparations utilising an international network of dedicated people. Khalid\u2019s realisation didn\u2019t soften the blow of defeat when it came, but went some way to explain the depth of the defeat. \"It was time for me to re-think some of the givens,\" he explains.\n\nAfter a year in Colorado, which broadened his horizons, Khalid returned to Paris and UNESCO. It was there that he first met and later developed a lasting friendship with Dr Mustafa Kamal Tolba, at the time Egypt's minister of scientific research, who was also a member of the UNESCO board. Khalid was to meet him time and again in Paris, Nairobi, New York and indeed Cairo.\n\nA politician of firm convictions and a liberal, Khalid distanced himself from Sudanese politicians who used religious bigotry as a political weapon. He became an outspoken critic of his old friend Hassan Al-Turabi who had returned to Sudan to head the Islamic Charter Front. They had long since parted ways and their paths had diverged considerably. In Paris, he had written a series of provocative articles in Al-Ayyam, the Sudanese daily, in which he unleashed a torrent of scathing criticism on the vicious anti-communist campaign spearheaded by [[Sadig Al-Mahdi]] and Al-Turabi, who had at the time joined hands to promulgate an Islamic Constitution. The two politico-religious leaders and their supporters had declared open war on secularism and apostasy, a thinly-veiled euphemism for communism. \"Any undesirable individual or political opponent can be dismissed and badgered if branded an apostate,\" Khalid argued.\n\nWith the blessing of the then Prime Minister [[Sadig Al-Mahdi]], the [[Parliament of Sudan]] voted to make it possible for an apostate MP to be unceremoniously thrown out of parliament. They amended the Constitution and introduced a clause to that effect. The Supreme Court promptly ruled that Parliament's decision was unconstitutional. The Sudanese government refused to abide by that ruling. \"In one stroke it abrogated two pillars of democracy: the independence of the judiciary and circumventing the will of the people.\"\n\nIt was in this context that Khalid accepted the offer to join the government of [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] which toppled the elected government of Sadig Al-Mahdi in May 1969. \"It was a decision that I lived to regret,\" Khalid muses. He was offered the post of adviser to the Revolutionary Command Council. Khalid, however, opted for the cabinet position of minister of youth and social affairs. Fired with enthusiasm after the Paris student riots of 1968, Khalid was brimming with new ideas. He had first-hand experience of the Paris riots and was obsessed with the concept of the \"crisis of generations\". UNESCO itself was embroiled in working out solutions to the problem and he saw his new post as a golden opportunity to put his ideas into practice. Khalid adopted a \"functional approach\". He closely collaborated with his Egyptian counterpart Safieddin Abul-Ezz. It was at this time that he had an \"interesting and memorable\" meeting with the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel-Nasser in Ma\u2019amoura, Alexandria. Hassan Sabri Al-Kholi was in attendance. Nasser asked Khalid what the problems facing Sudan's youth were. \"The communists want to control the regime and the Muslim Brothers want to overthrow it,\" Khalid replied. Nasser nodded in agreement. \"We suffer from this very problem over here,\" he said in sympathy with Khalid.\n\nKhalid met Nasser as a cabinet minister of former Sudanese President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]]'s government. He was to hold other more senior posts in Nimeiry's successive governments. But Khalid fell out with Nimeiry when the latter instituted the now-infamous September Laws which prompted the April 1985 popular uprisings that eventually led to Nimeiry's fall. Nimeiry claimed to institute Shari\u2019a Law, but Sudan is a multi-religious and multi-cultural country, Khalid explains. With the coming to power of the NIF, a jihad was declared obligatory on all Muslim males. \"Thus while Muslims who did not subscribe to the NIF vision of Islam became second class citizens in their own country, non-Muslim southern Sudanese were reduced to an engendered sub-species. Needless to say, the NIF philosophy does not sit well with the southern Sudanese.\n\n\"Following the NIF\u2019s military coup, Mohamed Osman Al-Mirghani (Democratic Unionist Party leader), and Mohamed Ibrahim Nugud (secretary-general of the Sudanese Communist Party), found themselves together in Bashir\u2019s jail. Days later they were joined by Sadig Al-Mahdi, the ousted premier and Umma Party leader). Walled in with them was an improbable inmate, Hassan Al-Turabi, leader of the NIF. As it turned out later, the new regime sought to conceal the identity of the coup by locking in the NIF leader. Also, they might have thought that during his confinement, Al-Turabi would be able to win over the two religious leaders,\" Khalid explains. They were to be sorely disappointed. \"Rather than falling prey to NIF wiles, the two religious leaders, Mahdi and Al- Mirghani, together with their leftist partner, Nugud, drew a draft charter of what was to become the gospel of the umbrella opposition grouping, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\" In an ironic twist of fate, even Al- Turabi, who is now under house arrest in Khartoum after his Popular Congress Party signed a memorandum of understanding with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), has signalled his readiness to sign the Asmara Resolution of 1995.\n\nHe died on 22 April 2020 at the age of 88.<ref>[https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/sudan-south-sudan-mourn-death-of-mansour-khalid Sudan, South Sudan mourn death of Mansour Khalid]L</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khalid, Mansour}}\n[[Category:1931 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Foreign ministers of Sudan]]\n[[Category:Sudanese politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sudanese politician}}\n{{copypaste|date=May 2016}}\n'''Mansour Khalid''' (\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0644\u062f) (13 December 1931 in [[Omdurman]], [[Sudan]] \u2013 22 April 2020)<ref>https://www.rulers.org/indexk2.html</ref> was a Sudanese politician who served as [[Foreign Minister of Sudan]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Speeches Delivered by Dr. Mansour Khalid, Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the General Assembly of the U.N. and Security Council, Oct. 1973 Speeches Delivered by Dr. Mansour Khalid, Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the General Assembly of the U.N. and Security Council, Oct. 1973 |year=1973 |publisher=Ministry of Culture and Information |location=Khartoum |oclc=45719255 }}</ref> was first vice chairman of [[Brundtland Commission]] which is formally known as the World Commission on Environment and Development.<ref>{{cite book |title=Environmental NGOs in World Politics |authorlink=Matthias Finger |last=Finger |first=Matthias |page=187 |year=1994 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415115094 }}</ref> The Chairman of the Commission was [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], (former Prime Minister of [[Norway]]).\n\nKhalid held several important ministerial posts, and maintained close working relationships with several African leaders. \n\nKhalid was born in Omdurman, Sudan\u2019s spiritual and cultural capital.

He closely collaborated with his Egyptian counterpart Safieddin Abul-Ezz. It was at this time that he had an \"interesting and memorable\" meeting with the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel-Nasser in Ma\u2019amoura, Alexandria. Hassan Sabri Al-Kholi was in attendance. Nasser asked Khalid what the problems facing Sudan's youth were. \"The communists want to control the regime and the Muslim Brothers want to overthrow it,\" Khalid replied. Nasser nodded in agreement. \"We suffer from this very problem over here,\" he said in sympathy with Khalid.\n\nKhalid met Nasser as a cabinet minister of former Sudanese President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]]'s government. He was to hold other more senior posts in Nimeiry's successive governments. But Khalid fell out with Nimeiry when the latter instituted the now-infamous September Laws which prompted the April 1985 popular uprisings that eventually led to Nimeiry's fall. Nimeiry claimed to institute Shari\u2019a Law, but Sudan is a multi-religious and multi-cultural country, Khalid explains. With the coming to power of the NIF, a jihad was declared obligatory on all Muslim males. \"Thus while Muslims who did not subscribe to the NIF vision of Islam became second class citizens in their own country, non-Muslim southern Sudanese were reduced to an engendered sub-species. Needless to say, the NIF philosophy does not sit well with the southern Sudanese.\n\n\"Following the NIF\u2019s military coup, Mohamed Osman Al-Mirghani (Democratic Unionist Party leader), and Mohamed Ibrahim Nugud (secretary-general of the Sudanese Communist Party), found themselves together in Bashir\u2019s jail. Days later they were joined by Sadig Al-Mahdi, the ousted premier and Umma Party leader). Walled in with them was an improbable inmate, Hassan Al-Turabi, leader of the NIF. As it turned out later, the new regime sought to conceal the identity of the coup by locking in the NIF leader. Also, they might have thought that during his confinement, Al-Turabi would be able to win over the two religious leaders,\" Khalid explains. They were to be sorely disappointed. \"Rather than falling prey to NIF wiles, the two religious leaders, Mahdi and Al- Mirghani, together with their leftist partner, Nugud, drew a draft charter of what was to become the gospel of the umbrella opposition grouping, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\" In an ironic twist of fate, even Al- Turabi, who is now under house arrest in Khartoum after his Popular Congress Party signed a memorandum of understanding with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), has signalled his readiness to sign the Asmara Resolution of 1995.\n\nHe died on 22 April 2020 at the age of 88.<ref>[https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/sudan-south-sudan-mourn-death-of-mansour-khalid Sudan, South Sudan mourn death of Mansour Khalid]L</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khalid, Mansour}}\n[[Category:1931 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Foreign ministers of Sudan]]\n[[Category:Sudanese politicians]]\n", "name_user": "Deb", "label": "safe", "comment": "bring intro into line with bio standards", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansour_Khalid"}

Mark does not to tell his wife, deciding to use the time to return to [[Santo Domingo]], where 12 years ago he met Maira, the woman of his life. \n\nAt the island airport, Mark meets his old friend Jacques who has reserved a room for him at the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]]. Jacques tells Mark that Maira really loved him and would have followed him but was too poor to do so. When Maira disappeared, her father, an old voodoo magician, left his house to stay at [[Boca de Yuma]], a wild place at the other side of the island, together with his little daughter.\n\nWhile Mark is dreaming of his upcoming surgery in his room, a hotel maid masturbates, looking at his exposed penis. When he wakes up, he has sex with her. In a call home, he learns his wife is drunk. Later, walking the streets, he sees Maira's reflection in a shopping window, looking at him. She appears unchanged by time.\n\nAt Jacques', Mark meets Lucia, whom Jacques rescued from prostitution when she was 15. Lucia had the idea of founding a school, but they need funding. In Jacques' absence, Mark says he is nauseated by their kindness, talks about perhaps providing the funding himself, and asks Lucia to do as she did with 15. Disgusted, she performs oral sex on him \"for Jacques\". Later, Mark is in genital pain, and Jacques accompanies him to the hotel, where Mark injects himself with the painkiller. Jacques tells him to stay away from himself and Lucia.\n\nIn the streets, Mark spots Maira again. She addresses him, saying it was his return that makes her appearance possible. When Mark is forced to grope his groin in pain, she vanishes. At night, Mark meets his friend Voyakis, now owner of a successful nightclub. Mark tells him about once seeing a voodoo magician performing a strange rite after a car accident: He collected the soul in a bottle, and people said that if he opened it again, the soul would return again. Watching the gay dancer and his female partner dance to the music of \"Sexy Night\", Mark hallucinates her being Maira and experiences another fit of genital pain.\n\nThe next day, he goes to Boca di Yuma and meets Maira's father at the beach. He tells him that he collected her last breath in the bottle. She carried his name on her lips, cursing him. He also tells him he will never leave and that his illness will become stronger until he dies. She will not let him leave, and he will stay forever. When Mark asks him whether she is alive, he tells him she died long ago, but that for him she is alive until he too will live. In his glass bottle, he keeps her soul so that no evil spirit spirit can disturb her eternal sleep.\n\nWhen Mark's wife Liza arrives, he is asleep. She undresses, and wakes him up. She wants him to return with her for surgery. They talk about her sterility and his impending castration. When she mentions that she bought him with her money, Mark uncovers his erection and penetrates her from behind.\n\nLater, Mark receives a message from Maira and goes off to meet her on the beach where he remembers having sex with her back then. He meets her there and can feel the warmth of her skin, proving to himself it is not just a mad dream. He still desires her more than anything. She, however, is reproachful of his arrogant and destructive possessiveness and accuses him of having broken his promises and leaving her. She drugs him with a rare herb called \"Mexican mushroom\", then performs oral sex on an approaching black local while he is watching, immobilized by the drug. \n\nLiza, realising Mark has left her without even a message, books a flight back for the next day. At the airport, a man tells her that her husband will die if she leaves. In the meantime, Mark hides in a dark hotel room getting drunk and sees Maira and the overweight hotel owner having sex with two black men. Liza, after having looked for Mark in vain, visits Jacques, who locates him for her with a brief phone call. In return, he wants to get back what was taken from him, having sex with Liza while Lucia is watching, pleasuring herself. Mark, after injecting a high dose of painkiller, hallucinates about his surgery and about having sex with Lucia on the beach. He runs a temperature, and Maira comes to visit him in his room, wanting to take care of him, but leaving him again. In a fit of madness, Mark stabs the owner, accusing her of having defiled Maira. Jacques and Liza see Maira leaving the brothel and enter to find the body, and a man tells them that \"Maira\" is not the Maira of old, but her 10-year younger sister who the father has brought up magically in Maira's memory and physical likeness, to avenge her death, knowing that Mark would eventually come back.\n\nMark meets \"Maira\" on the beach. While they are having sex, she reveals that she is not who he thinks she is, and that he needs to die to avenge Maira's death. Mark walks away towards the sea, kneels down, and cuts off his own penis with a knife, his blood spurting and mixing with the foam. He dies. \"Maira\" sits down next to him and caresses him.\n\nWhen Jacques and Lisa find his body there, Jacques says, \"That was what Mark wanted.

Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]], struggling rapist, and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ \"Movie Reviews: Space Jam\".] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.</ref> the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.<ref name=\"JerryBeck\">{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}</ref> The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.\n\nIn 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nIn 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.

The rights to individual cartoons however are in other hands.\n\nIn 1955, Warner Bros. sold the television distribution rights to 191 of its cartoons (which included the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' and the black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made after Harman and Ising left) to Guild Films.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=2005-09-03|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ/page/n5 6]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> The copyrights to those cartoons were assigned to [[Sunset Productions]], an entity owned by Warner Bros.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/variety197-1955-02/page/n185/mode/2up|title=Guild Acquires 191 WB Cartoons|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1955-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLNkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176|title=Hollywood TV: The Studio System in the Fifties}}</ref> The cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and was bought by Seven Arts.

Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]] and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]].

The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J.

Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on March 17, 1978 at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and \"S-P-L-I-T\", a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody titled \"Cobumble\" is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears with Burnett in the comic sketch \"Hand Insurance\"; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured are new sketches of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\". In the \"Mrs. Wiggins\" sketch titled ''Flashbacks'', Mr. Tudball (Conway) is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to the first time he interviewed Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett); and in \"The Family\" sketch ''The Psychiatrist'', [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) and [[Thelma Harper|Mama]] (Lawrence) visit a psychiatrist ([[Craig Richard Nelson]]) as Eunice is trying to figure out what went wrong with her life. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\".

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on March 17, 1978 at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and \"S-P-L-I-T\", a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody titled \"Cobumble\" is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears with Burnett in the comic sketch \"Hand Insurance\"; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured are new sketches of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\". In the \"Mrs. Wiggins\" sketch titled ''Flashbacks'', Mr. Tudball (Conway) is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback of when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett); and in \"The Family\" sketch ''The Psychiatrist'', [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) and [[Thelma Harper|Mama]] (Lawrence) visit a psychiatrist ([[Craig Richard Nelson]]) as Eunice is trying to figure out what went wrong with her life. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre.

It is the first in the [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'' series]] not to be directed by Jackie, with [[Stanley Tong]] taking over the helm. It is also the last appearance in the series for [[Maggie Cheung]] as Jackie's girlfriend, May.<ref>{{cite news|title= Supercop Gets Kicks From Footloose Style |work=The Los Angeles Times|date=26 July 1996|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-26/entertainment/ca-27970_1_jackie-chan|accessdate=23 October 2010|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nKa-Kui is the \"supercop\" of the [[Hong Kong]] police, with amazing [[martial arts]] skills. He is sent to [[Guangzhou]], where the Chinese police force's Interpol director, Inspector Jessica Yang ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), briefs him on his next assignment. The target is Chaibat, a drug lord based in Hong Kong. To infiltrate Chaibat's organization, Ka-Kui is to get close to Chaibat's henchman Panther, who is in a Chinese prison. Ka-Kui, posing as a petty criminal prisoner, manages Panther's escape with the connivance of the guards. Grateful, Panther invites Ka-Kui to go with him to Hong Kong and join Chaibat's gang. Panther meets up with some of his other men, and vouches for Ka-Kui. The group heads for Hong Kong.\n\nOn the way, they pass through Ka-Kui's supposed home village, and Panther insists that Ka-Kui visit his family there. He does not actually know anyone in the village, but is pleasantly relieved to be greeted by undercover police posing as his family, with Yang as his sister. The local police pretend to arrest Ka-Kui in a restaurant, but Ka-Kui and Yang (also a martial-arts expert) escape after a big fight, which concludes with the faked killing of a policeman. This confirms Panther's trust in them.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Chaibat welcomes Ka-Kui and Yang to his luxurious hide-out. He takes them with him to a big [[opium]] grower's fortified compound in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] of [[Thailand]], for a meeting of big-time [[heroin]] traffickers. During the meeting, Chaibat's gang attack from outside while Ka-Kui and Yang protect him inside. In a huge gun battle, Chaibat's gang kill the rival traffickers and their guards, and smash up the compound. The grower survives, but will now sell only to Chaibat at Chaibat's price.\n\nThe action then shifts to [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], where Chaibat's wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is in prison, facing the [[Capital_punishment_in_Malaysia|death penalty]] for an unspecified crime. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, because only she knows the secret codes to his [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]], and will not reveal them to him unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.\n\nA new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. He has told her he's on assignment. Ka-Kui evades May at first, but she sees him at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat's gang are staying, with the beautiful Yang, and confronts him in a jealous rage. This nearly blows Ka-Kui's cover, but Panther is persuaded that May is angry because Ka-Kui tried to proposition her as a prostitute. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang \u2013 their cover now blown \u2013 to help free Chen.\n\nChaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account.

He is sent to [[Guangzhou]], where the Chinese police force's Interpol director, Inspector Jessica Yang ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), briefs him on his next assignment. The target is Chaibat, a drug lord based in Hong Kong. To infiltrate Chaibat's organization, Ka-Kui is to get close to Chaibat's henchman Panther, who is in a Chinese prison. Ka-Kui, posing as a petty criminal prisoner, manages Panther's escape with the connivance of the guards. Grateful, Panther invites Ka-Kui to go with him to Hong Kong and join Chaibat's gang. Panther meets up with some of his other men, and vouches for Ka-Kui. The group heads for Hong Kong.\n\nOn the way, they pass through Ka-Kui's supposed home village, and Panther insists that Ka-Kui visit his family there. He does not actually know anyone in the village, but is pleasantly relieved to be greeted by undercover police posing as his family, with Yang as his sister. The local police pretend to arrest Ka-Kui in a restaurant, but Ka-Kui and Yang (also a martial-arts expert) escape after a big fight, which concludes with the faked killing of a policeman. This confirms Panther's trust in them.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Chaibat welcomes Ka-Kui and Yang to his luxurious hide-out. He takes them with him to a big [[opium]] grower's fortified compound in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] of [[Thailand]], for a meeting of big-time [[heroin]] traffickers. During the meeting, Chaibat's gang attack from outside while Ka-Kui and Yang protect him inside. In a huge gun battle, Chaibat's gang kill the rival traffickers and their guards, and smash up the compound. The grower survives, but will now sell only to Chaibat at Chaibat's price.\n\nThe action then shifts to [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], where Chaibat's wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is in prison, facing the [[Capital_punishment_in_Malaysia|death penalty]] for an unspecified crime. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, because only she knows the secret codes to his [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss bank account]], and will not reveal them to him unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.\n\nA new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. He has told her he's on assignment. Ka-Kui evades May at first, but she sees him at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat's gang are staying, with the beautiful Yang, and confronts him in a jealous rage. This nearly blows Ka-Kui's cover, but Panther is persuaded that May is angry because Ka-Kui tried to proposition her as a prostitute. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang \u2013 their cover now blown \u2013 to help free Chen.\n\nChaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[Royal Hong Kong Police|RHKP]] Inspector \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-Kui]] / Chen Chia-Chu / Lin Fu Sheng (doubled by Stanley Tong)\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] Inspector \"Jessica\" Yang Chien-Hua / Hannah Lin\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as May, Kevin's girlfriend\n* [[Bill Tung]] as \"Uncle\" Bill Wong, RHKP [[deputy commissioner]] and Kevin's boss\n* [[Philip Chan (actor)|Philip Chan]] as [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|RHKP Commissioner]] Y.K.

Connoisseurs will find Chan's helicopter-train chase far riskier, more exciting and more believable than its mates in ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[The Living Daylights]]''.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/supercopharr.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=More Kicks From Jackie Chan | date=18 March 1997}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in 2009, director [[Quentin Tarantino]] named ''Police Story III'' as one of his favorite films of the past seventeen years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Top 20 Films of the Past 17 Years|url=http://www.filmjunk.com/2009/08/17/quentin-tarantinos-top-20-films-of-the-past-17-years/|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>  He stated that ''Supercop'' features the \"greatest stunts ever filmed in any movie ever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-tarantinotop20/17/ |title=Quentin Tarantino's Top 20 Favorite Films |accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref> In 2016 during a roundtable discussion, when asked which movie scene he would love to save for the last of humanity to see, he named the final scene of the movie as his choice. <ref>{{cite web|title=TheHollywoodReporter Roundtable Interview With Directors|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7qKKQrSBY|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>\nIn 2014, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/best-action-movies|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=The 100 best action movies|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> ''Supercop'' was listed at 75th place on this list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116140621/www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-100-best-action-movies-80-71|work=Time Out|accessdate=7 November 2014|title=The 100 best action movies: 80-71}}</ref>\n\n==Dimension version==\nThe [[Dimension Films]] version, which was distributed theatrically in North America in 1996, was dubbed into [[American English]] with the participation of [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Michelle Yeoh]].\n\nAmong the changes was the addition of a new score. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]' rendition of \"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\" plays over the end credits, followed by a song specially written and performed for the film by the band [[Devo]], entitled \"Supercop\".\n\nThis release was cut by approximately 10 minutes. These cuts include:\n* Scenes of the police superiors getting a briefing about drug-related crimes.\n* The police superiors discussing a plan to send Jackie Chan's character on an undercover mission.\n* A scene where Yeoh tries to teach Chan about Mainland China.\n* A longer version of the meeting with Chaibat in which the sexy women lounging about his mansion are revealed as drug addicts.\n\n==DVD releases==\n* The film was given a theatrical and VHS release in the United Kingdom.\n* In January 1998, [[Dimension Films]] released their ''Supercop'' version.\n* In Hong Kong, the film was initially released by [[Mega Star Video Distribution, Ltd.|Megastar]] and later, [[Deltamac]]. In 2004, it was re-released by [[Intercontinental Video Limited|IVL]]. This version was contained within a Police Story trilogy DVD boxset (Region 0 [[NTSC]]). All Hong Kong DVDs contain the original cut.\n* In January 2009, the film was re-released in the west by [[Dragon Dynasty]] and [[the Weinstein Company]]. Although it has the original [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] soundtrack, it is cut to fit the visuals of the included Dimension ''Supercop'' version. It does not contain any of the scenes specific to the Hong Kong version.\n* Hong Kong based company Kam & Ronsom Enterprise announced that they would release the first three ''Police Story'' films on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in June 2009.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/asia/china/e3i4e9a6c684b313de0498ce32a2dae08e3 Bruce Lee hits Blu-ray Disc]</ref>\n\n==Spinoff==\n{{Main|Supercop 2}}\nMichelle Yeoh went on to star in a 1993 [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''[[Supercop 2]]'' or ''Project S''. Though it features a [[cameo appearance]] by [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Bill Tung]] reprises his role as \"Uncle\" Bill, this film is not a proper part of the ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'' series.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe film inspired two missions in the 2004 videogame [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]], both of which were taken from the film's final scenes. The game's last mission, \"End of The Line\", where C.J must chase a firetruck with a red open-top car and catch Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson was taken from the scene where Jackie must chase a van using a red open-top car to catch Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh).\n\nThe mission \"Wrong Side of The Tracks\", where the player must follow a train from a dirt bike was taken from the scene where Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh) follows the train on a similar dirt bike.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Supercop (soundtrack)}}\nTwo songs \"I Have My Way\" (\u6211\u6709\u6211\u8def\u5411) sung by Jackie Chan and \"I Just Want You to Understand\" (\u6211\u53ea\u60f3\u4f60\u61c2) sung by Taiwanese musician [[Jonathan Lee (musician)|Jonathan Lee]], both lyricized by Hong Kong songwriter [[James Wong Jim|James Wong]] and composed by Lee,<ref>{{cite book |date=February 2016 |first=Zhu |last=Wang  |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/%E5%94%B1%E6%88%91%E9%80%8D%E9%81%A5%E8%B0%83_%E9%BB%84%E9%9C%91%E7%9A%84%E6%AD%8C%E5%BD%B1%E6%B1%9F%E6%B9%96/RkRyDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22%E6%88%91%E6%9C%89%E6%88%91%E8%B7%AF%E5%90%91%22&pg=PT34&printsec=frontcover&bsq=%22%E6%88%91%E6%9C%89%E6%88%91%E8%B7%AF%E5%90%91%22 |script-title=zh:\u5531\u6211\u900d\u9059\u8abf:\u9ec3\u9711\u7684\u6b4c\u5f71\u6c5f\u6e56 |publisher=Guizho Publishing (\u8d35\u5dde\u4eba\u6c11\u51fa\u7248\u793e) |isbn=978-7-221-12800-3 }}</ref> are featured as theme songs for the Asian versions of the film.\n\nA soundtrack containing alternative rock and hip hop song was released on 30 July 1996 by [[Interscope Records]].
