A near-divine being, he is also credited as the author of most of [[Mandala 3]] of the [[Rigveda]], including [[Gayatri Mantra]]. The [[Puranas]] mention that only 24 rishis since antiquity have understood the whole meaning of\u2014and thus wielded the whole power of\u2014Gayatri Mantra. Vishvamitra is supposed to be the first, and [[Yajnavalkya]] the last.\n\nThe story of Vishvamitra is narrated in the [[Valmiki Ramayana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net |title=Valmiki Ramayana |publisher=Valmikiramayan.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>  \n\nVishvamitra was a Lodh king in ancient India, also called Kaushik (descendant of Kusha) and belonged to [[Amavasu Dynasty]]. Vishwamitra was originally the [[Chandravanshi]] ([[Somavanshi]]) King of Kanyakubja. He was a valiant warrior and the great-grandson of a great king named Kusha. ''Valmiki Ramayana'', prose 51 of Bala Kanda, starts with the story of Vishvamitra:\n\n{{quote|There was a king named Kusha (not to be confused with [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], son of [[Rama]]), a brainchild of [[Brahma]] and Kusha's son was the powerful and verily righteous Kushanabha. One who is highly renowned by the name [[Gaadhi]] was the son of Kushanabha and Gaadhi's son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra. Vishvamitra ruled the earth and this great-resplendent king ruled the kingdom for many thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History, and Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwsYAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company|year=1870|page=341}}</ref>}}\n\nHis story also appears in various Puranas; however, with variations from ''Ramayana''. [[Vishnu Purana]] and [[Harivamsha]] chapter 27 (dynasty of Amaavasu) of ''Mahabharata'' narrates the birth of Vishvamitra. According to [[Vishnu Purana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/viswamitra.htm |title=Vi\u015bwamitra |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Kushanabha married a damsel of Purukutsa dynasty (later called as Shatamarshana lineage - descendants of the [[Ikshvaku]] king Trasadasyu) and had a son by name Gaadhi, who had a daughter named Satyavati (not to be confused with the [[Satyavati]] of ''Mahabharata'').\n\nSatyavati was married to an old man known as Ruchika who was foremost among the race of [[Bhrigu]]. Ruchika desired a son having the qualities of a good person and so he gave Satyavati a sacrificial offering ([[charu]]) which he had prepared to achieve this objective. He also gave Satyavati's mother another charu to make her conceive a son with the character of a [[Kshatriya]] at her request. But Satyavati's mother privately asked Satyavati to exchange her charu with her. This resulted in Satyavati's mother giving birth to Vishvamitra, and Satyavati gave birth to [[Jamadagni]], father of [[Parashurama]], a person with qualities of a warrior\n\n==Conflict with Vashista==\n[[File:Viswamitra taking with Vasista.jpg|thumb|left|Viswamitra talking with Vasista]]\n[[File:Coin of Dharaghosha king of the Audumbaras.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Dharaghosha, king of the [[Audumbaras]], in the [[Indo-Greek]] style, with depiction of Vishvamitra, circa 100 BCE.<ref name=\"Rapson\"/><br>'''Obv:''' Standing figure, probably of Vishvamitra, [[Kharoshthi]] legend, around: ''Mahadevasa Dharaghoshasa/Odumbarisa'' \"Great Lord King Dharaghosha/Prince of Audumabara\", across: ''Vi\u00e7vamitra'' \"Vishvamitra\".<br>'''Rev:''' Trident battle-axe, tree with railing, [[Brahmi]] legend identical in content to the obverse.<ref name=\"Rapson\">Ancient India, from the earliest times to the first century, A.D by Rapson, E.

He proudly goes to Va\u015bi\u0219tha's ashram again and uses all kinds of powerful weapons to destroy Vashista and his hermitage.

He asked Vasistha to hand over her but Vasistha refused to do so saying she actually belongs to Devas and not him. King Kaushika became angry and attacked Vasishtha with all his forces. However, he was defeated by Vasistha by the power of his penance and was somehow rescued by Vamdeva.\n\nHe asked Vamdeva, how can Vasistha defeat all his might on his alone. Vamdeva told him this happened due to Vasishtha's Brahmashakti. Kaushika then wanted to become like Vasistha. Doing penance guided by Vamdeva, King Kaushika became Vishwamitra.\n\n==Tapasya==\n[[File:Viswamitra and Menaka.jpg|thumb|Viswamitra and Menaka]]\nMenaka was born during the churning of the ocean by the Devas and Asuras and was one of the most beautiful apsaras (celestial nymph) in the world with quick intelligence and innate talent. However, Menaka desired a family. Due to his penance and the power he achieved through it, Vishwamitra frightened the gods and even tried to create another heaven. Indra, frightened by Vishwamitra's powers, sent Menaka from heaven to earth to lure him and break his meditation. Menaka successfully incited Vishwamitra's lust and passion. She succeeded in breaking the meditation of Vishwamitra. However, she fell in genuine love with him and a baby was born to them who later grew in Sage Kanva's ashram and came to be called Shakuntala. Later Shakuntala falls in love with King Dushyanta and gives birth to a child called Bharata. \n\nHowever, later Vishwamitra merely cursed Menaka to be separated from him forever, for he loved her as well and knew that she had lost all devious intentions towards him long ago.\n\nVishwamitra was also tested by the Apsara Rambha. She, however was cursed by Vishwamitra.\n\n==Rise to Brahmarishi==\n\nAfter cursing Menaka, Vishwamitra goes to the highest mountain of [[Himalayas]] to perform an even more severe tapasya for over 1000 years. He ceases to eat and reduces his breathing to a bare minimum.\n\nHe is tested again by Indra, who comes as a poor [[Brahmin]] begging for food just as Kaushika is ready to break a fast of many years by eating some rice. Kaushika instantly gives his food away to Indra and resumes his meditation. Kaushika also finally masters his passions, refusing to be provoked by any of Indra's testing and seductive interferences.\n\nAt the penultimate culmination of a multi-thousand-year journey, Kaushika's yogic power is at a peak. At this point, Brahma, as the head of [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by Indra, names Kaushika a [[Brahmarishi]] and names him ''Vishvamitra'' or ''Friend of All'' for his unlimited compassion. He then goes to meet Vashishta. It was customary that, if a sage was greeted by an equal or superior person, the sage would also greet the person. If the sage was greeted by an inferior person, the sage would simply bless them. Initially, when Vishwamitra greeted Vashishta with the pride of being a new Brahmarishi in heart, Vashishta simply blessed him. Suddenly all pride and desire left Vishwamitra's heart and he became a clean and clear Brahmarishi. When Vishwamitra turned back to leave, Vashishta realised a change of heart and proceeded to greet Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra is also embraced by [[Vashista]] and their enmity is instantly ended.\n\n==Gayatri mantra==\n\nVishvamitra is said to have found [[Gayatri Mantra]]. It is a verse from a sukta of Rigveda (Mandala 3.62.10). G\u0101yatr\u012b is the name of the [[Vedic meter]] in which the verse is composed.\n\nGayatri mantra is repeated and cited very widely in Vedic literature{{sfn|Bloomfield|1906|p=392b}} and praised in several well-known classical Hindu texts such as [[Manusmriti]] (\"there is nothing greater than the ''Savitri (Gayatri) Mantra''.\", Manu II, 83),{{sfn|Dutt|2006|p=51}} [[Harivamsa]]{{sfn|Vedas|2003|p=15\u201316}} and [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Rahman|2005|p=300}}{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1994|p=266}} The mantra is an important part of the [[upanayana]] ceremony for young males in [[Hinduism]] and has long been recited by [[dvija]] men as part of their daily rituals. Modern [[Hindu reform movements]] spread the practice of the mantra to include women and all castes and its recitation is now widespread.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=127}}{{sfn|Lipner|1994|p=53}}\n\n==Legends==\n\nVishvamitra is featured in many legends and in different works of the [[Sanatana dharma]].\n\n===Trisanku===\n[[File:Vishwamitra.jpg|thumb|Vishwamitra]]\nAnother story Vishvamitra is known for is his creation of his own version of ''Svarga'' or heaven, called ''Trisanku Svarga''.\n\nWhen a proud King [[Trishanku|Trisanku]] asked his [[Guru]] [[Vashista]] to send him to heaven in his own body, guru responded that the body cannot ascend to heaven. King Trisanku then asked Vashista's hundred sons to send him to heaven. The sons, believing that Trisanku should not come to them after their father had refused, took outrage and cursed Trisanku to be a Chandala. Trisanku was transformed into a person with body smeared of ash, clothed in black and wearing iron jewelry. Unrecognizable to his subjects, he was driven out of the kingdom.\n\nIn his exile, Trisanku came across the sage Vishvamitra, who agreed to help him. Vishvamitra organized a great sacrifice and ritual propitiating the [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s, pleading that they accept Trisanku into heaven. Not one Deva responded. Angered, Vishvamitra used his yogic powers and ordered Trisanku to rise to heaven. Miraculously, Trisanku rose into the sky until he reached heaven, where he was pushed back down by [[Indra]].\n\nEnraged even more by this, Vishvamitra commenced the creation of another Universe (including another Brahma) for Trisanku. He had only completed the Universe when [[Brihaspati]] ordered him to stop. Trisanku, however, did not fully transcend through Trisanku [[Svarga]] created for him. He remained fixed and upside-down in the sky and was transformed into a [[constellation]], which is now known as [[Crux]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130045439/http://spaceyuga.com/crux-constellation-hindu-mythological-name-trishanku/|title=Crux \u2013 Trishanku|date=30 January 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n \nIn the process of forming a new universe, Vishvamitra used up all the tapas he had gained from his austerities. Therefore, after the Trisanku episode, Vishvamitra had to start his prayers again to attain the status of a [[Brahmarshi]] and become an equal of Vashista.\n\n===Harishchandra/Ambarisha's sacrifice===\n[[File:Rama breaking the bow.jpg|left|thumb|Rama breaking the bow]]\nWhile undertaking a penance, Kaushika helps a boy named [[Shunashepa]] who has been sold by his parents to be sacrificed at [[Harishchandra]]/[[Ambarisha]]'s [[yagna]] to please [[Varuna]]. The king's son [[Rohit]] does not want to be the one sacrificed, as was originally promised to Varuna, so young [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] is taken. A devastated and terrified [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] falls at the feet of Kaushika, who is deep in meditation and begs for his help.<ref name=\"p1\">Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.92.</ref>\n\nKaushika teaches secret mantras to Sunashepa. The boy sings these mantras at the ceremony, is blessed by [[Indra]] and [[Varuna]] and Ambarisha's ceremony is completed.\n\nIn another version of the story, Sunahshepa is lost son of Vishvamitra. When Vishvamitra was Prince of Bharats (Kaushik) - and his name was Vishwarath then, he was abducted by the enemy king Shambar. There, Shambar's daughter, Ugra, falls in love with Vishvarath. Ugra convinces Prince Vishvarath to marry her. Looking at the good character of Vishvarath, Shambar also agrees for the marriage. Soon after the marriage, the Bharatas win the battle against Shambar. When theu found their Prince Vishvarath alive, they feel happy but they could not accept Ugra as their future queen as she is an Asura. To convert Ugra into an Aryan, Vishvarath creates Gayatri Mantra, but people still refuse to accept her. Soon she gives birth to a son, but to save the son from the angry people, the greatest female sage [[Lopamudra]] sends the child to a hidden place. To Lopamudra and Vishvarath's sadness, people kill Ugra. But the son is saved, without the knowledge of Vishvarath. This child grows young and he comes to sacrifice himself in the ceremony of Ambarisha (or King Harishchandra).<ref>Munshi, K. M. (1933). Munshi Granthavali : 7.

At this point, Brahma, as the head of [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by Indra, names Kaushika a [[Brahmarishi]] and names him ''Vishvamitra'' or ''Friend of All'' for his unlimited compassion. He then goes to meet Vashishta. It was customary that, if a sage was greeted by an equal or superior person, the sage would also greet the person. If the sage was greeted by an inferior person, the sage would simply bless them. Initially, when Vishwamitra greeted Vashishta with the pride of being a new Brahmarishi in heart, Vashishta simply blessed him. Suddenly all pride and desire left Vishwamitra's heart and he became a clean and clear Brahmarishi. When Vishwamitra turned back to leave, Vashishta realised a change of heart and proceeded to greet Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra is also embraced by [[Vashista]] and their enmity is instantly ended.\n\n==Gayatri mantra==\n\nVishvamitra is said to have found [[Gayatri Mantra]]. It is a verse from a sukta of Rigveda (Mandala 3.62.10). G\u0101yatr\u012b is the name of the [[Vedic meter]] in which the verse is composed.\n\nGayatri mantra is repeated and cited very widely in Vedic literature{{sfn|Bloomfield|1906|p=392b}} and praised in several well-known classical Hindu texts such as [[Manusmriti]] (\"there is nothing greater than the ''Savitri (Gayatri) Mantra''.\", Manu II, 83),{{sfn|Dutt|2006|p=51}} [[Harivamsa]]{{sfn|Vedas|2003|p=15\u201316}} and [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Rahman|2005|p=300}}{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1994|p=266}} The mantra is an important part of the [[upanayana]] ceremony for young males in [[Hinduism]] and has long been recited by [[dvija]] men as part of their daily rituals. Modern [[Hindu reform movements]] spread the practice of the mantra to include women and all castes and its recitation is now widespread.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=127}}{{sfn|Lipner|1994|p=53}}\n\n==Legends==\n\nVishvamitra is featured in many legends and in different works of the [[Sanatana dharma]].\n\n===Trisanku===\n[[File:Vishwamitra.jpg|thumb|Vishwamitra]]\nAnother story Vishvamitra is known for is his creation of his own version of ''Svarga'' or heaven, called ''Trisanku Svarga''.\n\nWhen a proud King [[Trishanku|Trisanku]] asked his [[Guru]] [[Vashista]] to send him to heaven in his own body, guru responded that the body cannot ascend to heaven. King Trisanku then asked Vashista's hundred sons to send him to heaven. The sons, believing that Trisanku should not come to them after their father had refused, took outrage and cursed Trisanku to be a Chandala. Trisanku was transformed into a person with body smeared of ash, clothed in black and wearing iron jewelry. Unrecognizable to his subjects, he was driven out of the kingdom.\n\nIn his exile, Trisanku came across the sage Vishvamitra, who agreed to help him. Vishvamitra organized a great sacrifice and ritual propitiating the [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s, pleading that they accept Trisanku into heaven. Not one Deva responded. Angered, Vishvamitra used his yogic powers and ordered Trisanku to rise to heaven. Miraculously, Trisanku rose into the sky until he reached heaven, where he was pushed back down by [[Indra]].\n\nEnraged even more by this, Vishvamitra commenced the creation of another Universe (including another Brahma) for Trisanku. He had only completed the Universe when [[Brihaspati]] ordered him to stop. Trisanku, however, did not fully transcend through Trisanku [[Svarga]] created for him. He remained fixed and upside-down in the sky and was transformed into a [[constellation]], which is now known as [[Crux]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130045439/http://spaceyuga.com/crux-constellation-hindu-mythological-name-trishanku/|title=Crux \u2013 Trishanku|date=30 January 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n \nIn the process of forming a new universe, Vishvamitra used up all the tapas he had gained from his austerities. Therefore, after the Trisanku episode, Vishvamitra had to start his prayers again to attain the status of a [[Brahmarshi]] and become an equal of Vashista.\n\n===Harishchandra/Ambarisha's sacrifice===\n[[File:Rama breaking the bow.jpg|left|thumb|Rama breaking the bow]]\nWhile undertaking a penance, Kaushika helps a boy named [[Shunashepa]] who has been sold by his parents to be sacrificed at [[Harishchandra]]/[[Ambarisha]]'s [[yagna]] to please [[Varuna]]. The king's son [[Rohit]] does not want to be the one sacrificed, as was originally promised to Varuna, so young [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] is taken. A devastated and terrified [[Shunahshepa|Sunashepa]] falls at the feet of Kaushika, who is deep in meditation and begs for his help.<ref name=\"p1\">Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.92.</ref>\n\nKaushika teaches secret mantras to Sunashepa. The boy sings these mantras at the ceremony, is blessed by [[Indra]] and [[Varuna]] and Ambarisha's ceremony is completed.\n\nIn another version of the story, Sunahshepa is lost son of Vishvamitra. When Vishvamitra was Prince of Bharats (Kaushik) - and his name was Vishwarath then, he was abducted by the enemy king Shambar. There, Shambar's daughter, Ugra, falls in love with Vishvarath. Ugra convinces Prince Vishvarath to marry her. Looking at the good character of Vishvarath, Shambar also agrees for the marriage. Soon after the marriage, the Bharatas win the battle against Shambar. When theu found their Prince Vishvarath alive, they feel happy but they could not accept Ugra as their future queen as she is an Asura. To convert Ugra into an Aryan, Vishvarath creates Gayatri Mantra, but people still refuse to accept her. Soon she gives birth to a son, but to save the son from the angry people, the greatest female sage [[Lopamudra]] sends the child to a hidden place. To Lopamudra and Vishvarath's sadness, people kill Ugra. But the son is saved, without the knowledge of Vishvarath. This child grows young and he comes to sacrifice himself in the ceremony of Ambarisha (or King Harishchandra).<ref>Munshi, K. M. (1933). Munshi Granthavali : 7.

Painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]\n\nIn the [[Indian epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]'', Vishvamitra is the preceptor of [[Rama]], prince of [[Ayodhya]] and seventh [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]].\n\nVishvamitra gives them the knowledge of the ''Devastras'' or celestial weaponry [bala and adi bala], trains them in advanced religion and guides them to kill powerful demons[Rakshasas] like [[Tataka]], [[Maricha]] and [[Subahu]].

There were 1,537 patients enrolled over all trials, with 79% of the participants being female. There were 10 single dose analgesia trials included in the new drug application.  All studies were similarly designed: after completion of a procedure in which pain was rated as moderate or severe, patients would be randomized into various treatment groups.  The treatment groups included: ibuprofen only, hydrocodone only, Vicoprofen (hydrocodone/ibuprofen), and placebo. The participant's pain would then be tracked over the next several hours by the self reporting of pain scores.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere were four multiple dose trials included in the new drug application.  These studies were all completed in the U.S., in settings including burn unit, post-operatively, and chronic pain settings.  A total of 683 patients were enrolled in all of the multiple dose trials, with 57% of the participants being women. These studies also looked at self reported pain intensities over a 5-day period of multiple dosing. In these studies, patients were either given the trial drug Vicoprofen or one of two an active controls: codeine with acetaminophen (Tylenol #3) or oxycodone with acetaminophen (Percocet), depending on the trial.  Patients were allowed to take a dose as needed but no more than every 4 to 6 hours for up to 5 days.

There were 1,537 patients enrolled over all trials, with 79% of the participants being female. There were 10 single dose analgesia trials included in the new drug application.  All studies were similarly designed: after completion of a procedure in which pain was rated as moderate or severe, patients would be randomized into various treatment groups.  The treatment groups included: ibuprofen only, hydrocodone only, Vicoprofen (hydrocodone/ibuprofen), and placebo. The participant's pain would then be tracked over the next several hours by the self reporting of pain scores.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere were four multiple dose trials included in the new drug application.  These studies were all completed in the U.S., in settings including burn unit, post-operatively, and chronic pain settings.  A total of 683 patients were enrolled in all of the multiple dose trials, with 57% of the participants being women. These studies also looked at self reported pain intensities over a 5-day period of multiple dosing. In these studies, patients were either given the trial drug Vicoprofen or one of two an active controls: codeine with acetaminophen (Tylenol #3) or oxycodone with acetaminophen (Percocet), depending on the trial.  Patients were allowed to take a dose as needed but no more than every 4 to 6 hours for up to 5 days. These trials measured efficacy based on parameters including self reported pain scores, number of doses used, and duration of treatment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n=== Cost ===\nThe average wholesale price (AWP) of generic Vicoprofen varies based on the strength of the preparation.  Pricing data gathered from Lexicomp in October 2017 indicates the AWP for a 100 count bottle of 7.5&nbsp;mg/200&nbsp;mg strength to be $114.62, a 100 count of 5&nbsp;mg/200&nbsp;mg strength to be $356.62 and a 100 count of 10&nbsp;mg/200&nbsp;mg strength to be $470.35.<ref name=\":1\" /> These prices are all for generic equivalents of Vicoprofen.\n\n=== Utilization ===\nIn 2003, at the time of the approval announcement for the first generic equivalent, it was reported that annual sales of brand name Vicoprofen totaled $104 million.<ref name=\":4\" />  According to IMS, the Hydrocodone/Ibuprofen tablets 7.5&nbsp;mg/200&nbsp;mg, had an estimated market size of $15.7 million for the 12 months preceding May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aurobindousa.com/uncategorized/aurobindo-receives-final-fda-approval-for-hydrocodone-bitartrate-and-ibuprofen-tablets-c-ii/|title=Aurobindo receives final FDA Approval for Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets (C-II)|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=www.aurobindousa.com/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol]]\n* [[Hydrocodone/aspirin]]\n* [[Oxycodone/ibuprofen]]\n* [[Oxycodone/paracetamol]]\n* [[Percodan|Oxycodone/aspirin]]\n* [[Oxycodone/naloxone]]\n* [[Morphine/naltrexone]]\n* [[Fentanyl/fluanisone]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Analgesics}}\n{{Opioidergics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hydrocodone ibuprofen}}\n[[Category:Combination analgesics]]\n[[Category:AbbVie Inc. brands]]\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "added FDA UNII to drug box", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocodone/ibuprofen"}

During the [[Edo period]], it was an exclave of [[Kurohane Domain]] from [[Nasu District, Tochigi|Nasu]]. After the [[Meiji restoration]], Mashiko, Nanai and Tano villages were created within Haga District on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the municipalities system. Mashiko was elevated to town status on March 1, 1895. Mashiko annexed Nanai and Tano villages on June 1, 1954.\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Mashiko is heavily dependent on tourism from its ceramics crafts industry. The town is also a [[bedroom community]] for neighboring Mooka and Utsunomiya.\n\n==Education==\nMashiko has four [[primary school]]s, three [[middle school]]s and two [[high school]]s.  There are also 6 nurseries (Yawaragi, Nanai, Aoba, Midori, Mashiko and Tano) and 2 kindergartens (Nanai and Takara).\n\n==Transportation==\n===Railway===\n*[[Mooka Railway]] \u2013 [[Mooka Railway Mooka Line|Mooka Line]])\n**{{STN|Mashiko}} - {{STN|Nanai}}\n\n===Highway===\n* [[Japan National Route 121]]\n* [[Japan National Route 123]]\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Found MUJI Masukoyaki (6910169491).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mashikoyaki]]\nMashiko is known for its [[pottery]], called {{nihongo|''[[Mashiko ware|mashikoyaki]]''|\u76ca\u5b50\u713c}}. Early pottery in Mashiko dates back to the [[J\u014dmon period|J\u014dmon]] and [[Yayoi period]]s. ''Mashikoyaki'' is often thought of as simple and rustic in style, with brown and maybe a little red [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]], but modern pottery made in Mashiko today is found in many styles, on account of the creative freedom brought to Mashiko by [[Shoji Hamada]]. Modern ''Mashikoyaki'' dates only to 1853, when a potter discovered that local clay here was ideal for ceramics.  The style was popularized in 1930 when Hamada, later designated as a [[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasure]], set up a kiln in Mashiko. Hamada\u2032s student, [[Tatsuz\u014d Shimaoka]], was also designated as a Living National Treasure and worked in Mashiko from 1953 until his death in 2007.\n\nMashiko is a [[folkware]] kiln site that is unlike some of the other older kiln sites around Japan. The town is open to newcomers whether or not they are potters or of other professional backgrounds in arts, sciences and education. In Japan, craftsmen are usually born into their profession, but in Mashiko, anyone can become a potter. Following Shoji Hamada, people looking to return to a more traditional Japanese lifestyle settled in the area.<ref>Holmes, Ann Sommer.

It was founded in 1924 by [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]] and originally produced general purpose clothing. With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in the 1930s, Boss began to produce and sell Nazi uniforms. Boss would eventually supply the wartime German government with uniforms for organizations such as the [[Hitler Youth]] and [[Waffen-SS]], resulting in a large boost in sales. \n\nAfter [[World War II]] and the founder's death in 1948, Hugo Boss started to turn its focus from uniforms to men's suits. The company went public in 1988 and introduced a fragrance line that same year, added men's and women's wear diffusion lines in 1997, a full women's collection in 2000, as well as children's clothing in 2006\u20132007 and has since evolved into a major global fashion house. {{As of|2018||df=}} it owned more than 1,113 retail stores worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/294103/number-of-hugo-boss-stores-worldwide/|title=Number of Hugo Boss stores worldwide 2009-2018|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Boss 1933 adv.jpg|thumb|1933 ad placed by Hugo Boss for Nazi uniforms, work, sports and rainwear but we will refund Boss Brewery \u00a325k]]\nIn 1923, [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]] founded his own clothing company in [[Metzingen]], Germany, where it is still based.<ref name=NYT>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/business/worldbusiness/a-small-town-in-germany-fits-hugo-boss-nicely.html|author=Landler, Mark|title=A Small Town in Germany Fits Hugo Boss Nicely|date=April 12, 2005|page=C00001\n}}</ref> In 1924, he started a factory along with two partners.

By 1960, the company was producing ready made suits. In 1969, Eugen retired, leaving the company to his sons Jochen and Uwe, who began international development. In 1970, the first Boss branded suits were produced, with the brand becoming a registered trademark in 1977. This was followed by the start of the company's long association with motorsport, sponsoring [[Formula One]] driver [[Niki Lauda]], and later the [[McLaren|McLaren Racing]] team.\n\nIn 1984, the first Boss branded fragrance appeared. This helped the company gain the required growth for listing on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] the following year. The brand began sponsorship of golf with [[Bernhard Langer]] in 1986 and tennis with the [[Davis Cup]] in 1987. In 1989, Boss launched its first licensed [[sunglasses]]. Later that year, the company was bought by a Japanese group.<ref name=\"Luxury\">{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Marzotto]] textile group acquired a 77.5% stake for $165,000,000 in 1991,<ref name=\"Luxury\"/><ref name=\"Marzotto S.p.A\">{{cite news|title=Marzotto S.p.A.|date=November 2, 1991|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/02/business/company-news-marzotto-spa.html?src=pm|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}</ref> the Hugo and Baldessarini brands were introduced in 1993.
