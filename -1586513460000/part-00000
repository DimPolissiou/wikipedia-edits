'''''LOTR TCG''''') is an out-of-print [[collectible card game]] produced by [[Decipher, Inc.]] Released November [[2001 in games|2001]], it is based on [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy and the [[J.

However, since the game's print run has ended, sales for online cards have been stopped and the servers closed in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/|title=Default Parallels Plesk Panel Page|website=lotronline.decipher.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040304123936/http://lotronline.decipher.com/|archivedate=4 March 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Game concept==\n''The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game'' is a game for two or more players, each of who uses his or her own deck consisting of equal numbers of ''Free Peoples'' and ''Shadow'' cards, with a minimum of 30 of each. On a player's turn they are considered to be the Free Peoples player and their [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] and Free Peoples cards both in their Support Area and on their characters are ''active''. A player uses his Free Peoples cards to attempt to traverse the site-path and destroy the [[One Ring]] by reaching the ninth site. Each of his or her opponents, the Shadow Players, use their Shadow cards to prevent this by attempting to kill or corrupt the ring-bearer, or by forcing the Fellowship to slow down long enough for their Fellowship to race to victory. At the end of each turn the position of Free Peoples player rotates to the next player in turn. The game is won by the first Free Peoples player to survive to the ninth, and final, site or the last player whose Fellowship is left alive or when you corrupt the opposing fellowships ring-bearer.<ref name=\"DUMMIES\">{{cite book|title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|url=https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf|url-access=registration|series=For Dummies|last1=Kaufeld|first1=John|last2=Smith|first2=Jeremy|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2006|isbn=0470044071|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAn innovative mechanic called the ''twilight pool'' is used as a costing mechanism for cards. Each card has a numerical cost (which can be zero). When the Free Peoples player plays a card, tokens are added to the twilight pool equal to the cost of that card. The Shadow players, however, remove twilight tokens equal to the twilight cost of their cards in order to play their cards. Thus the more powerful cards the Fellowship the Free Peoples player plays, the greater the threat from the Shadow players. Each Free People and Shadow card belonged to a specific culture such as [[Gondor]], [[Gollum]] or [[Isengard]] with cards within a culture complimenting or even requiring one another, but players were free to construct their decks with a mix of cards from any culture.\n\nThroughout a game, a player will play ''companions'' (or Free People characters) to help defend the ring-bearer. When it is his turn to play as the Shadow player, he then can play ''minions'' (or Shadow characters) to attack the opponents companions. The Free People's player (the defender) has the opportunity to choose which of his companions will fight in one-to-one duels, called ''skirmishes'', with the opponents minions. This is called ''assignment''. Since the Free Peoples player wants to defend his ring-bearer, the only way a Shadow player can attack the Free Peoples player is by playing more minions than the Free Peoples player has companions, thus allowing the Shadow player to assign extra minions to any companion he chooses, including the ring-bearer, or by using minions whose game text allows the Shadow player to assign them to the ring-bearer. The character in a skirmish with less strength takes a wound, but if the total difference in strength is double or higher, the losing character is killed immediately instead. Other types of cards are ''possessions'' that character can bear to gain additional bonuses, ''conditions'' that retain their effect until they are discarded and ''events'', which are discarded immediately after being used.\n\nHowever, the Ring-bearer does not only face minions on his journey to destroy the Ring. The Ring-bearer has to resist the temptation of the Ring. In the trading card game, when the ring-bearer succumbs to the temptation of the Ring, ''burdens'' are added and most versions of the [[One Ring]] enable the Ring-bearer to take burdens instead of impending wounds. Each companion has a given resistance stat, and whenever a burden is added, each companion's resistance is lowered by one. Once the ring-bearer's resistance reaches zero, he is corrupted by the power of the ring and the player is eliminated from the game.\n\n==Game sets and distribution==\nWhen the game's run had ended in mid-2007, nineteen sets in total had been released.  Three of expansions (''Expanded [[Middle-earth]] Deluxe Draft Box'', ''The Wraith Collection'', and ''[[Third Age|Age's End]]'') were not available in booster packs.\n\n===The movie years===\nFor the first three years the game's releases followed the movies. A 365 \"base set\" was released each November containing material from the upcoming movie. These were followed by two 122 card expansions at four-month intervals. Each base set and the following two expansions formed a \"block\" named for that base set.\n\nCards were sold in eleven card booster packs consisting of one rare, three uncommon and seven common cards. In approximately one in six packs a common was replaced by a foiled version of a random card from that set. Each set also had two sixty-three card [[Starter pack|starter decks]] containing two copies of a promotional face card, three random rares and sixty fixed commons/uncommons (sets 5 and 6 had sixty card starters with three alternate image rares in place of the random rares).\n\nBetween the second and third expansions of ''[[The Return of the King]]'' block an extra set, ''Reflections'', was released. This consisted of 52 new cards, all foiled, half of which were designated rare plus and half rare. The new cards took material from all three films and material produced by Weta specifically for the game and did not belong to any block. Reflections boosters contained two of the new cards (with one R+ every 2.4 packs) and sixteen repackaged random cards from the first six sets. One of these old cards was always non-English.\n\n===Shadows and beyond===\nIn November 2004 the new base set, ''Shadows'', marked an overhaul to the game. All sets would contain sixty rare, uncommon and common cards each in addition to varied amount of fixed cards, only available in Starter Decks.  Instead of foiling every card, each expansion would only have eighteen pre-selected rare foil cards that would be randomly inserted now into one in every seven booster packs. ''Shadows'' also had four, rather than two, different starter decks. The material used for the cards would also now cover the entire trilogy instead of being tied to the films' releases.\n\nAdditionally, a system of rotation was announced to be introduced to the game. Starting in March 2005 the entire ''Fellowship'' block ceased to be legal for use in the Standard tournament format. Then, each November the oldest block remaining will also be \"rotated out\". Decipher claimed this helped keep the card pool down to a manageable size and would keep established players buying new cards. Detractors claimed it was a money grab and didn't like being forced to purchase what they felt were inferior cards.\n\n===Set list===\nWhere two dates are listed, the first date refers to starter decks and the second to booster packs:\n\n# ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (November 6, 2001) - The first base set that introduced the core mechanics of the game. The cards were divided between [Dwarves], [Elves], [Gandalf], [Gondor] and [Shire] cultures on the Free People sides and [Isengard], [Moria], [Ringwraith] and [Sauron] cultures on the Shadow side. The set is notable for having the largest number of ''Ally'' type of cards, characters who did not travel with the Fellowship and only provided aid through special abilities. Each subsequent set would see fewer and fewer ''Ally'' cards released, until they were completely phased out.\n# ''Mines of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]'' (March 6 & 13, 2002) - The first game expansion introduces the ''Artifact'' type of cards, which functioned similarly to ''possessions'', but did not suffer penalties from cards directly targeting them. This expansion significantly boosted the [Dwarves] and [Moria] faction, most notably featuring the [[Balrog]], which posed a significant danger to the Free People at the unavoidable \"The Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm\" site.\n# ''Realms of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lords'' (June 19 & July 3, 2002) - This set significantly boosted the [Elves] and [Isengard] cultures by adding a large number of Elven allies, introducing Isengard [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]] in addition to the [[Uruk-hai]] and featuring the first playable versions of [[Saruman]].\n# ''[[The Two Towers]]'' (November 6, 2002) - The second base set brought the first significant overhaul of the game scene. The set contained no cards of [Moria], [Ringwraith] and [Sauron] cultures; instead new Shadow cultures of [Dunland] and [Raiders] (which combined the Southrons and the Easterlings) were added along with the [Rohan] Free People culture, and each culture now contained cards which could contain a number of that culture's tokens. The site path from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was completely replaced with the new sites from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'', and sites could now be controlled by Shadow Players and liberated by the Free Peoples.\n# ''[[Battle of Helm's Deep]]'' (March 12, 2003) - This set brought back the [Sauron] culture and also introduced the new [Gollum] culture, which reflecting the character's duality consisted of both Free People and Shadow cards, which could alternatively reinforce or combat one another.\n# ''[[Ent]]s of [[Fangorn forest|Fangorn]]'' (July 2, 2003) - This set brought back the [Ringwraith] culture and introduced new versions of the Ents which were more pro-active in combat than the previous versions, which had specific requirements to be allowed to skirmish. It also contained new cards of the [Moria] culture, including a version of the Balrog who could be played on sites other than ''Underground''.\n# ''[[The Return of the King]]'' (November 5, 2003) - In addition to completely replacing the site path once again, the third base set added the new mechanics of ''threats'' (tokens that had to be assigned as wounds when a companion or ally was killed) and ''initiative'', which either Free Peoples or Shadow player had based on the number of cards in their hands. This set contained no cards of [Dunland], [Isengard] and [Moria] cultures, but added [[Minas Morgul]] orcs to the previously [[Nazg\u00fbl]]-only [Ringwraith] culture.\n# ''Siege of [[Gondor]]'' (March 10, 2004) - This set significantly boosted the [Raiders] culture by enhancing it with the Corsairs of [[Umbar]] and added the Dead Men of Dunharrow to the [Gondor] culture. It also introduces [[Shelob]] as the only other minion for the [Gollum] culture and featured characters with the powerful keyword ''enduring'', who increased in strength after gaining each subsequent wound.\n# ''Reflections'' (May 12, 2004) - Released in between two expansions of ''The Return of the King'' block, this special set was the most innovative at the time. Characters from the Prologue of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' such as [[Elendil]] and [[Gil-Galad]] were introduced for the first time and characters from the books that were abscent from the movies such as [[Glorfindel]] and [[Tom Bombadil]] were added through the designs created by [[Weta Workshop]] specifically for the game. Most importantly, characters other than Frodo were allowed to be the Ringbearer for the first time, featuring versions of [[Galadriel]], [[Boromir]], [[Smeagol]] and others who could bear the [[One Ring]] instead. More alternative Ringbearers would be added in later sets.\n# ''[[Mount Doom]]'' (July 14, 2004) - The final set of the \"movie\" release era introduced new powerful versions of several characters such as [[\u00c9owyn]], [[Arwen]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] that would remain the preferred choices for many of the deck strategies.\n# ''Shadows'' (November 3, 2004) - The release of the new \"base set\" saw the most significant overhaul of the game, which would remain to be seen unfavorably by many players. Existing faction-based Shadow cultures of [Dunland] [Isengard], [Moria], [Raiders] and [Sauron] were replaced with more generic [Orcs], [Uruk-Hai] and [Evil Men], leaving only [Ringwraith] and [Gollum] unchanged and making the majority of the old cards incompatible with the new cultures. Companions other than the Ring-Bearer now also had Resistance, which was affected by both Free People and Shadow cards. Most importantly, instead of a numbered site path based on an individual movie, the nine sites from all three films could now be played in any order and replaced continuously by both Free People and Shadow cards. While this allowed for new gameplay strategies, many felt that the core aspect of the game no longer made sense story-wise.\n# ''[[Ringwraith|Black Rider]]'' (March 18, 2005) - The first post-\"Shadows\" expansion was notable for reprinting many prominent cards from ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' block, which because of the recently introduced block rotation were no longer legal in the Standard tournament format.\n# ''Bloodlines'' (August 12, 2005) - This set introduced the new ''Follower'' card type - minor characters who could provide their ''Aid'' to the Fellowship for a cost that must be paid each turn. It also included the only cards that could change their card type in the form of conditions that could turn into minions and back.\n# ''Expanded [[Middle-earth]] Deluxe Draft Box'' (February 17, 2006) - Similar to \"Reflections\", this 15-card set used artwork by Weta Workshop to represent characters from the books not included in the films, such as [[Halbarad]], [[Grimbeorn]] and [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot|D\u00e1in Ironfoot]].\n# ''The Hunters'' (June 9, 2006) - Released after a significant delay due to the financial problems experienced by [[Decipher, Inc.]], this new base set introduced a new powerful keyword ''Hunter'' and doubled the amount of available Followers.\n# ''The Wraith Collection'' (August 26, 2006) - This Deluxe set had only six cards and consisted entirely of Minions of the [Ringwraith] culture, half of whom used artwork by Weta Workshop to represent the [[Barrow-wight]]s.\n# ''Rise of [[Saruman]]'' (March 1, 2007) - Released after another long delay, this set featured the only Free People character to be represented by more than one culture by introduing the [Rohan] version of [[Aragorn]]. It also contained no less than five different versions of [[Saruman]], one for each culture, including the only Shadow follower in the game.\n# ''Treachery and Deceit'' (May 2007) - Rushed to release before the impending expiration of the license, this set suffered from a lack of playtesting and contained the largest number of overpowered or \"broken\" cards, for which official [[Erratum|errata]] had to be released almost immediately. This set also received the smallest printing of all and remains incredibly hard to find in circulation.\n# ''[[Third Age|Age's End]]'' (June 2007) - Released mere weeks before Decipher's license expired, this final \"farewell\" set consisted of 40 Promo-rarity cards available in a single Deluxe box. It featured the final versions of many promiment characters, some of which have been noted to be the most powerful than any of those that came before.\n\nIn addition a number of boutique products have been released:\n*Oversized Cards (August 2001 - Summer 2003)\n*Promotional Cards (Spring 2002 - Summer 2007)\n*''The Fellowship of the Ring Anthology'' (July 23, 2003)\n*''The Two Towers Anthology'' (February 25, 2004)\n*''The Return of the King Anthology'' (September 2004)\n*''The War of the Ring Anthology'' (September 2005)\n\nThe seven-month delay of ''The Hunters'' expansion release (from November 2005 to June 2006) made the game suffer a significant drop in popularity amongst its players as well as eventually force Decipher Inc. to remove the expansions ''The Great Eye'' and ''Shelob's Lair'' from its intended expansion since Decipher's license for ''Lord of the Rings'' related material was scheduled to expire on June 30, 2007. Following the release of the final expansion ''Age's End'' in June 2007 the game was discontinued and Decipher was forced to stop all production, distribution, and advertising.\n\n==Deck strategies==\nAs the game expanded beyond the first base set, several basic deck strategies were identified and developed. As decks are separated into Shadow and Free People sides, the two sides are to some extent interchangeable, but the best decks usually contain some synergy between both types of cards. Later sets have introduced multiple additional keywords and mechanics and greatly increased the pool of available cards, massively expanding the possibilities for unique strategies, often depending on a specific card.\n\nFor the Free Peoples side, the common basic strategies are ''tank'', ''choke'', ''minion wounding'' and ''mass healing''.\n\n;Tank: Tank decks try to play as much as possible and build up as many companions to combat the opponents Shadow side with force.\n;Choke: Choke decks, the opposite of tank decks, try to put out as little twilight as possible, denying the opponent resources to play their minions, and clogging their hand with unplayable Shadow cards, thus hampering the set up of their Fellowship.\n;Archery/Wounding: Minion wounding decks try to use \"archery fire\" and direct wounding to destroy the minions before they even have a chance to attack.\n;Mass Healing: Mass healing decks rely on the cards that heal companions, with the expectation that if the Free People's removal of wounds can out-pace the Shadow player's placement of wounds, the Fellowship will be unkillable.\n\nFor the Shadow side, the common basic strategies are ''beat-down'', ''swarm'', ''bomb'', '' companion wounding'' and ''corruption''.\n\n;Beat-down: Beat down decks focus on making one or two minions very powerful with big damage bonuses, with the intention of killing all of the companions one by one; eventually killing the ring-bearer.\n;Swarm: Swarm decks have an opposite strategy of a beat-down: their goal is to play as many minions as possible as cheaply as possible. While one swarm minion might not be very powerful by itself, each minion is very cheap which allows many to be played, easily outnumbering the companions and assigning themselves to the Ring-bearer.\n;Bomb: A bomb deck combines the strategies of both beat-down decks and swarm decks. Instead of focusing on one or two powerful minions, they play several minions of medium strength. The goal of a bomb deck is to destroy the weaker companions, and then swarm the Free Peoples player.\n;Archery/Wounding: Archery and wounding decks rely on wounding companions outside of the skirmish so much that they die from their wounds. A variation of this strategy focuses on wounding the ring-bearer and killing him.\n;Corruption: Corruption decks focus on adding enough burdens to corrupt the ring-bearer, or playing cards that require certain conditions to be met to corrupt the ring-bearer outright.\n\n;Discard: Used by both Free People and Shadow sides, discard decks focus on discarding cards from either your opponent's hand or their draw deck, disrupting their strategy and eventually leaving them with no cards to oppose you in later turns.\n\n==Lord of the Rings Online TCG==\nIn 2003 [https://web.archive.org/web/20051224162205/http://www.worlds-apart.com/ Worlds Apart] partnered with Decipher to produce [http://lotronline.decipher.com/ an online version of the Lord of the Rings TCG].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/news/press_archive.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315132734/http://lotronline.decipher.com/news/press_archive.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-15 }}</ref> The online game's rules matched the physical games rules, but utilized tradeable virtual cards that could be purchased through the system via starter decks, booster packs, or in draft. In addition to casual play, the online LOTR TCG system supported tournament play, league play, and sealed play including draft. The online system introduced a number of cards and formats that were online-only (for example, King-block draft packs), and offered players exclusive physical promotional cards and online avatars and movement tokens for participating in online events. The LOTR Online TCG software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/download/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004050120/http://lotronline.decipher.com/download/ |archivedate=2009-10-04 }}</ref> included collection management and robust deckbuilding features. For this reason alone many players have used the software to construct decks and print decklists.\n\nIn 2005 Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) bought Worlds Apart, but continued to support LOTR Online TCG. On May 22, 2007 SOE-Decipher announced the closure of all support for the Online gaming system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/|title=Default Parallels Plesk Panel Page|website=lotronline.decipher.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040304123936/http://lotronline.decipher.com/|archivedate=4 March 2004}}</ref> The LOTR Online TCG software was available and the SOE servers ran until June 30, 2010 when they were shut down for good, though no new cards could be purchased after May, 2007.\n\nThough not sanctioned or approved by Decipher, various alternate ways to play the game online have at various points been developed by players.\n\n==Pro Tour Events==\nIn July 2002, the first pro tour event was held at Origins Game Fair in Columbus, Ohio and it was won by John Lolli. 212 players participated in the event, and first place was $2,500. Christopher Schaut finished in 2nd place winning $1,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decktech.net/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3842&view=2|title=Welcome Lord of the Rings Players|date=30 August 2005|website=archive.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830191851/http://www.decktech.net/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3842&view=2|archivedate=30 August 2005}}</ref> Lolli used a unique deck designed to pass the ring from Frodo to Sam, and deny twilight to its opponent. Almost all of the top players were using later banned card called The Mirror of Galadriel, and Lolli used that strategy against his opponents designing a Minion half of the deck to counteract it.\n\n==Organized play==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Former World Champions include:\n!

Since the rights to produce the Lord of the Rings TCG was not renewed by Decipher, there was no legal way for the company to promote a World Championship, but they did still hold an unofficial event where the 2007 World Champions were crowned.  The event was still held in Indianapolis, IN at GenCon on Friday, August 17, 2007 at 11:00 AM.  The field was bested by Vince Accetturo and Chris Thompson, both members of the player group Team Bison Bucks.  They decided to split the championship in the finals.\n\n'''2010 World Championship'''\n\nWith no official governing body for the game existing after 2007, no official World Championships could be held. No group stepped up to attempt an unofficial World Championship event until 2010 when the [http://www.starwarsccg.org/ Star Wars CCG Players Committee] decided to run a de facto World Championship for Lord of the Rings at their annual Worlds Weekend event. Brian Fred was crowned champion as the only undefeated player at the event, in which close to 20 players participated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lotrtcgwiki.com/forums/index.php?topic=5072.30|title=LOTR Worlds Event 2010|website=lotrtcgwiki.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510114715/http://lotrtcgwiki.com/forums/index.php?topic=5072.30|archivedate=10 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Card Database ==\nA card database is maintained at [http://lotrtcgwiki.com lotrtcgwiki.com] by a fan, who had announced a commitment to keep the site running.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://decipher.fanhq.com/ Official Company Website]\n* [http://personal.inet.fi/koti/hannibal/lotr/LOTR_linkit.html  LOTR MAP system variant]\n* [http://lotrtcgdb.com/ Complete card list]\n\n{{LOTR}}\n{{Decipher, Inc.}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord Of The Rings Trading Card Game}}\n[[Category:Card games introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:Collectible card games]]\n[[Category:Games based on Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Origins Award winners]]\n[[Category:Decipher, Inc. games]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the trading card game by Decipher|collectible card game by Iron Crown Enterprises|Middle-earth Collectible Card Game}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Infobox game\n| subject_name= ''Lord of the Rings: Trading Card Game''\n|  image_link= File:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game cardback.jpg\n|  image_caption= Card back\n|  designer= Mike Reynolds, Chuck Kallenbach II, Tom Lischke, and Joe Alread\n|  publisher= [[Decipher, Inc.]]\n|  players= 2 or more\n|  setup_time= < 5 minutes\n|  playing_time= < 60 minutes\n|  random_chance= Some\n|  skills= [[Collectible card game|Card playing]]<br/>[[Mathematics|Arithmetic]]\n}}\n\n'''''The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game''''' (a.k.a.

However, since the game's print run has ended, sales for online cards have been stopped and the servers closed in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/|title=Default Parallels Plesk Panel Page|website=lotronline.decipher.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040304123936/http://lotronline.decipher.com/|archivedate=4 March 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Game concept==\n''The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game'' is a game for two or more players, each of who uses his or her own deck consisting of equal numbers of ''Free Peoples'' and ''Shadow'' cards, with a minimum of 30 of each. On a player's turn they are considered to be the Free Peoples player and their [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] and Free Peoples cards both in their Support Area and on their characters are ''active''. A player uses his Free Peoples cards to attempt to traverse the site-path and destroy the [[One Ring]] by reaching the ninth site. Each of his or her opponents, the Shadow Players, use their Shadow cards to prevent this by attempting to kill or corrupt the ring-bearer, or by forcing the Fellowship to slow down long enough for their Fellowship to race to victory. At the end of each turn the position of Free Peoples player rotates to the next player in turn. The game is won by the first Free Peoples player to survive to the ninth, and final, site or the last player whose Fellowship is left alive or when you corrupt the opposing fellowships ring-bearer.<ref name=\"DUMMIES\">{{cite book|title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|url=https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf|url-access=registration|series=For Dummies|last1=Kaufeld|first1=John|last2=Smith|first2=Jeremy|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2006|isbn=0470044071|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAn innovative mechanic called the ''twilight pool'' is used as a costing mechanism for cards. Each card has a numerical cost (which can be zero). When the Free Peoples player plays a card, tokens are added to the twilight pool equal to the cost of that card. The Shadow players, however, remove twilight tokens equal to the twilight cost of their cards in order to play their cards. Thus the more powerful cards the Fellowship the Free Peoples player plays, the greater the threat from the Shadow players. Each Free People and Shadow card belonged to a specific culture such as [[Gondor]], [[Gollum]] or [[Isengard]] with cards within a culture complimenting or even requiring one another, but players were free to construct their decks with a mix of cards from any culture.\n\nThroughout a game, a player will play ''companions'' (or Free People characters) to help defend the ring-bearer. When it is his turn to play as the Shadow player, he then can play ''minions'' (or Shadow characters) to attack the opponents companions. The Free People's player (the defender) has the opportunity to choose which of his companions will fight in one-to-one duels, called ''skirmishes'', with the opponents minions. This is called ''assignment''. Since the Free Peoples player wants to defend his ring-bearer, the only way a Shadow player can attack the Free Peoples player is by playing more minions than the Free Peoples player has companions, thus allowing the Shadow player to assign extra minions to any companion he chooses, including the ring-bearer, or by using minions whose game text allows the Shadow player to assign them to the ring-bearer. The character in a skirmish with less strength takes a wound, but if the total difference in strengh is double or higher, the losing character is killed immediately instead. Other types of cards are ''possessions'' that character can bear to gain additional bonuses, ''conditions'' that retain their effect until they are discarded and ''events'', which are discarded immediately after being used.\n\nHowever, the Ring-bearer does not only face minions on his journey to destroy the Ring. The Ring-bearer has to resist the temptation of the Ring. In the trading card game, when the ring-bearer succumbs to the temptation of the Ring, ''burdens'' are added and most versions of the [[One Ring]] enable the Ring-bearer to take burdens instead of impending wounds. Each companion has a given resistance stat, and whenever a burden is added, each companion's resistance is lowered by one. Once the ring-bearer's resistance reaches zero, he is corrupted by the power of the ring and the player is eliminated from the game.\n\n==Game sets and distribution==\nWhen the game's run had ended in mid-2007, nineteen sets in total had been released.  Three of expansions (''Expanded [[Middle-earth]] Deluxe Draft Box'', ''The Wraith Collection'', and ''[[Third Age|Age's End]]'') were not available in booster packs.\n\n===The movie years===\nFor the first three years the game's releases followed the movies. A 365 \"base set\" was released each November containing material from the upcoming movie. These were followed by two 122 card expansions at four-month intervals. Each base set and the following two expansions formed a \"block\" named for that base set.\n\nCards were sold in eleven card booster packs consisting of one rare, three uncommon and seven common cards. In approximately one in six packs a common was replaced by a foiled version of a random card from that set. Each set also had two sixty-three card [[Starter pack|starter decks]] containing two copies of a promotional face card, three random rares and sixty fixed commons/uncommons (sets 5 and 6 had sixty card starters with three alternate image rares in place of the random rares).\n\nBetween the second and third expansions of ''[[The Return of the King]]'' block an extra set, ''Reflections'', was released. This consisted of 52 new cards, all foiled, half of which were designated rare plus and half rare. The new cards took material from all three films and material produced by Weta specifically for the game and did not belong to any block. Reflections boosters contained two of the new cards (with one R+ every 2.4 packs) and sixteen repackaged random cards from the first six sets. One of these old cards was always non-English.\n\n===Shadows and beyond===\nIn November 2004 the new base set, ''Shadows'', marked an overhaul to the game. All sets would contain sixty rare, uncommon and common cards each in addition to varied amount of fixed cards, only available in Starter Decks.  Instead of foiling every card, each expansion would only have eighteen pre-selected rare foil cards that would be randomly inserted now into one in every seven booster packs. ''Shadows'' also had four, rather than two, different starter decks. The material used for the cards would also now cover the entire trilogy instead of being tied to the films' releases.\n\nAdditionally, a system of rotation was announced to be introduced to the game. Starting in March 2005 the entire ''Fellowship'' block ceased to be legal for use in the Standard tournament format. Then, each November the oldest block remaining will also be \"rotated out\". Decipher claimed this helped keep the card pool down to a manageable size and would keep established players buying new cards. Detractors claimed it was a money grab and didn't like being forced to purchase what they felt were inferior cards.\n\n===Set list===\nWhere two dates are listed, the first date refers to starter decks and the second to booster packs:\n\n# ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (November 6, 2001) - The first base set that introduced the core mechanics of the game. The cards were divided between [Dwarves], [Elves], [Gandalf], [Gondor] and [Shire] cultures on the Free People sides and [Isengard], [Moria], [Ringwraith] and [Sauron] cultures on the Shadow side. The set is notable for having the largest number of ''Ally'' type of cards, characters who did not travel with the Fellowship and only provided aid through special abilities. Each subsequent set would see fewer and fewer ''Ally'' cards released, until they were completely phased out.\n# ''Mines of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]'' (March 6 & 13, 2002) - The first game expansion introduces the ''Artifact'' type of cards, which functioned similarly to ''possessions'', but did not suffer penalties from cards directly targeting them. This expansion significantly boosted the [Dwarves] and [Moria] faction, most notably featuring the [[Balrog]], which posed a significant danger to the Free People at the unavoidable \"The Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm\" site.\n# ''Realms of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lords'' (June 19 & July 3, 2002) - This set significantly boosted the [Elves] and [Isengard] cultures by adding a large number of Elven allies, introducing Isengard [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]] in addition to the [[Uruk-hai]] and featuring the first playable versions of [[Saruman]].\n# ''[[The Two Towers]]'' (November 6, 2002) - The second base set brought the first significant overhaul of the game scene. The set contained no cards of [Moria], [Ringwraith] and [Sauron] cultures; instead new Shadow cultures of [Dunland] and [Raiders] (which combined the Southrons and the Easterlings) were added along with the [Rohan] Free People culture, and each culture now contained cards which could contain a number of that culture's tokens. The site path from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was completely replaced with the new sites from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'', and sites could now be controlled by Shadow Players and liberated by the Free Peoples.\n# ''[[Battle of Helm's Deep]]'' (March 12, 2003) - This set brought back the [Sauron] culture and also introduced the new [Gollum] culture, which reflecting the character's duality consisted of both Free People and Shadow cards, which could alternatively reinforce or combat one another.\n# ''[[Ent]]s of [[Fangorn forest|Fangorn]]'' (July 2, 2003) - This set brought back the [Ringwraith] culture and introduced new versions of the Ents which were more pro-active in combat than the previous versions, which had specific requirements to be allowed to skirmish. It also contained new cards of the [Moria] culture, including a version of the Balrog who could be played on sites other than ''Underground''.\n# ''[[The Return of the King]]'' (November 5, 2003) - In addition to completely replacing the site path once again, the third base set added the new mechanics of ''threats'' (tokens that had to be assigned as wounds when a companion or ally was killed) and ''initiative'', which either Free Peoples or Shadow player had based on the number of cards in their hands. This set contained no cards of [Dunland], [Isengard] and [Moria] cultures, but added [[Minas Morgul]] orcs to the previously [[Nazg\u00fbl]]-only [Ringwraith] culture.\n# ''Siege of [[Gondor]]'' (March 10, 2004) - This set significantly boosted the [Raiders] culture by enhancing it with the Corsairs of [[Umbar]] and added the Dead Men of Dunharrow to the [Gondor] culture. It also introduces [[Shelob]] as the only other minion for the [Gollum] culture and featured characters with the powerful keyword ''enduring'', who increased in strength after gaining each subsequent wound.\n# ''Reflections'' (May 12, 2004) - Released in between two expansions of ''The Return of the King'' block, this special set was the most innovative at the time. Characters from the Prologue of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' such as [[Elendil]] and [[Gil-Galad]] were introduced for the first time and characters from the books that were abscent from the movies such as [[Glorfindel]] and [[Tom Bombadil]] were added through the designs created by [[Weta Workshop]] speficially for the game. Most importantly, characters other than Frodo were allowed to be the Ringbearer for the first time, featuring versions of [[Galadriel]], [[Boromir]], [[Smeagol]] and others who could bear the [[One Ring]] instead. More alternative Ringbearers would be added in later sets.\n# ''[[Mount Doom]]'' (July 14, 2004) - The final set of the \"movie\" release era introduced new powerful versions of several characters such as [[\u00c9owyn]], [[Arwen]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] that would remain the preferred choices for many of the deck strategies.\n# ''Shadows'' (November 3, 2004) - The release of the new \"base set\" saw the most significant overhaul of the game, which would remain to be seen unfavorably by many players. Existing faction-based Shadow cultures of [Dunland] [Isengard], [Moria], [Raiders] and [Sauron] were replaced with more generic [Orcs], [Uruk-Hai] and [Evil Men], leaving only [Ringwraith] and [Gollum] unchanged and making the majority of the old cards incompatibe with the new cultures. Companions other than the Ring-Bearer now also had Resistance, which was affected by both Free People and Shadow cards. Most importantly, instead of a numbered site path based on an individual movie, the nine sites from all three films could now be played in any order and replaced continuously by both Free People and Shadow cards. While this allowed for new gameplay strategies, many felt that the core aspect of the game no longer made sense story-wise.\n# ''[[Ringwraith|Black Rider]]'' (March 18, 2005) - The first post-\"Shadows\" expansion was notable for reprinting many prominent cards from ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' block, which because of the recently introduced block rotation were no longer legal in the Standard tournament format.\n# ''Bloodlines'' (August 12, 2005) - This set introduced the new ''Follower'' card type - minor characters who could provide their ''Aid'' to the Fellowship for a cost that must be paid each turn. It also included the only cards that could change their card type in the form of conditions that could turn into minions and back.\n# ''Expanded [[Middle-earth]] Deluxe Draft Box'' (February 17, 2006) - Similar to \"Reflections\", this 15-card set used artwork by Weta Workshop to represent characters from the books not included in the films, such as [[Halbarad]], [[Grimbeorn]] and [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot|D\u00e1in Ironfoot]].\n# ''The Hunters'' (June 9, 2006) - Released after a significant delay due to the financial problems experienced by [[Decipher, Inc.]], this new base set introduced a new powerful keyword ''Hunter'' and doubled the amount of available Followers.\n# ''The Wraith Collection'' (August 26, 2006) - This Deluxe set had only six cards and consisted entirely of Minions of the [Ringwraith] culture, half of whom used artwork by Weta Workshop to represent the [[Barrow-wight]]s.\n# ''Rise of [[Saruman]]'' (March 1, 2007) - Released after another long delay, this set featured the only Free People character to be represented by more than one culture by introduing the [Rohan] version of [[Aragorn]]. It also contained no less than five different versions of [[Saruman]], one for each culture, including the only Shadow follower in the game.\n# ''Treachery and Deceit'' (May 2007) - Rushed to release before the impending expiration of the license, this set suffered from a lack of playtesting and contained the largest number of overpowered or \"broken\" cards, for which official [[Erratum|errata]] had to be released almost immediately. This set also received the smallest printing of all and remains incredibly hard to find in circulation.\n# ''[[Third Age|Age's End]]'' (June 2007) - Released mere weeks before Decipher's license expired, this final \"farewell\" set consisted of 40 Promo-rarity cards available in a single Deluxe box. It featured the final versions of many promiment characters, some of which have been noted to be the most powerful than any of those that came before.\n\nIn addition a number of boutique products have been released:\n*Oversized Cards (August 2001 - Summer 2003)\n*Promotional Cards (Spring 2002 - Summer 2007)\n*''The Fellowship of the Ring Anthology'' (July 23, 2003)\n*''The Two Towers Anthology'' (February 25, 2004)\n*''The Return of the King Anthology'' (September 2004)\n*''The War of the Ring Anthology'' (September 2005)\n\nThe seven-month delay of ''The Hunters'' expansion release (from November 2005 to June 2006) made the game suffer a significant drop in popularity amongst its players as well as eventually force Decipher Inc. to remove the expansions ''The Great Eye'' and ''Shelob's Lair'' from its intended expansion since Decipher's license for ''Lord of the Rings'' related material was scheduled to expire on June 30, 2007. Following the release of the final expansion ''Age's End'' in June 2007 the game was discontinued and Decipher was forced to stop all production, distribution, and advertising.\n\n==Deck strategies==\nAs the game expanded beyond the first base set, several basic deck strategies were identified and developed. As decks are separated into Shadow and Free People sides, the two sides are to some extent interchangeable, but the best decks usually contain some synergy between both types of cards. Later sets have introduced multiple additional keywords and mechanics and greatly increased the pool of available cards, massively expanding the possibilities for unique strategies, often depending on a specific card.\n\nFor the Free Peoples side, the common basic strategies are ''tank'', ''choke'', ''minion wounding'' and ''mass healing''.\n\n;Tank: Tank decks try to play as much as possible and build up as many companions to combat the opponents Shadow side with force.\n;Choke: Choke decks, the opposite of tank decks, try to put out as little twilight as possible, denying the opponent resources to play their minions, and clogging their hand with unplayable Shadow cards, thus hampering the set up of their Fellowship.\n;Archery/Wounding: Minion wounding decks try to use \"archery fire\" and direct wounding to destroy the minions before they even have a chance to attack.\n;Mass Healing: Mass healing decks rely on the cards that heal companions, with the expectation that if the Free People's removal of wounds can out-pace the Shadow player's placement of wounds, the Fellowship will be unkillable.\n\nFor the Shadow side, the common basic strategies are ''beat-down'', ''swarm'', ''bomb'', '' companion wounding'' and ''corruption''.\n\n;Beat-down: Beat down decks focus on making one or two minions very powerful with big damage bonuses, with the intention of killing all of the companions one by one; eventually killing the ring-bearer.\n;Swarm: Swarm decks have an opposite strategy of a beat-down: their goal is to play as many minions as possible as cheaply as possible. While one swarm minion might not be very powerful by itself, each minion is very cheap which allows many to be played, easily outnumbering the companions and assigning themselves to the Ring-bearer.\n;Bomb: A bomb deck combines the strategies of both beat-down decks and swarm decks. Instead of focusing on one or two powerful minions, they play several minions of medium strength. The goal of a bomb deck is to destroy the weaker companions, and then swarm the Free Peoples player.\n;Archery/Wounding: Archery and wounding decks rely on wounding companions outside of the skirmish so much that they die from their wounds. A variation of this strategy focuses on wounding the ring-bearer and killing him.\n;Corruption: Corruption decks focus on adding enough burdens to corrupt the ring-bearer, or playing cards that require certain conditions to be met to corrupt the ring-bearer outright.\n\n;Discard: Used by both Free People and Shadow sides, discard decks focus on discarding cards from either your opponent's hand or their draw deck, disrupting their strategy and eventually leaving them with no cards to oppose you in later turns.\n\n==Lord of the Rings Online TCG==\nIn 2003 [https://web.archive.org/web/20051224162205/http://www.worlds-apart.com/ Worlds Apart] partnered with Decipher to produce [http://lotronline.decipher.com/ an online version of the Lord of the Rings TCG].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/news/press_archive.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315132734/http://lotronline.decipher.com/news/press_archive.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-15 }}</ref> The online game's rules matched the physical games rules, but utilized tradeable virtual cards that could be purchased through the system via starter decks, booster packs, or in draft. In addition to casual play, the online LOTR TCG system supported tournament play, league play, and sealed play including draft. The online system introduced a number of cards and formats that were online-only (for example, King-block draft packs), and offered players exclusive physical promotional cards and online avatars and movement tokens for participating in online events. The LOTR Online TCG software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/download/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004050120/http://lotronline.decipher.com/download/ |archivedate=2009-10-04 }}</ref> included collection management and robust deckbuilding features. For this reason alone many players have used the software to construct decks and print decklists.\n\nIn 2005 Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) bought Worlds Apart, but continued to support LOTR Online TCG. On May 22, 2007 SOE-Decipher announced the closure of all support for the Online gaming system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lotronline.decipher.com/|title=Default Parallels Plesk Panel Page|website=lotronline.decipher.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040304123936/http://lotronline.decipher.com/|archivedate=4 March 2004}}</ref> The LOTR Online TCG software was available and the SOE servers ran until June 30, 2010 when they were shut down for good, though no new cards could be purchased after May, 2007.\n\nThough not sanctioned or approved by Decipher, various alternate ways to play the game online have at various points been developed by players.\n\n==Pro Tour Events==\nIn July 2002, the first pro tour event was held at Origins Game Fair in Columbus, Ohio and it was won by John Lolli. 212 players participated in the event, and first place was $2,500. Christopher Schaut finished in 2nd place winning $1,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decktech.net/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3842&view=2|title=Welcome Lord of the Rings Players|date=30 August 2005|website=archive.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830191851/http://www.decktech.net/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3842&view=2|archivedate=30 August 2005}}</ref> Lolli used a unique deck designed to pass the ring from Frodo to Sam, and deny twilight to its opponent. Almost all of the top players were using later banned card called The Mirror of Galadriel, and Lolli used that strategy against his opponents designing a Minion half of the deck to counteract it.\n\n==Organized play==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Former World Champions include:\n!

Since the rights to produce the Lord of the Rings TCG was not renewed by Decipher, there was no legal way for the company to promote a World Championship, but they did still hold an unofficial event where the 2007 World Champions were crowned.  The event was still held in Indianapolis, IN at GenCon on Friday, August 17, 2007 at 11:00 AM.  The field was bested by Vince Accetturo and Chris Thompson, both members of the player group Team Bison Bucks.  They decided to split the championship in the finals.\n\n'''2010 World Championship'''\n\nWith no official governing body for the game existing after 2007, no official World Championships could be held.

During the dry season, the average water depth is {{convert|7|ft|m}}, with the deepest point being {{convert|12|ft|m}}, but during the [[monsoon|rainy season]] this can increase by {{convert|5|ft|m}}.\n\nThe watershed area for the lake lies to a large extent to the north and west of the lake. The lake drains through the Nam Pilu or Balu Chaung on its southern end. There is also a hot spring on its northwestern shore.\n\nAlthough the lake is not large, it contains a number of endemic species. Over twenty species of snails and nine species of fish are found nowhere else in the world. Some of these, like the silver-blue scaleless [[Sawbwa (fish)|Sawbwa barb]], the [[Danio erythromicron|crossbanded dwarf danio]], and the [[Devario auropurpureus|Lake Inle danio]], are of minor commercial importance for the aquarium trade.

The entire lake area is in [[Nyaung Shwe]] township. The population consists predominantly of [[Intha people|Intha]], with a mix of other [[Shan people|Shan]], Taungyo, [[Pa-O]] (Taungthu), [[Danu people|Danu]], Kayah, Danaw and [[Bamar]] ethnicities. Most are devout [[Buddhists]], and live in simple houses of wood and woven [[bamboo]] on stilts; they are largely [[Subsistence|self-sufficient]] farmers.\n\nTransportation on the lake is traditionally by small boats, or by somewhat larger boats fitted with single cylinder inboard diesel engines. Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and wrapping the other leg around the oar. This unique style evolved out of necessity as the lake is covered by reeds and floating plants, making it difficult to see above them while sitting. Standing provides the rower with a view beyond the reeds. However, the leg rowing style is only practiced by the men. Women row in the customary style, using the oar with their hands, sitting cross legged at the stern.\n\nFish caught from the lake - the most abundant kind is called ''nga hpein'' locally (Inle carp, ''[[Cyprinus intha]]'') - are a staple of the local diet.

The Shan-bags, used daily by many Burmese as a tote-bag, are produced in large quantities here. Silk-weaving is another very important industry, producing high-quality hand-woven silk fabrics of distinctive design called Inle [[longyi]].

During the dry season, the average water depth is {{convert|7|ft|m}}, with the deepest point being {{convert|12|ft|m}}, but during the [[monsoon|rainy season]] this can increase by {{convert|5|ft|m}}.\n\nThe watershed area for the lake lies to a large extent to the north and west of the lake. The lake drains through the Nam Pilu or Balu Chaung on its southern end. There is also a hot spring on its northwestern shore.\n\nAlthough the lake is not large, it contains a number of endemic species. Over twenty species of snails and nine species of fish are found nowhere else in the world. Some of these, like the silver-blue scaleless [[Sawbwa (fish)|Sawbwa barb]], the [[Danio erythromicron|crossbanded dwarf danio]], and the [[Devario auropurpureus|Lake Inle danio]], are of minor commercial importance for the aquarium trade.

The entire lake area is in [[Nyaung Shwe]] township. The population consists predominantly of [[Intha people|Intha]], with a mix of other [[Shan people|Shan]], Taungyo, [[Pa-O]] (Taungthu), [[Danu people|Danu]], Kayah, Danaw and [[Bamar]] ethnicities. Most are devout [[Buddhists]], and live in simple houses of wood and woven [[bamboo]] on stilts; they are largely [[Subsistence|self-sufficient]] farmers.\n\nTransportation on the lake is traditionally by small boats, or by somewhat larger boats fitted with single cylinder inboard diesel engines. Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and wrapping the other leg around the oar. This unique style evolved out of necessity as the lake is covered by reeds and floating plants, making it difficult to see above them while sitting. Standing provides the rower with a view beyond the reeds. However, the leg rowing style is only practiced by the men. Women row in the customary style, using the oar with their hands, sitting cross legged at the stern.\n\nFish caught from the lake - the most abundant kind is called ''nga hpein'' locally (Inle carp, ''[[Cyprinus intha]]'') - are a staple of the local diet. A popular local dish is ''htamin gyin'' - 'fermented' rice kneaded with fish and/or potato - served with ''hnapyan gyaw'' (literally twice fried - [[Burmese tofu|Shan tofu]]).

Typical products include tools, carvings and other ornamental objects, textiles, and [[cheroot]]s. A local market serves most common shopping needs and is held daily but the location of the event rotates through five different sites around the lake area, thus each of them hosting an itinerant market every fifth day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journeysmyanmar.com/5_days_market.htm|title=Fifth day markets|publisher=JourneysMyanmar|accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> When held on the lake itself, trading is conducted from small boats. This 'floating-market' event tends to emphasize tourist trade much more than the other four.\n\nThe Inle lake area is renowned for its weaving industry. The Shan-bags, used daily by many Burmese as a tote-bag, are produced in large quantities here. Silk-weaving is another very important industry, producing high-quality hand-woven silk fabrics of distinctive design called Inle [[longyi]]. A unique fabric from the lotus plant fibers is produced only at Inle lake and is used for weaving special robes for [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images called ''kya thingahn'' (lotus robe).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myanmartravelinformation.com/mti-myanmar-culture/lotus-robe.htm|title=The Elegant and Sacred Lotus Robe|year=2006|publisher=Myanmar Travel Information|accessdate=2007-02-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218031538/http://myanmartravelinformation.com/mti-myanmar-culture/lotus-robe.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2006-12-18}}</ref>\n\nWhile hot air balloon flights are more popular in [[Bagan]], they are also provided over Inle Lake with Balloons Over Bagan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balloonsoverbagan.com/|title=Balloons Over Bagan the Pioneer in Myanmar by Memories Group|website=www.balloonsoverbagan.com}}</ref>  There is also a winery near the lake, called Red Mountain Estate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.redmountain-estate.com/|title=Red Mountain Estate Vineyards & Winery|website=www.redmountain-estate.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onceinalifetimejourney.com/once-in-a-lifetime-journeys/ultimate-guide-inle-lake/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Inle Lake|last=Once in a Lifetime Journey|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:Inle dish.jpg|thumb|thumb|''Htamin jin'' (fermented rice) served with ''hnapyan jaw'' (twice-fried Shan tofu) is a popular local dish.]]\n\nInle cuisine is different from Shan cuisine, as it incorporates local natural produce.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Tall Girls Productions, with [[Melissa Rosenberg]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Krysten Ritter]] stars as Jones, while [[David Tennant]] plays Kilgrave. The two are joined by principal cast members [[Mike Colter]], [[Rachael Taylor]], [[Wil Traval]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], [[Eka Darville]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]. ''Jessica Jones'' entered development in late 2013, with Rosenberg reworking a series she had previously developed for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014, and production took place in New York City from February to August 2015. The season addresses issues of rape and assault, and was always intended to be far more \"adult\" than other Marvel projects, particularly in terms of sex. The show's cinematography took inspiration from [[Neo-noir|noir]], while visual effects house Shade VFX focused on creating \"invisible\" effects that would support its realistic approach.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in New York City on November 17, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on November 20 to an estimated high viewership and critical acclaim. Critics praised the performances of Ritter and Tennant, as well as the season's noir tone, approach to sexuality, and coverage of darker topics such as rape, assault and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. The season was awarded a [[Peabody Award]] in the category of \"Entertainment and Children's programs\", and a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation#Short Form|short form dramas]]. A [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]] of ''Jessica Jones'' was ordered on January 17, 2016.<ref name=\"S2Order\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A498D |overall=5 |season=5 |title=29 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-jessica-jones/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's jessica jones on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = AKA Ladies Night\n |DirectedBy      = [[S.

While not working, Jones spies on [[Luke Cage]], a bar owner who sees her looking into his bar and offers her free alcohol as a \"Ladies Night\" promotion, leading to the two sleeping together. She leaves upset after seeing a photo of a woman in his bathroom. Jones is approached by Barbara and Bob Shlottman after their daughter Hope began acting differently and disappeared. Jones discovers that Hope is with [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]], a man with mind control abilities who once controlled Jones, leaving her with [[PTSD]], and whom she believed was dead. Jones wants to flee, but is convinced by her friend and foster-sister [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]] to help Hope.

Jones lies to Cage that she had been hired by the husband of a woman who Cage had slept with. Cage, having not known that the woman was married, confronts the woman about it, and when she goes to her husband, he attacks Cage with a group. Jones helps fight off the men, and learns that Cage is gifted with unbreakable skin. Hogarth agrees to represent Shlottman if Jones can prove that Kilgrave exists. Jones remembers leaving Kilgrave to die after he was hit by a bus, and now tracks down the ambulance driver who had picked him up. The driver had donated both his kidneys to Kilgrave, and is now on dialysis. Jones finds the operating doctor who anonymously donated the dialysis machine. He agrees to testify for Shlottman, and reveals that he operated on Kilgrave without anesthesia since that would have blocked Kilgrave's abilities.

Hogarth, now divorcing Wendy (who discovered the affair) and unwilling to risk herself and her reputation despite Wendy's testimony, organizes for Walker to interview Shlottman about Kilgrave live on her radio talk show. Walker asks that anyone who believes they have been approached or controlled by Kilgrave contact Hogarth, and then publicly insults Kilgrave on air. Angered, Kilgrave sends police sergeant Will Simpson to kill Walker, with Jones having to use the anesthetic on Walker to convince Simpson that he has carried out his orders. Jones follows Simpson back to Kilgrave, who orders Simpson to walk off a balcony. Jones again convinces Simpson that he has carried out this order by knocking him out and taking him to the street below, telling him as he wakes that she caught him.

Jones tracks Eastman's husband to a rendezvous with his girlfriend only to discover a trap set by Eastman, who blames gifted people for the death of her mother during \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\" and who learned of Jones' powers from Spheeris. Angered as she recalls the death of her own parents, Jones convinces the Eastmans to leave her alone with a show of her power and a bluff over the number of other gifted in the city. Hogarth and Jones process a large number of people claiming to have been controlled by Kilgrave, forming a support group for those legitimately affected by him. Simpson attempts to apologize to a frightened Walker over his action while under Kilgrave's control; they eventually bond over the experience. Jones uses surveillance footage provided by Simpson and clues offered by the Kilgrave support group to learn that the photographer spying on her for Kilgrave is her drug addicted neighbor [[Malcolm Ducasse]]. \n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = AKA The Sandwich Saved Me\n |DirectedBy      = [[Stephen Surjik]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dana Baratta\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones recalls her brief time as a superhero as she debates whether to save Ducasse or to use him as a means of locating Kilgrave. Walker and Simpson begin a romantic relationship with Jones grudgingly allowing him to assist in a plot to capture Kilgrave. Simpson supplies ex-special operations skills and contacts, including access to a hermetically sealed room in which Kilgrave could be kept once the effects of the anesthetic wear off. They follow Ducasse to his daily meeting with Kilgrave where photographs of Jones are exchanged for drugs, which Kilgrave had forced Ducasse to become addicted to so he would obey Kilgrave even after his powers wore off, after around 12 hours of no contact. Simpson shoots Kilgrave with the anesthetic; Jones refuses to let him kill Kilgrave so he can be used to prove Shlottman innocent. Jones gets Kilgrave to Walker and the getaway car, but they are attacked by hired bodyguards who escape with the unconscious Kilgrave.

After paying a fellow inmate to beat her, Shlottman confesses to Jones that she is pregnant with Kilgrave's child and has been trying to miscarry. Jones gives her an abortion pill; Hogarth secretly takes the fetal remains. Cage hires Jones to help find the brother of someone, who has evidence on the death of Cage's wife [[Reva Connors]]. Connors had left Cage instructions to find a box she had hidden, but it was not there when he looked. Jones recalls Kilgrave having Connors lead them to the box, with Jones digging it up before killing Connors. Jones and Cage find the missing brother, and are given the file of the bus driver that accidentally hit Kilgrave (and who Cage believes hit Connors). Seeing that the driver had been drunk, Cage seeks revenge. Jones intervenes and confesses that Kilgrave forced her to kill Connors.

Wendy refuses to sign the papers. Ducasse helps Jones back to her apartment, where they find her neighbor Ruben, dead. Knowingly blaming Kilgrave, Jones devises a desperate plan: get herself imprisoned in a [[supermax prison]] so when Kilgrave inevitably comes for her, his abilities will be caught on camera. Walker and Simpson have their own plan, with Simpson following Kilgrave's security detail, though he does not tell Walker when he finds them at Jones's old house. Ducasse disposes of Ruben's body, though Jones finds him. Enacting her plan, Jones goes to a police station with Ruben's severed head and confesses to his murder. Her processing is interrupted when Kilgrave takes control of the station and declares his love for Jones, as she was the first person to resist him.

Though he takes her phone so she cannot record him, she secretly gets Simpson's when she catches him sneaking into the house to plant a bomb. Not willing to let Kilgrave die until Shlottman is free, Jones tells Kilgrave about the bomb. Kilgrave, in an effort to prove that his nature was forced upon him, shows Jones a pendrive (which Connors had hidden in the box) containing footage of his parents experimenting on him as a child, and him eventually stopping them by his command. Jones shows Kilgrave that he can do good with his powers by convincing him to save several people. She visits Walker and asks whether she should stay with Kilgrave and try to use his abilities to change the world for good. When Jones, knowing that Kilgrave will harm some of his \"servants\" if she does not return, goes back to Kilgrave, she instead uses a distraction to incapacitate him, and flies away with him.

Kozlov gives him some pills, and his injuries heal miraculously. Jones imprisons Kilgrave in the hermetically sealed room, where she plans to torture him until he reveals his abilities on camera. Hogarth warns her that this would forfeit their case in court, and that the D.A. has offered a 20 year plea deal to Shlottman if she pleads guilty. Jones convinces Shlottman to not take the deal, and devises a new plan. From the footage of Kilgrave's experiments, Jones discovers the names of his parents, Louise and Albert Thompson, and from photographs realizes that his mother is a member of the support group. Jones confronts her and Albert, and convinces them to face their son. Jones also forces Clemons to act as a witness. In the cell, Kilgrave is remorseful, but Louise attempts to kill him to stop him from hurting anyone again, and he makes her kill herself.

Pam arrives, and accidentally kills Wendy to stop her by hitting her in the head with a [[vase]]. Thompson reveals that Kilgrave's abilities are a virus that he releases, and that a vaccine could be created from Jones's blood as Jones appears to have become immune to Kilgrave's influence. Simpson, under the influence of Kozlov's drugs (that enhance combat performance and numb pain) arrives at the cell, where Clemons is guarding the evidence needed to imprison Kilgrave. Set on killing Kilgrave instead, Simpson kills Clemons and destroys the evidence. He finds Walker with Thompson, who is unsuccessful in creating the vaccine, but she sends Simpson away when she sees how unstable he is, managing to take some of his pills from him in the process.

Affected by an increasing lack of sleep, Jones is injured in an accident, but does manage to find Clemons' body and deduces that Simpson killed him rather than Kilgrave. She agrees to meet with Simpson, and he attacks her in her apartment, overpowering the injured Jones. Walker arrives and uses Simpson's pills to help Jones defeat him. Not used to the pills, Walker requires medical attention.

After Cage recounts the events leading up to the explosion, in which he followed Jones to confront Kilgrave, they realize that Kilgrave is keeping Thompson alive to try and boost his abilities, and may be testing his increasing hold over people. While they investigate, Cage forgives Jones for her role in Connors' death, and the two begin to grow close again. They find a nightclub where Kilgrave tested his enhanced powers, and are confronted by him there. He reveals that he has been controlling Cage the whole time, having made him forgive Jones to earn her trust, and now unleashes Cage on Jones, escaping while they fight.

Thompson has been using the fetal remains that Hogarth kept, and believes that a full dose of his extracted drug could now make Kilgrave powerful enough to control Jones. Using Cage's phone, Jones tracks Kilgrave to the apartment of a wealthy couple, whom he has enslaved, in time to see Thompson die. Cage awakens, and decides to leave. Jones confronts Kilgrave at the couple's yacht, where he takes Walker hostage. When Jones allows this, Kilgrave believes that he finally has control over her again. However, when he tells her to say \"I love you\", Jones says it to Walker instead, and snaps Kilgrave's neck.

How am I going to get through this day?'\" He also added that inspiration for the season came from \"the noir films from the '40s\" and \"film[s] like ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" />\n\nDescribing the tone of the season, Loeb said, \"When we first started talking about ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a psychological thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that's a very powerful, emotional place to start from.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called \"lazy storytelling\" and often a way to \"spice up\" male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an \"issue\" for the season to tackle.<ref name=\"RosenbergHRNov2015\" /> When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity and the use of the word 'fuck' in the season.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\", Rosenberg said, \"It was never our intention going in [to hit a social issue], and I think the minute you intend to do that, you're stepping up on a soap box. If you're digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you're going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you're also going to hit social issues.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Krysten Ritter]] as [[Jessica Jones]],<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]],<ref name=\"Colter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]],<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> [[Wil Traval]] as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Hope Shlottman,<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Eka Darville]] as [[Malcolm Ducasse]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /> [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]],<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"Moss2\" /> and [[David Tennant]] as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"Tennant\" />\n\nAppearing in recurring roles for the season are Susie Abromeit as Pam,<ref name=\"Abromeit\" /> Colby Minifie and Kieran Mulcare as Robyn and Ruben,<ref name=\"MinifieMulcare\" /> Nichole Yannetty as Nicole,<ref name=\"Ep3Cite\" /> [[Clarke Peters]] as Oscar Clemons,<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Michael Siberry]] and [[Lisa Emery]] as Albert and Louise Thompson,<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" /> and [[Robin Weigert]] as Wendy Ross-Hogarth.<ref name=\"Weigert\" /> [[Danielle Ferland]], Gillian Glasco, Ryan Farrell, and Paul Pryce also recur as victims of Kilgrave who join a support group established by Jones,<ref name=\"Supporters\" /> while [[Rosario Dawson]] and Royce Johnson reprise their roles of [[Claire Temple]] and Brett Mahoney, respectively, from ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DawsonJJ\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky returned as the costume designer for ''Jessica Jones'' from ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> and was assisted on the first episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots costume.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> On Jones's costume, Maslansky said she \"considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way.\" At least 10 versions of Jones's jacket were made, which started as an [[Acne Studios]] leather motorcycle jacket that had any \"bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details\" removed. 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nBecause Jones's costume does not evolve much throughout the season, Maslansky used flashbacks to show how her costume had evolved to the present day: for 'pre-Kilgrave' Jessica Jones, Maslansky gave the character \"more pulled together\" clothes, albeit \"still kind of edgy\" clothes that did not change who she was as a character, but were just \"different\". For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead \"wear[s] her jeans and find[s] a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, maybe something that she borrowed from Trish\". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a \"variety\" of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to \"look dirty and old\"; \"a mere shadow of its former sandwich self,\" becoming \"more of a hoagie than a sandwich.\" In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's real situation, with Maslansky calling it \"so beautiful and so free and so light\".<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\nFor Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits created by designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], rather than custom-making them as she originally planned, as Smith \"was {{em|all}} about purple\" in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers \"wanted to find a place where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally \"fairly friendly color, and he's anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" /> Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone \"who wears his clothing like an armor,\" with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> For a character like Trish Walker, who does not have the same kind of \"statement costume\" as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so \"even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of [[rag & bone]] jeans with a [[Chlo\u00e9]] top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans.\" Maslansky added that Robin was \"a blast to dress\" because of her \"quirky\" personality, yet she was still able to \"put herself together aesthetically.\" For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming \"a little brighter and a little more hopeful.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Jessica Jones'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April, Marvel Comics' [[Editor in chief|editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] stated that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> The season went into production in February 2015 in [[The Bronx]] at [[Lehman College]] with the [[working title]] ''Violet'',<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBronx\" /> and aimed to film each episode over nine days, on average.<ref name=\"Billeter\" /> Filming concluded in mid-late August.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Other filming locations in New York City used included the East Village's Horseshoe Bar for Luke's Bar; the [[33rd Street (PATH station)|33rd Street PATH station]] and a [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]] train; the 101st Street area for the exterior of Jessica's apartment (with the interior apartment settings created on a sound stage); [[Douglaston, Queens]] for Jessica's childhood home; the [[Angel Orensanz Center]] for Jessica and Luke's fight in \"[[AKA Take a Bloody Number]]\"; [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]] and Pier 88 for locations in \"[[AKA Smile]]\";<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]]; [[Nolita]]; near the 39th Street entrance to the [[Lincoln Tunnel]]; [[Tribeca]]; [[Bryant Park]]; [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]; [[Gramercy Park|Gramercy]]; [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]] near the [[Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant]]; [[Long Island City]], including the Allied Extruder Factory for the weed growing facility, with exteriors shots taken from near [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]]; the [[Queensboro Bridge]] on the Queens side; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain]] in [[Central Park]]; and [[Industry City]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\nConcerning inspirations on the season, Loeb revealed that \"''Chinatown''... is one of the things that influenced [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Michael Gaydos]] when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone's in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they're having a conversation, that's the stuff that makes it interesting.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director [[S. J. Clarkson]] took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of [[Wong Kar-wai]] as reference to create \"unconventional\" compositions, with Billeter explaining, \"There were a lot of foreground elements [and] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia.\" Billeter shot the season with a [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company#Red Dragon|Red Epic Dragon]] camera in [[4K resolution]], with [[5K resolution|5K]] used for some visual effects shots, and with [[Panavision]] PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and \"good composition\", but did occasionally employ a [[camera dolly]] or [[steadicam]]. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s to [[LED]]s, so he tried to recreate the \"warm, dirty color of sodium vapor\" for night exterior scenes.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nProduction designer Loren Weeks described Marvel's Hell's Kitchen as having \"a little more [[East Village, Manhattan|[East] Village]] quality.\"<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> To achieve the explosion at Luke's Bar, Weeks said, \"We could not take out the windows [at Horseshoe Bar], which are [made up of] multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We didn't know frankly when we picked that location that we would have that explosion... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects.\" For the scenes on the PATH train and station, location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nShade VFX created over 600 effects shots for the season, with \"invisible\" effects \"the showpiece, helping to push forward the darker elements the series.\" Therefore, effects supervisor Karl Coyner and producer Julie Long worked closely with the crew on set to \"execute stunts, set extensions, explosions, wetwork and fire sequences\" while filming, rather than have Shade create those effects digitally.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXShots\" /> An effect that Shade was required to create was tinting Kilgrave's skin purple \"in a few key scenes\" where he is using his powers, a nod to the comic iteration's purple-skinned appearance.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXPurple\" />\n\n===Music===\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, [[Sean Callery]] revealed he was composing music for ''Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"CalleryComposer\" /> eventually stating that the music required for each episode ranged from 9 to 20 minutes, totaling approximately 415 minutes of music for the season.<ref name=\"CalleryVariety\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on June 3, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\nAll music composed by Sean Callery, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 59:53\n\n| title1          = Jessica Jones Main Title\n| length1         = 1:09\n\n| title2          = Then There's the Matter of You\n| length2         = 1:18\n\n| title3          = Fire Escape Night Shift\n| length3         = 4:16\n\n| title4          = Alias Investigations\n| length4         = 2:28\n\n| title5          = Fight at Luke's Bar\n| length5         = 2:21\n\n| title6          = Nurse Jessica\n| length6         = 2:13\n\n| title7          = Rescuing Hope from the Hotel Bed\n| length7         = 3:50\n\n| title8          = Kidnapping Kilgrave\n| length8         = 3:20\n\n| title9          = Sleepover at Luke's\n| length9         = 3:03\n\n| title10         = Jessica on the Move\n| length10        = 2:44\n\n| title11         = Cockroach\n| length11        = 3:09\n\n| title12         = Luke's Revenge on the Bus Driver\n| music12     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length12        = 2:31\n\n| title13         = Elevator Massacre\n| length13        = 2:52\n\n| title14         = Looking for Kilgrave\u2013Bus Accident Vision\n| length14        = 1:56\n\n| title15         = Hospital Cat and Mouse\n| length15        = 3:11\n\n| title16         = Gift from Trish\n| length16        = 2:55\n\n| title17         = Kilgrave Escapes His Glass Prison\n| length17        = 1:41\n\n| title18         = Tailing Malcolm\n| length18        = 2:22\n\n| title19         = Jessica Confesses to Luke\n| music19     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length19        = 2:58\n\n| title20         = Restaurant Flashback\n| length20        = 1:48\n\n| title21         = Jones\u2013Cage Match\n| music21     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length21        = 2:58\n\n| title22         = Final Justice for the Purple Man\n| length22        = 2:33\n\n| title23         = Maybe It's Enough the World Thinks I'm a Hero\n| length23        = 2:17\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nOn existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, \"''Jessica Jones'' is a very, very different show than ''Daredevil''. We exist in a cinematic universe, [and] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they're very different\u2026 That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into ''Daredevil'' or what's come before? And the answer is no.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" /> On references or \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" in the season, Rosenberg explained that \"A little is always there and in the writer's room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they're all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [''Alias'' comic].\" She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a \"little something in it.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" />\n\nJeryn Hogarth is closely associated with [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in the comics, and also worked with Luke Cage as part of those characters' ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' team.<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Like ''Daredevil'', the season makes references to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and the Avengers (specifically Hulk and Captain America, though not by name).<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> Jessica also mentions [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|Angela del Toro]] as another private investigator,<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K'un-Lun and Iron Fist.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> Paul Tassi, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', was disappointed with how the season fit into the larger MCU, feeling the season seemed \"removed from the world of ''The Avengers''\" and did not acknowledge ''Daredevil'' enough given that \"it's supposed to be sharing at least this little {{em|corner}} of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it.\"<ref name=\"ForbesMCUConnection\" /> Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that ''Jessica Jones''{{'}}s lack of overt connections to the MCU was \"the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, ''Jessica Jones'' also proves the MCU's thematic durability.\"<ref name=\"InverseJJ\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Jessica Jones'' was released on November 20, 2015, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> In January 2015, a month after Marvel announced a 2015 release for the season,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> Sarandos had said that it was \"too hard to say now\" if the season would actually release in 2015, with Netflix's plan to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after ''Daredevil''{{'}}s April 2015 release.<ref name=\"NetflixReleasePlans\" /> However, Netflix soon confirmed that the season would indeed release in 2015,<ref name=\"NetflixReleaseConfirm\" /> announcing the November 20 release date in September.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nIn May 2015, Marvel announced plans to reprint ''Alias'', the comic that the series is based on, with new covers from [[David W. Mack|David Mack]], the original cover artist on the comic who is also providing artwork for the series' opening credits. The reprints, which were all released digitally in June 2015, and up to issue 15 in two trade paperbacks in September, were intended to both celebrate the history of Jessica Jones, and introduce new audiences to the character ahead of the release of the season.<ref name=\"AliasReprint\" /> In late September through early October, Marvel and Netflix released short teasers for the season, which chronicled a day of Jones' life.<ref name=\"Teasers1\" /><ref name=\"Teasers2\" /> Also in early October, Marvel digitally released a 12-page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic by the original ''Alias'' creative team\u2014Bendis, Gaydos, and Mack\u2014set in the universe of the television series.<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> The one-shot was created as an exclusive for [[New York Comic Con]], where a print version was distributed.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|The comic]] sees Jessica Jones coming into contact with ''Daredevil'' character [[Turk Barrett]], and includes a short sequence featuring Daredevil,<ref name=\"OneShot\" /> to celebrate \"the connective tissue that will build between the series.\"<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> Also during New York Comic Con, Marvel set up a [[street marketing]] campaign, and screened \"[[AKA Ladies Night]]\" on October 10, while at the Marvel Booth fans could take their picture with the Alias Investigations desk, with Kilgrave's eyes appearing in the background of the final animation.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> Marvel additionally partnered with [[Uber]] during the event to provide select riders with complimentary trips to or from the convention in custom designed SUVs.<ref name=\"NYCCUber\" />\n\nA full trailer was released at the end of October, with Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] feeling that it helped establish the same tone as ''Daredevil'' and introduced \"Marvel's creepiest villain yet\" with Kilgrave. She also compared Jessica to some of the other female characters of the MCU\u2014[[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Melinda May]], and [[Peggy Carter]]\u2014feeling that Jessica stood out from the others because she does not have \"a sense of togetherness\" and was the most relatable because of her struggle with trauma, and that the season would have the amount of creative space required to explore the character that the other female characters were lacking.<ref name=\"CBRTrailer\" /> A second trailer was released on November 10, 2015. Sarene Leeds of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' felt that this trailer highlighted empowerment, compared to the first that \"was about illustrating the fear behind Jones's past\".<ref name=\"WSJTrailer2\" /> The season held its premiere in New York City on November 17.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on August 22, 2017,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on December 5, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on a sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, from September to December 2015, episodes of ''Jessica Jones'' averaged 4.8 million viewers during a 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel, [[NBCUniversal]] president of research and media development, in a presentation aimed to provide \"perspective\" when stating \"digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business\".<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers\" /> Netflix CCO [[Ted Sarandos]] responded to the data by saying that \"the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn't reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of.\"<ref name=\"NetflixViewersResponse\" /> A further study from Symphony, for the same time period, found ''Jessica Jones'' to be one of the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic, ahead of any broadcast network series.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers2\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 26% of the viewers that the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align             = left\n | width             = 150\n | direction         = vertical\n | footer          = Krysten Ritter (top) and David Tennant (bottom) received near universal praise for their portrayals of Jessica Jones and Kilgrave, respectively, with Ritter able to \"display her impressive range\" to give \"an exceptional performance\", and Tennant being called \"a horrific joy to behold\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesReview\" />\n <!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Krysten Ritter 2011.jpg\n | width1            = \n | alt1              = \n <!--image 2-->\n | image2            = 2009 07 31 David Tennant smile 09.jpg\n | width2            = \n | alt2              = \n}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 94% approval rating with an average rating of 8.24/10 based on 80 reviews.

He concluded by applauding the season's bringing up of the topics of [[rape]] and PTSD.<ref name=\"VulturePilotSexuality\" />\n\nReviewing the first seven episodes of the season, Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave positive thoughts on ''Jessica Jones'', stating, \"The show, which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure-handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, is not just a contender for the title Best Marvel-related TV property; in a supremely crowded TV scene, it is one of the year's most distinctive new dramas.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Jack Shepard of ''[[The Independent]]'', also on the first seven episodes, felt the season \"not only matches [''Daredevil''] but exceeds expectations.\" Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant's Kilgrave, feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel, and possibly \"the best on-screen comic book villain since [[Heath Ledger]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\"<ref name=\"IndependentReview\" /> ''Forbes''{{'}} Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes, \"the answer is a resounding yes\" if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television, claiming, \"In no uncertain terms, ''Jessica Jones'' is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced.

Though Maerz felt Ritter was a good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography, she felt the season \"could've made for a gritty character drama if it weren't for the noir clich\u00e9s (saxophone music, shadows through glass) and a procedural structure that's very ''CSI: Marvel''. The show's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica's: It starts out with extraordinary potential, but somewhere along the way, it loses what make it special.\"<ref name=\"EWReview\" />\n\nGoldman, later reviewing the whole season, gave it a 9.3 out of 10. He commended all the actors, the relationship between Jessica and Trish, and the episode \"Sin Bin\", though was critical of the character Robyn. Additionally, Goldman also felt the season spent \"too many scenes devoted to Jeri's marital strife\" and that it hit its peak \"a bit before the actual end of the season\" similar to ''Daredevil'', with most of the thrilling moments earlier in the season.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nLibby Hill of the ''Los Angeles Times'' commented on how ''Jessica Jones'' exposed modern day sexism and [[misogyny]] through Kilgrave's use of the phrase \"Smile\", calling the season \"the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique\" from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to \"similar well-meaning scenarios [that] play out in the real world time and again each day\" many in the form of gendered [[street harassment]], that resonates with many women. Hill also added that \"Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent,\" due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that \"''Jessica Jones'' is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise.\"<ref name=\"LATimesAnalysis\" /> Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that \"powerlessness is not gendered.\"<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" />\n\nKwame Opam at ''[[The Verge]]'' chose to examine rape and the nature of consent in the season. Comparing ''Jessica Jones'' to other television series that have depicted rape (''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', and ''[[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]''), Opam felt that \"since rape is one of the show's core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it's invisible, it's always there.\" He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, \"''Jessica Jones'' moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don't need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all.\"<ref name=\"VergeAnalysis\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, \"however exceptional Kilgrave's power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It's the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It's the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It's the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays \"of her own free will\". It's the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future.\" Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist \"red pillers\", and noting that his taking of the pills \"renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill's effects.\"<ref name=\"GuardianAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''Jessica Jones'' was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''Daredevil''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> [[Indiewire]] and ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''{{'}}s (2nd),<ref name=\"IndiewireTop102015\" /><ref name=\"StarLedgerTop102015\" /> [[NPR]]'s (3rd),<ref name=\"NPRTop122015\" /> [[ScreenCrush]]'s (4th),<ref name=\"ScreenCrushTop102015\" /> [[Digital Spy]]'s (5th),<ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''{{'}}s (6th),<ref name=\"ComplexTop252015\" /> [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"VultureTop102015\" /> ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (9th),<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> and ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s (11th).<ref name=\"TVGuideTop202015\" /> It was also included on un-ranked lists from Maureen Ryan of ''Variety'',<ref name=\"VarietyTop202015\" /> Mary McNamara of the ''Los Angeles Times'',<ref name=\"LATimesTop102015\" /> ''[[The Week (magazine)|The Week]]'',<ref name=\"WeekTop102015\" /> and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name=\"WiredTop152015\" /> In December 2015, IGN named ''Jessica Jones'' the Netflix's best original series released to date,<ref name=\"IGNNetflixTop10\" /> and it was named one of the Best New Shows of 2015 by Ryan,<ref name=\"VarietyTop20New2015\" /> as well as the tenth best new show of 2015 by ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen.<ref name=\"EWJensenTop102015\" /> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[AKA WWJD?]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" /> Additionally, ''Jessica Jones'' was the second most trending television series search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

Jones (TV series)#Episodes\n}}\nThe first season of the American [[web television]] series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', which is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Jessica Jones|of the same name]], follows a former superhero who opens her own detective agency after her superhero career comes to an end at the hands of [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Tall Girls Productions, with [[Melissa Rosenberg]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Krysten Ritter]] stars as Jones, while [[David Tennant]] plays Kilgrave. The two are joined by principal cast members [[Mike Colter]], [[Rachael Taylor]], [[Wil Traval]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], [[Eka Darville]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]. ''Jessica Jones'' entered development in late 2013, with Rosenberg reworking a series she had previously developed for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014, and production took place in New York City from February to August 2015. The season addresses issues of rape and assault, and was always intended to be far more \"adult\" than other Marvel projects, particularly in terms of sex. The show's cinematography took inspiration from [[Neo-noir|noir]], while visual effects house Shade VFX focused on creating \"invisible\" effects that would support its realistic approach.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in New York City on November 17, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on November 20 to an estimated high viewership and critical acclaim. Critics praised the performances of Ritter and Tennant, as well as the season's noir tone, approach to sexuality, and coverage of darker topics such as rape, assault and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. The season was awarded a [[Peabody Award]] in the category of \"Entertainment and Children's programs\", and a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation#Short Form|short form dramas]]. A [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]] of ''Jessica Jones'' was ordered on January 17, 2016.<ref name=\"S2Order\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A498D |overall=5 |season=5 |title=29 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-jessica-jones/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's jessica jones on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = AKA Ladies Night\n |DirectedBy      = [[S.

While not working, Jones spies on [[Luke Cage]], a bar owner who sees her looking into his bar and offers her free alcohol as a \"Ladies Night\" promotion, leading to the two sleeping together. She leaves upset after seeing a photo of a woman in his bathroom. Jones is approached by Barbara and Bob Shlottman after their daughter Hope began acting differently and disappeared. Jones discovers that Hope is with [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]], a man with mind control abilities who once controlled Jones, leaving her with [[PTSD]], and whom she believed was dead. Jones wants to flee, but is convinced by her friend and foster-sister [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]] to help Hope.

Jones lies to Cage that she had been hired by the husband of a woman who Cage had slept with. Cage, having not known that the woman was married, confronts the woman about it, and when she goes to her husband, he attacks Cage with a group. Jones helps fight off the men, and learns that Cage is gifted with unbreakable skin. Hogarth agrees to represent Shlottman if Jones can prove that Kilgrave exists. Jones remembers leaving Kilgrave to die after he was hit by a bus, and now tracks down the ambulance driver who had picked him up. The driver had donated both his kidneys to Kilgrave, and is now on dialysis. Jones finds the operating doctor who anonymously donated the dialysis machine. He agrees to testify for Shlottman, and reveals that he operated on Kilgrave without anesthesia since that would have blocked Kilgrave's abilities. When Hogarth meets with Shlottman, the latter reveals that Jones was once under Kilgrave's control as well.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = AKA It's Called Whiskey\n |DirectedBy      = [[David Petrarca]]\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=[[Liz Friedman]]|t=Liz Friedman & [[Scott Reynolds (writer)|Scott Reynolds]]}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones and Cage bond over their mutual powers, while Jones also tracks down a surgical grade anesthetic to subdue Kilgrave with. Hogarth, now divorcing Wendy (who discovered the affair) and unwilling to risk herself and her reputation despite Wendy's testimony, organizes for Walker to interview Shlottman about Kilgrave live on her radio talk show. Walker asks that anyone who believes they have been approached or controlled by Kilgrave contact Hogarth, and then publicly insults Kilgrave on air. Angered, Kilgrave sends police sergeant Will Simpson to kill Walker, with Jones having to use the anesthetic on Walker to convince Simpson that he has carried out his orders. Jones follows Simpson back to Kilgrave, who orders Simpson to walk off a balcony. Jones again convinces Simpson that he has carried out this order by knocking him out and taking him to the street below, telling him as he wakes that she caught him.

Jones tracks Eastman's husband to a rendezvous with his girlfriend only to discover a trap set by Eastman, who blames gifted people for the death of her mother during \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\" and who learned of Jones' powers from Spheeris. Angered as she recalls the death of her own parents, Jones convinces the Eastmans to leave her alone with a show of her power and a bluff over the number of other gifted in the city. Hogarth and Jones process a large number of people claiming to have been controlled by Kilgrave, forming a support group for those legitimately affected by him. Simpson attempts to apologize to a frightened Walker over his action while under Kilgrave's control; they eventually bond over the experience. Jones uses surveillance footage provided by Simpson and clues offered by the Kilgrave support group to learn that the photographer spying on her for Kilgrave is her drug addicted neighbor [[Malcolm Ducasse]]. \n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = AKA The Sandwich Saved Me\n |DirectedBy      = [[Stephen Surjik]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dana Baratta\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones recalls her brief time as a superhero as she debates whether to save Ducasse or to use him as a means of locating Kilgrave. Walker and Simpson begin a romantic relationship with Jones grudgingly allowing him to assist in a plot to capture Kilgrave. Simpson supplies ex-special operations skills and contacts, including access to a hermetically sealed room in which Kilgrave could be kept once the effects of the anesthetic wear off. They follow Ducasse to his daily meeting with Kilgrave where photographs of Jones are exchanged for drugs, which Kilgrave had forced Ducasse to become addicted to so he would obey Kilgrave even after his powers wore off, after around 12 hours of no contact. Simpson shoots Kilgrave with the anesthetic; Jones refuses to let him kill Kilgrave so he can be used to prove Shlottman innocent. Jones gets Kilgrave to Walker and the getaway car, but they are attacked by hired bodyguards who escape with the unconscious Kilgrave.

After paying a fellow inmate to beat her, Shlottman confesses to Jones that she is pregnant with Kilgrave's child and has been trying to miscarry. Jones gives her an abortion pill; Hogarth secretly takes the fetal remains. Cage hires Jones to help find the brother of someone, who has evidence on the death of Cage's wife [[Reva Connors]]. Connors had left Cage instructions to find a box she had hidden, but it was not there when he looked. Jones recalls Kilgrave having Connors lead them to the box, with Jones digging it up before killing Connors. Jones and Cage find the missing brother, and are given the file of the bus driver that accidentally hit Kilgrave (and who Cage believes hit Connors). Seeing that the driver had been drunk, Cage seeks revenge. Jones intervenes and confesses that Kilgrave forced her to kill Connors.

Wendy refuses to sign the papers. Ducasse helps Jones back to her apartment, where they find her neighbor Ruben, dead. Knowingly blaming Kilgrave, Jones devises a desperate plan: get herself imprisoned in a [[supermax prison]] so when Kilgrave inevitably comes for her, his abilities will be caught on camera. Walker and Simpson have their own plan, with Simpson following Kilgrave's security detail, though he does not tell Walker when he finds them at Jones's old house. Ducasse disposes of Ruben's body, though Jones finds him. Enacting her plan, Jones goes to a police station with Ruben's severed head and confesses to his murder. Her processing is interrupted when Kilgrave takes control of the station and declares his love for Jones, as she was the first person to resist him. He invites her \"home\", and Simpson later watches as Jones voluntarily enters the house with Kilgrave.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = AKA WWJD?\n |DirectedBy      = Simon Cellan Jones\n |WrittenBy       = Scott Reynolds\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones spends several days living with Kilgrave. Though he takes her phone so she cannot record him, she secretly gets Simpson's when she catches him sneaking into the house to plant a bomb. Not willing to let Kilgrave die until Shlottman is free, Jones tells Kilgrave about the bomb. Kilgrave, in an effort to prove that his nature was forced upon him, shows Jones a pendrive (which Connors had hidden in the box) containing footage of his parents experimenting on him as a child, and him eventually stopping them by his command. Jones shows Kilgrave that he can do good with his powers by convincing him to save several people. She visits Walker and asks whether she should stay with Kilgrave and try to use his abilities to change the world for good. When Jones, knowing that Kilgrave will harm some of his \"servants\" if she does not return, goes back to Kilgrave, she instead uses a distraction to incapacitate him, and flies away with him. Then, Simpson is seriously injured by his own bomb, which Kilgrave left for him.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = AKA Sin Bin\n |DirectedBy      = [[John Dahl]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jamie King & Dana Baratta\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Walker races Simpson to the hospital, where he insists on seeing a Dr. Kozlov from his days as an army sergeant. Kozlov gives him some pills, and his injuries heal miraculously. Jones imprisons Kilgrave in the hermetically sealed room, where she plans to torture him until he reveals his abilities on camera. Hogarth warns her that this would forfeit their case in court, and that the D.A. has offered a 20 year plea deal to Shlottman if she pleads guilty. Jones convinces Shlottman to not take the deal, and devises a new plan. From the footage of Kilgrave's experiments, Jones discovers the names of his parents, Louise and Albert Thompson, and from photographs realizes that his mother is a member of the support group. Jones confronts her and Albert, and convinces them to face their son. Jones also forces Clemons to act as a witness. In the cell, Kilgrave is remorseful, but Louise attempts to kill him to stop him from hurting anyone again, and he makes her kill herself. Jones saves Albert from a similar fate, but Kilgrave escapes.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = AKA 1,000 Cuts\n |DirectedBy      = [[Rosemary Rodriguez]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dana Baratta & Micah Schraft \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Kilgrave forces Hogarth to take him to a doctor; she goes to Wendy, hoping Kilgrave will force her to sign their divorce papers, but Kilgrave instead orders Wendy to kill Hogarth [[Lingchi|with a thousand cuts]] as revenge. Pam arrives, and accidentally kills Wendy to stop her by hitting her in the head with a [[vase]]. Thompson reveals that Kilgrave's abilities are a virus that he releases, and that a vaccine could be created from Jones's blood as Jones appears to have become immune to Kilgrave's influence. Simpson, under the influence of Kozlov's drugs (that enhance combat performance and numb pain) arrives at the cell, where Clemons is guarding the evidence needed to imprison Kilgrave. Set on killing Kilgrave instead, Simpson kills Clemons and destroys the evidence. He finds Walker with Thompson, who is unsuccessful in creating the vaccine, but she sends Simpson away when she sees how unstable he is, managing to take some of his pills from him in the process.

Jones discovered her abilities soon after. Now, Jones covers up Shlottman's death and Kilgrave's involvement in it, and begins searching morgues for Thompson's body as a lead. Affected by an increasing lack of sleep, Jones is injured in an accident, but does manage to find Clemons' body and deduces that Simpson killed him rather than Kilgrave. She agrees to meet with Simpson, and he attacks her in her apartment, overpowering the injured Jones. Walker arrives and uses Simpson's pills to help Jones defeat him. Not used to the pills, Walker requires medical attention.

After Cage recounts the events leading up to the explosion, in which he followed Jones to confront Kilgrave, they realize that Kilgrave is keeping Thompson alive to try and boost his abilities, and may be testing his increasing hold over people. While they investigate, Cage forgives Jones for her role in Connors' death, and the two begin to grow close again. They find a nightclub where Kilgrave tested his enhanced powers, and are confronted by him there. He reveals that he has been controlling Cage the whole time, having made him forgive Jones to earn her trust, and now unleashes Cage on Jones, escaping while they fight.

Thompson has been using the fetal remains that Hogarth kept, and believes that a full dose of his extracted drug could now make Kilgrave powerful enough to control Jones. Using Cage's phone, Jones tracks Kilgrave to the apartment of a wealthy couple, whom he has enslaved, in time to see Thompson die. Cage awakens, and decides to leave. Jones confronts Kilgrave at the couple's yacht, where he takes Walker hostage. When Jones allows this, Kilgrave believes that he finally has control over her again. However, when he tells her to say \"I love you\", Jones says it to Walker instead, and snaps Kilgrave's neck.

Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> but that was shortened to ''Marvel's Jessica Jones'' in June 2015.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> The season consists of 13 hour-long episodes.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe writers for the season worked in Los Angeles, with one member of the writing team on set in New York for filming.<ref name=\"WritersLocation\" /> Actress [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] talked about how the scripts developed through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary.<ref name=\"MossColterNYCC\" /> Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some [[Procedural (genre)|procedural]] elements to the show, \"but that's not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season.\" Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]] said that the \"fun about being a private detective is that the line between what's legal and what's not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, as much as it is to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How am I going to get through this day?'\" He also added that inspiration for the season came from \"the noir films from the '40s\" and \"film[s] like ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" />\n\nDescribing the tone of the season, Loeb said, \"When we first started talking about ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a psychological thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that's a very powerful, emotional place to start from.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called \"lazy storytelling\" and often a way to \"spice up\" male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an \"issue\" for the season to tackle.<ref name=\"RosenbergHRNov2015\" /> When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity and the use of the word 'fuck' in the season.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\", Rosenberg said, \"It was never our intention going in [to hit a social issue], and I think the minute you intend to do that, you're stepping up on a soap box. If you're digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you're going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you're also going to hit social issues.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Krysten Ritter]] as [[Jessica Jones]],<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]],<ref name=\"Colter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]],<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> [[Wil Traval]] as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Hope Shlottman,<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Eka Darville]] as [[Malcolm Ducasse]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /> [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]],<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"Moss2\" /> and [[David Tennant]] as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"Tennant\" />\n\nAppearing in recurring roles for the season are Susie Abromeit as Pam,<ref name=\"Abromeit\" /> Colby Minifie and Kieran Mulcare as Robyn and Ruben,<ref name=\"MinifieMulcare\" /> Nichole Yannetty as Nicole,<ref name=\"Ep3Cite\" /> [[Clarke Peters]] as Oscar Clemons,<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Michael Siberry]] and [[Lisa Emery]] as Albert and Louise Thompson,<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" /> and [[Robin Weigert]] as Wendy Ross-Hogarth.<ref name=\"Weigert\" /> [[Danielle Ferland]], Gillian Glasco, Ryan Farrell, and Paul Pryce also recur as victims of Kilgrave who join a support group established by Jones,<ref name=\"Supporters\" /> while [[Rosario Dawson]] and Royce Johnson reprise their roles of [[Claire Temple]] and Brett Mahoney, respectively, from ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DawsonJJ\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky returned as the costume designer for ''Jessica Jones'' from ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> and was assisted on the first episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots costume.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> On Jones's costume, Maslansky said she \"considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way.\" At least 10 versions of Jones's jacket were made, which started as an [[Acne Studios]] leather motorcycle jacket that had any \"bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details\" removed. 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nBecause Jones's costume does not evolve much throughout the season, Maslansky used flashbacks to show how her costume had evolved to the present day: for 'pre-Kilgrave' Jessica Jones, Maslansky gave the character \"more pulled together\" clothes, albeit \"still kind of edgy\" clothes that did not change who she was as a character, but were just \"different\". For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead \"wear[s] her jeans and find[s] a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, maybe something that she borrowed from Trish\". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a \"variety\" of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to \"look dirty and old\"; \"a mere shadow of its former sandwich self,\" becoming \"more of a hoagie than a sandwich.\" In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's real situation, with Maslansky calling it \"so beautiful and so free and so light\".<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\nFor Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits created by designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], rather than custom-making them as she originally planned, as Smith \"was {{em|all}} about purple\" in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers \"wanted to find a place where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally \"fairly friendly color, and he's anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" /> Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone \"who wears his clothing like an armor,\" with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> For a character like Trish Walker, who does not have the same kind of \"statement costume\" as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so \"even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of [[rag & bone]] jeans with a [[Chlo\u00e9]] top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans.\" Maslansky added that Robin was \"a blast to dress\" because of her \"quirky\" personality, yet she was still able to \"put herself together aesthetically.\" For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming \"a little brighter and a little more hopeful.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Jessica Jones'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April, Marvel Comics' [[Editor in chief|editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] stated that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> The season went into production in February 2015 in [[The Bronx]] at [[Lehman College]] with the [[working title]] ''Violet'',<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBronx\" /> and aimed to film each episode over nine days, on average.<ref name=\"Billeter\" /> Filming concluded in mid-late August.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Other filming locations in New York City used included the East Village's Horseshoe Bar for Luke's Bar; the [[33rd Street (PATH station)|33rd Street PATH station]] and a [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]] train; the 101st Street area for the exterior of Jessica's apartment (with the interior apartment settings created on a sound stage); [[Douglaston, Queens]] for Jessica's childhood home; the [[Angel Orensanz Center]] for Jessica and Luke's fight in \"[[AKA Take a Bloody Number]]\"; [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]] and Pier 88 for locations in \"[[AKA Smile]]\";<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]]; [[Nolita]]; near the 39th Street entrance to the [[Lincoln Tunnel]]; [[Tribeca]]; [[Bryant Park]]; [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]; [[Gramercy Park|Gramercy]]; [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]] near the [[Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant]]; [[Long Island City]], including the Allied Extruder Factory for the weed growing facility, with exteriors shots taken from near [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]]; the [[Queensboro Bridge]] on the Queens side; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain]] in [[Central Park]]; and [[Industry City]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\nConcerning inspirations on the season, Loeb revealed that \"''Chinatown''... is one of the things that influenced [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Michael Gaydos]] when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone's in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they're having a conversation, that's the stuff that makes it interesting.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director [[S. J. Clarkson]] took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of [[Wong Kar-wai]] as reference to create \"unconventional\" compositions, with Billeter explaining, \"There were a lot of foreground elements [and] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia.\" Billeter shot the season with a [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company#Red Dragon|Red Epic Dragon]] camera in [[4K resolution]], with [[5K resolution|5K]] used for some visual effects shots, and with [[Panavision]] PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and \"good composition\", but did occasionally employ a [[camera dolly]] or [[steadicam]]. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s to [[LED]]s, so he tried to recreate the \"warm, dirty color of sodium vapor\" for night exterior scenes.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nProduction designer Loren Weeks described Marvel's Hell's Kitchen as having \"a little more [[East Village, Manhattan|[East] Village]] quality.\"<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> To achieve the explosion at Luke's Bar, Weeks said, \"We could not take out the windows [at Horseshoe Bar], which are [made up of] multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We didn't know frankly when we picked that location that we would have that explosion... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects.\" For the scenes on the PATH train and station, location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nShade VFX created over 600 effects shots for the season, with \"invisible\" effects \"the showpiece, helping to push forward the darker elements the series.\" Therefore, effects supervisor Karl Coyner and producer Julie Long worked closely with the crew on set to \"execute stunts, set extensions, explosions, wetwork and fire sequences\" while filming, rather than have Shade create those effects digitally.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXShots\" /> An effect that Shade was required to create was tinting Kilgrave's skin purple \"in a few key scenes\" where he is using his powers, a nod to the comic iteration's purple-skinned appearance.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXPurple\" />\n\n===Music===\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, [[Sean Callery]] revealed he was composing music for ''Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"CalleryComposer\" /> eventually stating that the music required for each episode ranged from 9 to 20 minutes, totaling approximately 415 minutes of music for the season.<ref name=\"CalleryVariety\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on June 3, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\nAll music composed by Sean Callery, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 59:53\n\n| title1          = Jessica Jones Main Title\n| length1         = 1:09\n\n| title2          = Then There's the Matter of You\n| length2         = 1:18\n\n| title3          = Fire Escape Night Shift\n| length3         = 4:16\n\n| title4          = Alias Investigations\n| length4         = 2:28\n\n| title5          = Fight at Luke's Bar\n| length5         = 2:21\n\n| title6          = Nurse Jessica\n| length6         = 2:13\n\n| title7          = Rescuing Hope from the Hotel Bed\n| length7         = 3:50\n\n| title8          = Kidnapping Kilgrave\n| length8         = 3:20\n\n| title9          = Sleepover at Luke's\n| length9         = 3:03\n\n| title10         = Jessica on the Move\n| length10        = 2:44\n\n| title11         = Cockroach\n| length11        = 3:09\n\n| title12         = Luke's Revenge on the Bus Driver\n| music12     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length12        = 2:31\n\n| title13         = Elevator Massacre\n| length13        = 2:52\n\n| title14         = Looking for Kilgrave\u2013Bus Accident Vision\n| length14        = 1:56\n\n| title15         = Hospital Cat and Mouse\n| length15        = 3:11\n\n| title16         = Gift from Trish\n| length16        = 2:55\n\n| title17         = Kilgrave Escapes His Glass Prison\n| length17        = 1:41\n\n| title18         = Tailing Malcolm\n| length18        = 2:22\n\n| title19         = Jessica Confesses to Luke\n| music19     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length19        = 2:58\n\n| title20         = Restaurant Flashback\n| length20        = 1:48\n\n| title21         = Jones\u2013Cage Match\n| music21     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length21        = 2:58\n\n| title22         = Final Justice for the Purple Man\n| length22        = 2:33\n\n| title23         = Maybe It's Enough the World Thinks I'm a Hero\n| length23        = 2:17\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nOn existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, \"''Jessica Jones'' is a very, very different show than ''Daredevil''. We exist in a cinematic universe, [and] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they're very different\u2026 That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into ''Daredevil'' or what's come before? And the answer is no.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" /> On references or \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" in the season, Rosenberg explained that \"A little is always there and in the writer's room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they're all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [''Alias'' comic].\" She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a \"little something in it.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" />\n\nJeryn Hogarth is closely associated with [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in the comics, and also worked with Luke Cage as part of those characters' ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' team.<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Like ''Daredevil'', the season makes references to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and the Avengers (specifically Hulk and Captain America, though not by name).<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> Jessica also mentions [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|Angela del Toro]] as another private investigator,<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K'un-Lun and Iron Fist.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> Paul Tassi, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', was disappointed with how the season fit into the larger MCU, feeling the season seemed \"removed from the world of ''The Avengers''\" and did not acknowledge ''Daredevil'' enough given that \"it's supposed to be sharing at least this little {{em|corner}} of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it.\"<ref name=\"ForbesMCUConnection\" /> Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that ''Jessica Jones''{{'}}s lack of overt connections to the MCU was \"the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, ''Jessica Jones'' also proves the MCU's thematic durability.\"<ref name=\"InverseJJ\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Jessica Jones'' was released on November 20, 2015, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> In January 2015, a month after Marvel announced a 2015 release for the season,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> Sarandos had said that it was \"too hard to say now\" if the season would actually release in 2015, with Netflix's plan to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after ''Daredevil''{{'}}s April 2015 release.<ref name=\"NetflixReleasePlans\" /> However, Netflix soon confirmed that the season would indeed release in 2015,<ref name=\"NetflixReleaseConfirm\" /> announcing the November 20 release date in September.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nIn May 2015, Marvel announced plans to reprint ''Alias'', the comic that the series is based on, with new covers from [[David W.

The reprints, which were all released digitally in June 2015, and up to issue 15 in two trade paperbacks in September, were intended to both celebrate the history of Jessica Jones, and introduce new audiences to the character ahead of the release of the season.<ref name=\"AliasReprint\" /> In late September through early October, Marvel and Netflix released short teasers for the season, which chronicled a day of Jones' life.<ref name=\"Teasers1\" /><ref name=\"Teasers2\" /> Also in early October, Marvel digitally released a 12-page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic by the original ''Alias'' creative team\u2014Bendis, Gaydos, and Mack\u2014set in the universe of the television series.<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> The one-shot was created as an exclusive for [[New York Comic Con]], where a print version was distributed.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|The comic]] sees Jessica Jones coming into contact with ''Daredevil'' character [[Turk Barrett]], and includes a short sequence featuring Daredevil,<ref name=\"OneShot\" /> to celebrate \"the connective tissue that will build between the series.\"<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> Also during New York Comic Con, Marvel set up a [[street marketing]] campaign, and screened \"[[AKA Ladies Night]]\" on October 10, while at the Marvel Booth fans could take their picture with the Alias Investigations desk, with Kilgrave's eyes appearing in the background of the final animation.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> Marvel additionally partnered with [[Uber]] during the event to provide select riders with complimentary trips to or from the convention in custom designed SUVs.<ref name=\"NYCCUber\" />\n\nA full trailer was released at the end of October, with Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] feeling that it helped establish the same tone as ''Daredevil'' and introduced \"Marvel's creepiest villain yet\" with Kilgrave. She also compared Jessica to some of the other female characters of the MCU\u2014[[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Melinda May]], and [[Peggy Carter]]\u2014feeling that Jessica stood out from the others because she does not have \"a sense of togetherness\" and was the most relatable because of her struggle with trauma, and that the season would have the amount of creative space required to explore the character that the other female characters were lacking.<ref name=\"CBRTrailer\" /> A second trailer was released on November 10, 2015. Sarene Leeds of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' felt that this trailer highlighted empowerment, compared to the first that \"was about illustrating the fear behind Jones's past\".<ref name=\"WSJTrailer2\" /> The season held its premiere in New York City on November 17.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on August 22, 2017,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on December 5, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on a sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, from September to December 2015, episodes of ''Jessica Jones'' averaged 4.8 million viewers during a 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel, [[NBCUniversal]] president of research and media development, in a presentation aimed to provide \"perspective\" when stating \"digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business\".<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers\" /> Netflix CCO [[Ted Sarandos]] responded to the data by saying that \"the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn't reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of.\"<ref name=\"NetflixViewersResponse\" /> A further study from Symphony, for the same time period, found ''Jessica Jones'' to be one of the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic, ahead of any broadcast network series.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers2\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 26% of the viewers that the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align             = left\n | width             = 150\n | direction         = vertical\n | footer          = Krysten Ritter (top) and David Tennant (bottom) received near universal praise for their portrayals of Jessica Jones and Kilgrave, respectively, with Ritter able to \"display her impressive range\" to give \"an exceptional performance\", and Tennant being called \"a horrific joy to behold\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesReview\" />\n <!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Krysten Ritter 2011.jpg\n | width1            = \n | alt1              = \n <!--image 2-->\n | image2            = 2009 07 31 David Tennant smile 09.jpg\n | width2            = \n | alt2              = \n}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 94% approval rating with an average rating of 8.24/10 based on 79 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Jessica Jones'' builds a multifaceted drama around its engaging antihero, delivering what might be Marvel's strongest TV franchise to date.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica-jones/s01/ |title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 1 (2015) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 81 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating what the website considers to be \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones |title=Marvel's Jessica Jones : Season 1 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe early screening of the first episode at New York Comic Con was met by a very positive reaction from the crowd.<ref name=\"IGNInitialThoughts\" /> George Marston of [[Newsarama]] gave the first episode a 10 out of 10, saying the season \"strikes a balance between self-aware noir and Marvel's first flirtations with psychological horror....not just another hit for Marvel and Netflix, but a landmark moment for female superheroes on TV.\"<ref name=\"NramaPilotReview\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] felt that \"''Jessica Jones'' starts out with a strong premiere episode that...easily goes further than anything in the MCU in terms of sexuality.\" He called Ritter \"a commendably tough, sardonic\" Jessica Jones and praised the supporting cast for the strong impressions they made,<ref name=\"IGNInitialThoughts\" /> later scoring the episode an 8.5 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNEp1Review\" /> Evan Valentine of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] gave the episode 5 stars out of 5, feeling that Tennant would \"ascend to the same level as [[Tom Hiddleston]]'s [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]'s [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] as one of the cornerstones of villainy in the MCU\".<ref name=\"ColliderPilotReview\" /> Katharine Trendacosta of [[io9]] also had positive thoughts on \"AKA Ladies Night\", highlighting the episode's use of light and color, especially with purple, and the way it portrays New York as how it \"actually looks\u2014not overly bright and shiny and clean, but not suffering a never-ending power-outage either\".<ref name=\"io9PilotThoughts\" /> Abraham Riesman noted the episode's presentation of sexuality, which \"was shockingly and refreshingly honest\", compared to Marvel's other films and television series. He concluded by applauding the season's bringing up of the topics of [[rape]] and PTSD.<ref name=\"VulturePilotSexuality\" />\n\nReviewing the first seven episodes of the season, Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave positive thoughts on ''Jessica Jones'', stating, \"The show, which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure-handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, is not just a contender for the title Best Marvel-related TV property; in a supremely crowded TV scene, it is one of the year's most distinctive new dramas.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Jack Shepard of ''[[The Independent]]'', also on the first seven episodes, felt the season \"not only matches [''Daredevil''] but exceeds expectations.\" Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant's Kilgrave, feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel, and possibly \"the best on-screen comic book villain since [[Heath Ledger]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\"<ref name=\"IndependentReview\" /> ''Forbes''{{'}} Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes, \"the answer is a resounding yes\" if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television, claiming, \"In no uncertain terms, ''Jessica Jones'' is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced. It contains all the hopeful anticipation of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|[''Agents of''&nbsp;] ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'']], all the feminist-overtones of ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' and all the grittiness of ''Daredevil''.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" /> \n\n''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''{{'s}} Dominic Patten also had praise for the season, particularly Rosenberg's influence on it, the coverage of topics such as \"PTSD, abuse, assault, shame, and death\" and the cast, highlighting Tennant's Kilgrave as the actor's best role as well as the MCU's best villain.<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" /> Mary McNamara from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt ''Jessica Jones'' \"rewrote the definition of superhuman\" and was \"a marvel\", lauding the season's \"breathtaking\" examination of recovery from a sexually, emotionally and physically abusive relationship.<ref name=\"LATimesReview\" /> Daniel Fienberg for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' was also positive, saying the season \"looks and feels a bit like a cable anti-hero series\u2014but it's really more of a post-hero story, making it fascinating and unique in a marketplace that doesn't lack for costumed do-gooders of all types.\" His one criticism was that \"the show shares Jessica's monomaniacal fixation on [Kilgrave] and the result is a sort of narrative claustrophobia...Everything in these opening episodes ties back to Kilgrave and Kilgrave is such a twisted figure that it's hard for any light to get in.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Melissa Maerz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was slightly more critical of the season, awarding it a \"B\". Though Maerz felt Ritter was a good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography, she felt the season \"could've made for a gritty character drama if it weren't for the noir clich\u00e9s (saxophone music, shadows through glass) and a procedural structure that's very ''CSI: Marvel''. The show's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica's: It starts out with extraordinary potential, but somewhere along the way, it loses what make it special.\"<ref name=\"EWReview\" />\n\nGoldman, later reviewing the whole season, gave it a 9.3 out of 10. He commended all the actors, the relationship between Jessica and Trish, and the episode \"Sin Bin\", though was critical of the character Robyn. Additionally, Goldman also felt the season spent \"too many scenes devoted to Jeri's marital strife\" and that it hit its peak \"a bit before the actual end of the season\" similar to ''Daredevil'', with most of the thrilling moments earlier in the season.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nLibby Hill of the ''Los Angeles Times'' commented on how ''Jessica Jones'' exposed modern day sexism and [[misogyny]] through Kilgrave's use of the phrase \"Smile\", calling the season \"the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique\" from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to \"similar well-meaning scenarios [that] play out in the real world time and again each day\" many in the form of gendered [[street harassment]], that resonates with many women. Hill also added that \"Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent,\" due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that \"''Jessica Jones'' is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise.\"<ref name=\"LATimesAnalysis\" /> Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that \"powerlessness is not gendered.\"<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" />\n\nKwame Opam at ''[[The Verge]]'' chose to examine rape and the nature of consent in the season. Comparing ''Jessica Jones'' to other television series that have depicted rape (''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', and ''[[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]''), Opam felt that \"since rape is one of the show's core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it's invisible, it's always there.\" He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, \"''Jessica Jones'' moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don't need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all.\"<ref name=\"VergeAnalysis\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, \"however exceptional Kilgrave's power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It's the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It's the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It's the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays \"of her own free will\". It's the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future.\" Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist \"red pillers\", and noting that his taking of the pills \"renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill's effects.\"<ref name=\"GuardianAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''Jessica Jones'' was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''Daredevil''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> [[Indiewire]] and ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''{{'}}s (2nd),<ref name=\"IndiewireTop102015\" /><ref name=\"StarLedgerTop102015\" /> [[NPR]]'s (3rd),<ref name=\"NPRTop122015\" /> [[ScreenCrush]]'s (4th),<ref name=\"ScreenCrushTop102015\" /> [[Digital Spy]]'s (5th),<ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''{{'}}s (6th),<ref name=\"ComplexTop252015\" /> [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"VultureTop102015\" /> ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (9th),<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> and ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s (11th).<ref name=\"TVGuideTop202015\" /> It was also included on un-ranked lists from Maureen Ryan of ''Variety'',<ref name=\"VarietyTop202015\" /> Mary McNamara of the ''Los Angeles Times'',<ref name=\"LATimesTop102015\" /> ''[[The Week (magazine)|The Week]]'',<ref name=\"WeekTop102015\" /> and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name=\"WiredTop152015\" /> In December 2015, IGN named ''Jessica Jones'' the Netflix's best original series released to date,<ref name=\"IGNNetflixTop10\" /> and it was named one of the Best New Shows of 2015 by Ryan,<ref name=\"VarietyTop20New2015\" /> as well as the tenth best new show of 2015 by ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen.<ref name=\"EWJensenTop102015\" /> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[AKA WWJD?]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" /> Additionally, ''Jessica Jones'' was the second most trending television series search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!
