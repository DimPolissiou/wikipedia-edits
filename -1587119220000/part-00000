Bonny and Opobo are of the same origin, both belonging to the [[Ibani tribe]]. An [[Igbo people|Igbo]] man (who was subsequently initiated into the [[Ibani]]) called [[Jubo Jubogha]] rose from slavery to lead the Anna Pepple chieftaincy house of Bonny. In 1870, Jubo first arrived in what is now Opobo, having moved there due to a [[Kingdom of Bonny#Bonny civil war|civil war]] in Bonny between his followers and those of Chief [[Oko Jumbo]], the leader of the rival Manilla Pepple chieftaincy family.<ref name=Jones2001/>\nHe was accommodated by the [[Nkoro]] leader King Kpokpo,<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/36981645/The-Izon-of-the-Niger-Delta-Chapter-22</ref> along with Chief Ubani, and formed what he called the \"Kingdom of Opobo\" soon afterwards. The king named his new state after Amanyanabo Opubo \"Pepple\" Perekule the Great, a Pepple king in Bonny that had reigned there from 1792 to 1830.\n\nJubo Jubogha became involved in [[palm oil]] trading with Europeans.  He started a trading post at Opobo Town, close to Ikot Abasi and 4 miles southwest of the Opobo river. Due to his dealings with them, he soon acquired the [[trade name]] ''Jaja''. Jubo Jubogha was never on good terms with the [[Ngwa]] people to the north, or the [[Annang]] and the [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] to the east, as he declared himself as the middleman in palm oil trading, thus asking them to stop trading directly with the Europeans. This resulted in a war (the Ikot Udo Obong War) between Jubo and the Annang and Ibuno people as recorded by Nair.<ref>Cf. Nair, 1972, page 183</ref> In 1887, he was deceived when he was told to go and negotiate with the Queen of England by the British. He was captured upon his arrival on the consul's flagship, and was sent into exile in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]] in the [[West Indies]] thereafter.\n\n==Traditions==\nThe following are a few of Opobo's unique customs: <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punchng.com/land-of-the-great-king-jaja-where-making-noise-at-night-is-forbidden/|title=Opobo: Land of the \u2018great\u2019 King Jaja where making noise at night is forbidden|last=Published|website=Punch Newspapers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\n* Dogs are forbidden in Opobo. This tradition, which has its roots in ancient times, is one of the most important taboos the people of this coastal town hold on to. While the people are free to bring in dog meat to eat in their homes whenever they feel like it, they are not allowed to keep dogs as pets or bring such into the community. For those, who flout this grand rule, the penalty is usually grave. In addition  \n* In Opobo, one is not allowed to shoot a gun. Such a thing is only to occur by royal sanction during a war. * Individuals are forbidden from wearing caps while passing through the gateway linking one compound to another. The gateways are small roofed passages, essentially a series of tunnels, connecting one compound to another. On the floor of such gateways is a crossbar, which those passing are forbidden from stepping foot on. Adhering to this rule while passing through the place is a mark of respect for the high chief of a particular compound, which is also referred to as a war canoe house.\n\nWhile these taboos could be said to hold sway during daytime, another set of unusual ones rules the land at nighttime. Some of that set include: \n\n* Making noise, pounding or quarrelling at night is forbidden. While it is not uncommon to hear giant loud speakers blaring music at hundreds of decibels at night time, with a cacophony of voices providing background percussion in other communities, in Opobo such a thing is totally forbidden. Making any form of noise at night is one of the biggest offences anyone can commit in this island community. You could be labelled an enemy of the town. Similarly, quarrelling and fighting at night is taboo here as well. Regardless of how provoked you are, you must wait till the break of dawn to vent your anger on whoever has provoked you.\n\nBreaking any of these rules attracts a fine of N7,000 each or a serious punishment by the community heads .\n\n===The Initiation into Womanhood===\nA certified wife who has not been initiated into womanhood with the appropriate initiation ceremony, known as the ''Mgbede'', is not allowed to tie a special wrapper called 'George'. Such a woman would also be denied many other rights: there are sacred places that she cannot enter and she will not be entitled to mix freely with women that have been initiated. In fact, she can be traditionally disgraced by the other women in the community at any time.\n\n[[File:King Jaja of Opobo's Palace.jpg|thumb|King Jaja of Opobo's Palace]]\n\n==Rulers==\n\nThe rulers of Opobo were:<ref name=wstates/>\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:10em;\"|Start !!style=\"width:10em;\"| End !!

This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group [[health insurance]] plans. In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred.\n\nIn other countries patient self-referral to a [[medical specialist]] for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from [[Health insurance|private insurance schemes]] or [[national health insurance]].\n\n[[Allied health professions|Allied health professionals]], such as [[physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[respiratory therapists]], [[occupational therapist]]s, [[Speech and language pathology|speech therapists]], and [[dietitians]], also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral.\n\n===Tertiary care===\n[[File:NationalNeurologyHospital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] is a specialist neurological hospital.]]\n{{See also|Medicine}}\n'''Tertiary care''' is specialized consultative health care, usually for [[inpatient]]s and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced [[medicine|medical]] investigation and treatment, such as a [[tertiary referral hospital]].<ref>Johns Hopkins Medicine.

This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group [[health insurance]] plans. In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred.\n\nIn other countries patient self-referral to a [[medical specialist]] for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from [[Health insurance|private insurance schemes]] or [[national health insurance]].\n\n[[Allied health professions|Allied health professionals]], such as [[physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[respiratory therapists]], [[occupational therapist]]s, [[Speech and language pathology|speech therapists]], and [[dietitians]], also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral.\n\n===Tertiary care===\n[[File:NationalNeurologyHospital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] is a specialist neurological hospital.]]\n{{See also|Medicine}}\n'''Tertiary care''' is specialized consultative health care, usually for [[inpatient]]s and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced [[medicine|medical]] investigation and treatment, such as a [[tertiary referral hospital]].<ref>Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Being unable to conquer the place despite fighting for six months, he installed a fort in the hill above side. Staying there, he gave training and organized numerous forces. This scared the people of vicinity and they started fleeing their homes. Just fifty households remained back in Dhulikhel. Despite this, Mahindra Sing Rai fought valiantly. Prithivi Narayan Shah was frustrated to see yet another defeat when one soldier stabbed Mahindra Sing in the back and roped spear. He died on the spot. His brother, Naamsing also was stabbed with khukuri (cited by Somdhwoj Bista, ''Shahi sainik Itihaas:'' 36). In this way, the battle ended and Dhulikhel was won on B.S. 1820 Kartik 10 on Sunday.

[[Yogi Naraharinath|Yogi Narharinath]], in Itihas Prakash writes about the difficulty Prithvi Narayan Shah faced in conquering Dhulikhel. He writes:\n\n\"Prithvi Narayan Shah found it difficult to capture Dhulikhel. He got scared by the bravery of the locals. Being unable to conquer the place despite fighting for six months, he installed a fort in the hill above side. Staying there, he gave training and organized numerous forces. This scared the people of vicinity and they started fleeing their homes. Just fifty households remained back in Dhulikhel. Despite this, Mahindra Sing Rai fought valiantly. Prithivi Narayan Shah was frustrated to see yet another defeat when one soldier stabbed Mahindra Sing in the back and roped spear. He died on the spot. His brother, Naamsing also was stabbed with khukuri (cited by Somdhwoj Bista, ''Shahi sainik Itihaas:'' 36). In this way, the battle ended and Dhulikhel was won on B.S. 1820 Kartik 10 on Sunday. The next day, Khadpu and [[Panauti]] were conquered whereas on Kartik 14 Gorkhalis won Banepa, Sanga and Nala.\nUntil B.S. 1972, administrative center of Kavrepalanchok was at [[Chautara]].

Rack units are typically denoted without a space between the number of units and the 'U'. Thus a 4U [[server (computing)|server]] enclosure (case) is {{convert|7|in|1|spell=in}} high.\n\n===Hand===\n{{main|Hand (unit)}}\nThe '''hand''' is a non-[[SI]] unit of length equal to exactly {{convert|4|in|mm|1}}. It is normally used to measure the height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826125716/http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 August 2006 |title=Equestrian Federation of Australia National Measuring Scheme Effective from 1 January 2002 and amended in March 2002 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2002 |website=www.equestrian.org.au/ |publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.\n\n===Light-nanosecond===\nThe light-nanosecond is defined as exactly 29.9792458 [[centimetre|cm]]. It was popularized as a unit of distance by [[Grace Hopper]] as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 [[centimetre|cm]] or one [[foot (unit)|foot]]): \"The [[speed of light]] is one foot per nanosecond.\" In her speaking engagements, she was well known for passing out light-nanoseconds of wire to the audience, and contrasting it with light-microseconds (a coil of wire 1,000 times as long) and light-picoseconds (the size of ground [[black pepper]]). Over the course of her life, she found many uses for this visual aid, including demonstrating the waste of sub-optimal programming, illustrating advances in computer speed, and simply giving young scientists and policy makers the ability to conceptualize the magnitude of very large and small numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-story.html |title=Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper|date=4 May 2006 |publisher=US Navy}}</ref>\n\n===Metric foot===\nA [[metric foot]] (defined as 300&nbsp;mm, or about 11.8 inches) has been used occasionally in the UK<ref>{{cite web |  title=BBC TV Centre | website=History of Television Studios in London | url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm | quote=Measurements are in metric feet (30cm)...}}</ref> but has never been an official unit.\n\n===Horse===\n{{main|Horse length}}\nHorses are used to measure distances in [[horse racing]] \u2013 a ''horse length'' (shortened to merely a ''length'' when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=off|disp=or}}. Shorter distances are measured in fractions of a ''horse length''; also common are measurements of a full or fraction of a ''head'', a ''neck'', or a ''nose''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Horse Racing Spread Betting \u2013 Get Started | website=Spreadex | url=https://www.spreadex.com/sports/get-started/horse-racing-spread-betting/winning-distances/ | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Boat length===\nIn rowing races such as the [[Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]], the margin of victory and of defeat is expressed in fractions and multiples of ''lengths''. The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman. The [[Racing Rules of Sailing]] also makes heavy use of boat lengths.\n\n===Football field (length)===\n<!--American football field (unit) redirects here. If you change the section heading please update the redirect\n-->A football field is often used as a comparative measurement of length when talking about distances that may be hard to comprehend when stated in terms of standard units.\n\nAn [[American football field]] is usually understood to be {{convert|100|yd|m}} long, though it is technically {{convert|120|yd|m}} when including the two {{convert|10|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones. The field is {{convert|160|ft|yd m|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2015-nfl-rulebook#rule-1.-the-field|title=2015 NFL Rulebook}}</ref>\n\nA [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, including two {{convert|20|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones.\n\nMedia in the UK also use the [[association football pitch|football pitch]] as a unit of length, although the area of the [[association football]] pitch is not fixed, but may vary within limits of {{convert|90|-|120|m|yd|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|45|-|90|m|yd|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in width. The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\n===Block===\nA [[city block]] (in most US cities) is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement \"block\" usually refers to a north\u2013south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in places (like Manhattan)  with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east\u2013west and north\u2013south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east\u2013west plus the number north\u2013south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance}}</ref>\n\n===The Earth's circumference===\nThe circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator \"would circle the Earth four and a half times\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989}}</ref> According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40007862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40075016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft}}.\n\nThe metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.\n\n===Earth-to-Moon distance===\nThe distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end \"would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times\".\n\nThe abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is \"LD\" which stands for \"[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]\", used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.\n\n===Siriometer===\nThe [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].<!--Google test prefers US spelling-->\n\n==Area==\n===Barn===\n{{Main|Barn (unit)}}\nOne barn is 10<sup>\u221228</sup> square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus.

Following the so-called \"quarter-girth formula\" (the square of one quarter of the circumference in inches multiplied by {{frac|1|144}} of the length in feet), the notional log is four feet in circumference, one inch of which yields the hoppus board foot, 1 foot yields the hoppus foot, and 50 feet yields a hoppus ton. This translates to a hoppus foot being equal to {{convert|1.273|ft3|in3 m3}}. The hoppus board foot, when milled, yields about one [[board foot]].

The amount of material that, say, an aircraft could carry into the air is often visualised as the number of bags of cement that it could lift.

In case of planet orbiting a star, ''M<sub>total</sub>'' can be approximated to mean the mass of the central object. More specifically in the case of Sun and Earth the numbers reduce to ''M<sub>total</sub>'' ~ 1, ''a'' ~ 1 and ''T'' ~ 1.\n\n==Time==\n<!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order -->\n\n===Light-distance===\n[[George Gamow]] discussed measurements of time such as the \"light-mile\" and \"light-foot\", the time taken for light to travel the specified unit distance, defined by \"reversing the procedure\" used in defining a light-year.<ref>{{cite book |author=George Gamow|title=One Two Three ...

A sidereal day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 SI seconds.\n\n===Decimal time systems===\n{{main|Decimal time}}\n[[File:Decimal_Time_Clock.jpeg|thumb|Decimal Time clock reading 2.50 DT equivalent to 6 AM standard time]]\nThe measurement of time is unique in SI in that while the [[second]] is the base unit, and measurements of time smaller than a second use prefixed units smaller than a second (e.g. microsecond, nanosecond, etc.), measurements larger than a second instead use traditional divisions, including the [[sexagesimal]]-based ''[[minute]]'' and ''[[hour]]'' as well as the less regular ''[[day]]'' and ''[[year]]'' units.\n\nSI allows for the use of larger prefixed units based on the second, a system known as [[metric time]], but this is seldom used, since the number of seconds in a day (86,400 or, [[leap second|in rare cases, 86,401]]) negate one of the metric system's primary advantages: easy conversion by multiplying or dividing by powers of ten.\n\nThere have been numerous proposals and usage of [[decimal time]], most of which were based on the day as the base unit, such that the number of units between any two events that happen at the same time of day would be equal to the number of days between them multiplied by some integer power of ten. In dynastic China, the [[k\u00e8]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day \"weeks\". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.<ref>See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205531/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh |date=6 June 2011 }}, precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds. Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.\n\nIn addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].\n\n===Sol===\n{{main|Sol (day on Mars)}}\n{{further|Timekeeping on Mars}}\nThe United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a \"sol\"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88,775 SI seconds, or 2,375 seconds (about 39 minutes) longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system (instead of breaking down the sol into 25\u00d753\u00d767 or 25\u00d767\u00d753 SI second divisions) slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars; Martian hours, minutes and seconds are thus 2.75% longer than their SI-compatible counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Darian calendar]] is an arrangement of sols into a Martian year. It maintains a seven-sol week (retaining Sunday through Saturday naming customs), with four weeks to a month and 24 months to a Martian year, which contains 668 or 669 sols depending on [[leap year]]s. The last Saturday of every six months is skipped over in the Darian calendar.\n\n===Dog year===\n[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]\nThere are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a [[List of common misconceptions|popular myth]] regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.\n*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.<ref name=dogyear>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612143355/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)].

Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;\u2014 Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic year===\n{{Main|Galactic year}}\nThe galactic year, GY, is the time it takes the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core, approximately 250 million years ([[megaannum]] or \"Ma\").

Each Kermit is equivalent to 14.4 minutes; the derivative math of (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour )/100. More precise time can be counted by dividing by 1000 or even 10000. The name Kermit came from a combination of the surname of the president of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 1983 (Dr. [[Larkin Kerwin]]). The original working model of KerMetric time as conceived by W. Thayer of NRC was assembled by the designated Clock Construction Team of John Phillips, Ron Hawkins, Les Moore and Willie Thayer in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/timemetricdispcalc3.html|title=KerMetric Time Display Calculator|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Moment ===\nA '''[[Moment (time)|moment]]''' '''was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] unit of time'''. The movement of a shadow on a [[sundial]] covered 40 moments in a [[Solar time|solar hour]]. An hour in this case meant one twelfth of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The length of a [[Solar time|solar hour]] depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the [[season]], so the length of a [[Moment (time)|moment]] in modern [[Second|seconds]] was not fixed, but '''on [[average]], a [[Moment (time)|moment]] corresponded to 90 seconds.'''\n\n===Thirds, Fourths===\n\nThe term \"[[Minute]]\" usually means {{frac|1|60}} of an [[hour]], coming from \"a minute division of an hour\". The term \"[[Second]]\" comes from \"the [[Second#Sexagesimal_divisions_of_calendar_time_and_day|second minute division]] of an hour\", as it's {{frac|1|60}} of a minute, or {{frac|1|60}} of {{frac|1|60}} of an hour. While usually sub-second units are represented with [[International_System_of_Units|SI]] prefixes on the second (e.g., [[millisecond|milliseconds]]), this system can be extrapolated further, such that a \"Third\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a second, and a \"Fourth\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a third, etc. These units are occasionally used in astronomy to denote angles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Herschel |first=William |authorlink= |year=1785 |title=Catalogue of Double Stars |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=75 |issue= |pages=40\u2013126 |jstor=106749 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0006 }}</ref>\n\n==Angular measure==\n===Furman===\nThe Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s.

There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation. Its value is equivalent to [[Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals|Tau]]/256 radians, or about 0.0245436926 radians.\n\n===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===\n{{Main|Grad (angle)}}\nCoordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9\u00b0 or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1&nbsp;km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this \"decimal\" unit failed to displace the \"sexagesimal\" units equilateral-vertex \u2013 degree \u2013 minute \u2013 second invented by Babylonian astronomers.{{POV inline|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Milliradian===\n[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating milliradian by hand]]\nThe [[milliradian]] (mrad) is an SI derived unit defined as one thousandth of a [[radian]], and has many useful purposes for measuring small angles.

The unit is equivalent to 216,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s ([[cumec]]s).<ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon River \u2013 Facts, History, Animals, & Map | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River | access-date=10 August 2019}}.</ref>\n\n=== Flow: Sverdrup ===\nOne [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[ocean current]]s.\n\n===Energy intensity===\nThe [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&nbsp;J/m<sup>2</sup> or \u22483.684 BTU/sq&nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.\n\n===Kinematic viscosity===\nOne of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s (\u22481.08\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/s).\n\n===Angular velocity===\n'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour \u2248 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].<ref>''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic flux===\nIn [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10<sup>\u221226</sup> [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10<sup>\u221226</sup>&nbsp;kg/s<sup>2</sup> in base units, about 8.8\u00d710<sup>\u221231</sup>&nbsp;BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.\n\n===Metre of water equivalent===\n{{main|Meter water equivalent}}\nA material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (\u224839.4&nbsp;in) of water.\n\nThis unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.\n\n===Strontium unit: radiation dose===\nThe [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&nbsp;S.U.\n\n===Banana equivalent dose===\n[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]\nBananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes\u2014even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s \u2013 in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 \u03bcSv.\n\n===Molar mass of cellulose===\nIn the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [\u03b7] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [\u03b7] = 0.070 M<sub>w</sub><sup>0.70</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038|pmid = 23398992|title = A re-investigation of the Mark\u2013Houwink\u2013Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry|journal = Journal of Chromatography A|volume = 1281|pages = 32\u201337|year = 2013|last1 = Kes|first1 = M\u00fcr\u015fide|last2 = Christensen|first2 = Bj\u00f8rn E.}}</ref> However, it is typical to cite [\u03b7] values directly in dL/g, as the \"viscosity\" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.\n\n===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===\nIn measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.\n\nIn pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.\n\n==Demography and epidemiology==\n[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as \"people\", \"births\", \"infections\" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|\"deaths per year\"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.\n\n[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.\n\n===Micromort===\n{{Main|Micromort}}\nA micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.\n\n===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===\n[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]\nThe large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people. For example, Uruguay's [[Estadio Centenario]] is often used in [[Uruguay]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Ahora la borrachera es \"previa\" a la fiesta | website=elpais.com.uy | date=15 October 2009 | url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015002051/http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-date=15 October 2009 | url-status=dead | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The unemployed would fill three and a half Centennial Stadiums (Spanish) | website=LARED21 | date=7 November 2002 | url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/97129-los-desocupados-colmarian-tres-y-medio-estadios-centenarios | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> while in parts of the United States, [[Michigan Stadium]] is used in this manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In Australia, the capacity of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (about 100,000) is often cited in this manner.

Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308162344/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nFor example: \"A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Computer and information science==\nThe growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.\n\n===Data volume===\n[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]\nVolume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nWhen the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version \u2013 Project Gutenberg|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.\n\nThe print version of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=7 December 2011|date=8 February 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref> so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.\n\nThe term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R.

The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. \"6-bit nibble\"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.\n\n===FLOPS===\n{{Main|FLOPS}}\nIn [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.\n\nIt is also used to compare the performance of computers in practice.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOP500 LIST November 2018 |url=https://top500.org/lists/2018/11/ |website=Top 500 |publisher=Top 500 |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== BogoMips ===\n{{Main|BogoMips}}\nA measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.\n\n===KLOC: computer program length===\nA computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for \"kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]\", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,<ref>{{cite web | title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part II | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part2.html | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure \"assembly equivalent lines of code\" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).\n\nError rates in programming are also measured in \"Errors per K-LOC\", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (>500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.\n\nAn alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the \"WaP\" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=April 2017 \u2013 \"How many WaPs is that?\" | website=Pegasus Mail and Mercury | date=30 November 2011 | url=http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ticks===\nThe \"tick\" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU.

[[James D. Hardy]], [[Herbert G. Wolff]], and [[Helen Goodell]] of [[Cornell University]] proposed the unit based on their studies of pain during the 1940s and 1950s. They defined one dol to equal to \"just noticeable differences\" ([[jnd]]'s) in pain. The unit never came into widespread use and other methods are now used to assess the level of pain experienced by patients.\n\nThe Schmidt sting pain index and Starr sting pain index are [[pain scale]]s rating the relative pain caused by different [[hymenoptera]]n stings. Schmidt has refined his [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]] (scaled from 1 to 4) with extensive anecdotal experience, culminating in a paper published in 1990 which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera.

It is normally used to measure the height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826125716/http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 August 2006 |title=Equestrian Federation of Australia National Measuring Scheme Effective from 1 January 2002 and amended in March 2002 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2002 |website=www.equestrian.org.au/ |publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.\n\n===Light-nanosecond===\nThe light-nanosecond is defined as exactly 29.9792458 [[centimetre|cm]]. It was popularized as a unit of distance by [[Grace Hopper]] as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 [[centimetre|cm]] or one [[foot (unit)|foot]]): \"The [[speed of light]] is one foot per nanosecond.\" In her speaking engagements, she was well known for passing out light-nanoseconds of wire to the audience, and contrasting it with light-microseconds (a coil of wire 1,000 times as long) and light-picoseconds (the size of ground [[black pepper]]). Over the course of her life, she found many uses for this visual aid, including demonstrating the waste of sub-optimal programming, illustrating advances in computer speed, and simply giving young scientists and policy makers the ability to conceptualize the magnitude of very large and small numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-story.html |title=Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper|date=4 May 2006 |publisher=US Navy}}</ref>\n\n===Metric foot===\nA [[metric foot]] (defined as 300&nbsp;mm, or about 11.8 inches) has been used occasionally in the UK<ref>{{cite web |  title=BBC TV Centre | website=History of Television Studios in London | url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm | quote=Measurements are in metric feet (30cm)...}}</ref> but has never been an official unit.\n\n===Horse===\n{{main|Horse length}}\nHorses are used to measure distances in [[horse racing]] \u2013 a ''horse length'' (shortened to merely a ''length'' when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=off|disp=or}}.

The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman. The [[Racing Rules of Sailing]] also makes heavy use of boat lengths.\n\n===Football field (length)===\n<!--American football field (unit) redirects here.

The field is {{convert|160|ft|yd m|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2015-nfl-rulebook#rule-1.-the-field|title=2015 NFL Rulebook}}</ref>\n\nA [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, including two {{convert|20|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones.\n\nMedia in the UK also use the [[association football pitch|football pitch]] as a unit of length, although the area of the [[association football]] pitch is not fixed, but may vary within limits of {{convert|90|-|120|m|yd|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|45|-|90|m|yd|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in width. The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\n===Block===\nA [[city block]] (in most US cities) is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement \"block\" usually refers to a north\u2013south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in places (like Manhattan)  with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east\u2013west and north\u2013south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east\u2013west plus the number north\u2013south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance}}</ref>\n\n===The Earth's circumference===\nThe circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator \"would circle the Earth four and a half times\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989}}</ref> According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40007862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40075016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft}}.\n\nThe metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.\n\n===Earth-to-Moon distance===\nThe distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end \"would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times\".\n\nThe abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is \"LD\" which stands for \"[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]\", used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.\n\n===Siriometer===\nThe [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].<!--Google test prefers US spelling-->\n\n==Area==\n===Barn===\n{{Main|Barn (unit)}}\nOne barn is 10<sup>\u221228</sup> square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus.

In dynastic China, the [[k\u00e8]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day \"weeks\". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.<ref>See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205531/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh |date=6 June 2011 }}, precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds. Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.\n\nIn addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].\n\n===Sol===\n{{main|Sol (day on Mars)}}\n{{further|Timekeeping on Mars}}\nThe United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a \"sol\"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88,775 SI seconds, or 2,375 seconds (about 39 minutes) longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system (instead of breaking down the sol into 25\u00d753\u00d767 or 25\u00d767\u00d753 SI second divisions) slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars; Martian hours, minutes and seconds are thus 2.75% longer than their SI-compatible counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Darian calendar]] is an arrangement of sols into a Martian year. It maintains a seven-sol week (retaining Sunday through Saturday naming customs), with four weeks to a month and 24 months to a Martian year, which contains 668 or 669 sols depending on [[leap year]]s. The last Saturday of every six months is skipped over in the Darian calendar.\n\n===Dog year===\n[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]\nThere are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a [[List of common misconceptions|popular myth]] regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.\n*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.<ref name=dogyear>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612143355/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)].

Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;\u2014 Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic year===\n{{Main|Galactic year}}\nThe galactic year, GY, is the time it takes the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core, approximately 250 million years ([[megaannum]] or \"Ma\"). It is a convenient unit for long-term measurements. For example, oceans appeared on Earth after 4&nbsp;GY, life is detectable at 5&nbsp;GY, and multicellular organisms first appeared at 15&nbsp;GY. The [[age of the Earth]] is estimated at about 20&nbsp;GY.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geologic Time Galactic |url=http://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/geologic_time_galactic/ |publisher=vendian.org |accessdate=19 December 2006}}</ref> This use of GY is not to be confused with Gyr for [[gigayear]] or Gy for [[Gray (unit)]].\n\n===KerMetric time===\nKerMetric time is a concept that divides the 24-hour day into 100 equal parts called Kermits. Each Kermit is equivalent to 14.4 minutes; the derivative math of (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour )/100. More precise time can be counted by dividing by 1000 or even 10000. The name Kermit came from a combination of the surname of the president of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 1983 (Dr. [[Larkin Kerwin]]). The original working model of KerMetric time as conceived by W. Thayer of NRC was assembled by the designated Clock Construction Team of John Phillips, Ron Hawkins, Les Moore and Willie Thayer in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/timemetricdispcalc3.html|title=KerMetric Time Display Calculator|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Moment ===\nA '''[[Moment (time)|moment]]''' '''was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] unit of time'''. The movement of a shadow on a [[sundial]] covered 40 moments in a [[Solar time|solar hour]]. An hour in this case meant one twelfth of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The length of a [[Solar time|solar hour]] depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the [[season]], so the length of a [[Moment (time)|moment]] in modern [[Second|seconds]] was not fixed, but '''on [[average]], a [[Moment (time)|moment]] corresponded to 90 seconds.'''\n\n===Thirds, Fourths===\n\nThe term \"[[Minute]]\" usually means {{frac|1|60}} of an [[hour]], coming from \"a minute division of an hour\". The term \"[[Second]]\" comes from \"the [[Second#Sexagesimal_divisions_of_calendar_time_and_day|second minute division]] of an hour\", as it's {{frac|1|60}} of a minute, or {{frac|1|60}} of {{frac|1|60}} of an hour. While usually sub-second units are represented with [[International_System_of_Units|SI]] prefixes on the second (e.g., [[millisecond|milliseconds]]), this system can be extrapolated further, such that a \"Third\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a second, and a \"Fourth\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a third, etc. These units are occasionally used in astronomy to denote angles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Herschel |first=William |authorlink= |year=1785 |title=Catalogue of Double Stars |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=75 |issue= |pages=40\u2013126 |jstor=106749 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0006 }}</ref>\n\n==Angular measure==\n===Furman===\nThe Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s. It is named for Alan T. Furman, the American mathematician who adapted the [[CORDIC]] algorithm for 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic sometime around 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Furman |first=Alan T. |title=The Cordic Algorithm for Fixed-Point Polar Geometry |url=http://www.forth.org/fd/FD-V04N1.pdf |journal=FORTH Dimensions |volume=4 |pages=14\u201315 |accessdate=16 January 2009 }}</ref> 16 bits give a resolution of 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 distinct angles.\n\n===Binary degree, binary radian, brad===\n{{See also|Binary scaling#Binary angles}}\nA related unit of angular measure equal to {{Frac|1|256}} of a circle, represented by 8 bits, has found some use in machinery control where fine precision is not required, most notably crankshaft and camshaft position in [[engine control unit|internal combustion engine controllers]], and in video game programming. There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation. Its value is equivalent to [[Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals|Tau]]/256 radians, or about 0.0245436926 radians.\n\n===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===\n{{Main|Grad (angle)}}\nCoordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9\u00b0 or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1&nbsp;km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this \"decimal\" unit failed to displace the \"sexagesimal\" units equilateral-vertex \u2013 degree \u2013 minute \u2013 second invented by Babylonian astronomers.{{POV inline|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Milliradian===\n[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating milliradian by hand]]\nThe [[milliradian]] (mrad) is an SI derived unit defined as one thousandth of a [[radian]], and has many useful purposes for measuring small angles. Milliradians are specifically used in optics for adjustment and range estimation, but also in general for measurement of small angles within science and technology.\n\nThe true milliradian (2000{{pi}} per [[Turn (angle)|turn]], or approximately 6283.18 per turn) must not be confused with variations such as the NATO mil (6400 per turn), the Swedish streck (6300 per turn) or the Warsaw Pact mil (6000 per turn), which are used by military organisations for range estimation and translate this map coordinates used for directing artillery fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collins Concise Dictionary of the English Language|date=1982|isbn=978-0-00-433091-4|editor-first=William T|editor-last=Macleod}}</ref>\n\n===MERU (Milli Earth Rate Unit)===\nThe '''MERU''', or Milli Earth Rate Unit, is an angular velocity equal to 1/1000 of Earth's [[sidereal time|rotation rate]].

One ton of TNT produces 4.184{{e|9}} joules, or (by arbitrary definition) exactly {{10^|9}} [[calorie|thermochemical calories]] (approximately 3.964{{e|6}} BTU). This definition is only loosely based on the actual physical properties of TNT.\n\n===Hiroshima bomb and Halifax explosion===\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiroshima bomb explosion]]\n[[File:Halifax Explosion blast cloud.jpg|thumb|upright|Halifax explosion]]\n{{Main|Moment magnitude scale#Nuclear explosions}}\nThe energy released by the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]] explosion (about 15&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 6{{e|13}}&nbsp;J) is often used by [[geologist]]s as a unit when describing the energy of [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, and [[impact event|asteroid impact]]s.\n\nPrior to the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, the size of the [[Halifax Explosion]] (about 3&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 1.26{{e|13}}&nbsp;J), was the standard for this type of relative measurement.

It is suitably large to quantify energy usage by nations or by the planet as whole using everyday numbers.  For example, in 2004, US energy consumption was about 100 Q/year, while demand worldwide was about 400 Q/year.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Basic Choices and Constraints on Long-Term Energy Supplies|date=July 2004 |journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=7|pages=47\u201352|doi=10.1063/1.1784302|last1=Weisz|first1=Paul B.|bibcode=2004PhT....57g..47W|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Foe===\nA [[Foe (unit)|foe]] is a unit of energy equal to {{10^|44}}&nbsp;[[joule]]s (\u22489.478{{e|40}} [[British thermal unit|BTU]]) that was coined by physicist Gerry Brown of [[Stony Brook University]]. To measure the staggeringly immense amount of energy produced by a [[supernova]], specialists occasionally use the \"foe\", an acronym derived from the phrase [ten to the power of] '''f'''ifty-'''o'''ne '''e'''rgs, or {{10^|51}}&nbsp;[[erg]]s. This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period of time (which can be measured in seconds).\n\n==Other metric-compatible scales==\n===Power: Ton of refrigeration===\n{{Main|Ton of refrigeration}}\nThe rate at which heat is removed by melting {{convert|1|ST|kg|spell=in}} of ice over twenty-four hours is referred to as a ton of refrigeration, or sometimes a ton of cooling. This unit of refrigeration capacity came from the days when large blocks of ice were used for cooling, and is still used to describe the heat-removal capabilities of refrigerators and chillers today. One ton of refrigeration is equal to 12,000 BTU/h exactly, or 3.517&nbsp;kW.\n\n===Flow: Amazon River===\nThe volume of discharge of the [[Amazon River]] sometimes used to describe large volumes of water flow such as ocean currents. The unit is equivalent to 216,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s ([[cumec]]s).<ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon River \u2013 Facts, History, Animals, & Map | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River | access-date=10 August 2019}}.</ref>\n\n=== Flow: Sverdrup ===\nOne [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[ocean current]]s.\n\n===Energy intensity===\nThe [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&nbsp;J/m<sup>2</sup> or \u22483.684 BTU/sq&nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.\n\n===Kinematic viscosity===\nOne of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s (\u22481.08\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/s).\n\n===Angular velocity===\n'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour \u2248 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].<ref>''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic flux===\nIn [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10<sup>\u221226</sup> [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10<sup>\u221226</sup>&nbsp;kg/s<sup>2</sup> in base units, about 8.8\u00d710<sup>\u221231</sup>&nbsp;BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.\n\n===Metre of water equivalent===\n{{main|Meter water equivalent}}\nA material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (\u224839.4&nbsp;in) of water.\n\nThis unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.\n\n===Strontium unit: radiation dose===\nThe [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&nbsp;S.U.\n\n===Banana equivalent dose===\n[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]\nBananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes\u2014even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s \u2013 in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 \u03bcSv.\n\n===Molar mass of cellulose===\nIn the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [\u03b7] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [\u03b7] = 0.070 M<sub>w</sub><sup>0.70</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038|pmid = 23398992|title = A re-investigation of the Mark\u2013Houwink\u2013Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry|journal = Journal of Chromatography A|volume = 1281|pages = 32\u201337|year = 2013|last1 = Kes|first1 = M\u00fcr\u015fide|last2 = Christensen|first2 = Bj\u00f8rn E.}}</ref> However, it is typical to cite [\u03b7] values directly in dL/g, as the \"viscosity\" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.\n\n===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===\nIn measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.\n\nIn pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.\n\n==Demography and epidemiology==\n[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as \"people\", \"births\", \"infections\" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|\"deaths per year\"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.\n\n[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.\n\n===Micromort===\n{{Main|Micromort}}\nA micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.\n\n===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===\n[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]\nThe large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people.

Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308162344/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nFor example: \"A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Computer and information science==\nThe growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.\n\n===Data volume===\n[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]\nVolume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nWhen the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version \u2013 Project Gutenberg|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.\n\nThe print version of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=7 December 2011|date=8 February 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref> so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.\n\nThe term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R.

The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. \"6-bit nibble\"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.\n\n===FLOPS===\n{{Main|FLOPS}}\nIn [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.\n\nIt is also used to compare the performance of computers in practice.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOP500 LIST November 2018 |url=https://top500.org/lists/2018/11/ |website=Top 500 |publisher=Top 500 |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== BogoMips ===\n{{Main|BogoMips}}\nA measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.\n\n===KLOC: computer program length===\nA computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for \"kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]\", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,<ref>{{cite web | title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part II | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part2.html | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure \"assembly equivalent lines of code\" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).\n\nError rates in programming are also measured in \"Errors per K-LOC\", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (>500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.\n\nAn alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the \"WaP\" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=April 2017 \u2013 \"How many WaPs is that?\" | website=Pegasus Mail and Mercury | date=30 November 2011 | url=http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ticks===\nThe \"tick\" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU.

In 1989, Fehlbaum had invited [[Frank Gehry]], then little-known, to build a design museum at the Vitra factory in [[Weil-am-Rhein]]. In 1993, he invited Hadid to design a small fire station for the factory. Her radical design, made of raw concrete and glass, was a sculptural work composed of sharp diagonal forms colliding together in the centre. The design plans appeared in architecture magazines before construction. When completed, it only served as a fire station for a short period of time, as Weil am Rhein soon opened their own fire station. It became an exhibit space instead, and is now on display with the works of Gehry and other well-known architects. It was the launching pad of her architectural career.{{Sfn|Taschen|2016|page=254}}\n\n===Bergisel Ski Jump (1999\u20132002)===\nHadid designed a public housing estate in Berlin (1986\u20131993) and organised an exhibition, \"The Great Utopia\" (1992), at the [[Guggenheim Museum]] in New York. Her next major project was a ski jump at Bergisel, in [[Innsbruck]] Austria. The old ski jump, built in 1926, had been used in the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics. The new structure was to contain not only a ski jump, but also a cafe with 150 seats offering a 360-degree view of the mountains. Hadid had to fight against traditionalists and against time; the project had to be completed in one year, before the next international competition. Her design is 48 metres high and rests on a base seven metres by seven metres. She described it as \"an organic hybrid\", a cross between a bridge and a tower, which by its form gives a sense of movement and speed.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=33}}\n\n===Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (1997\u20132000)===\nAt the end of the 1990s, her career began to gather momentum, as she won commissions for two museums and a large industrial building. She competed against [[Rem Koolhaas]] and other well-known architects for the design of the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] (1997\u20132000). She won, and became the first woman to design an art museum in the United States. At 8,500 square metres, the museum was not huge, and her design did not have the flamboyance of the [[Guggenheim Bilbao]] of [[Frank Gehry]], built at the same time. But the project demonstrated Hadid's ability to use architectural forms to create interior drama, including its central element, a 30-metre long black stairway that passes between massive curving and angular concrete walls.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=35}}\n\n===Phaeno Science Center (2000\u20132005)===\nIn 2000 she won an international competition for the [[Phaeno Science Center]],<ref name=PhaenoCCA>{{cite web |title=Zaha Hadid Architects Phaeno Science Centre project records |url=https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/archives/468014/zaha-hadid-architects-phaeno-science-centre-project-records |website=[[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany (2002\u20132005). The new museum was only a little larger than the Cincinnati Museum, with 9,000 square metres of space, but the plan was much more ambitious. It was similar in concept to the buildings of [[Le Corbusier]], raised up seven metres on concrete pylons. Unlike Corbusier's buildings, she planned for the space under the building to be filled with activity, and each of the 10 massive inverted cone-shaped columns that hold up the building contains a cafe, a shop, or a museum entrance. The tilting columns reach up through the building and also support the roof. The museum structure resembles an enormous ship, with sloping walls and asymmetric scatterings of windows, and the interior, with its angular columns and exposed steel roof framework, gives the illusion of being inside a working vessel or laboratory.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=37\u201339}}\n\n===Ordrupgaard Museum extension (2001\u20132005)===\nIn 2001 she began another museum project, an extension of the [[Ordrupgaard]] Museum near Copenhagen, Denmark, a museum featuring a collection of 19th century French and Danish art in the 19th-century mansion of its collector. The new building is 87 metres long and 20 metres wide, and is connected by a five-metre wide passage to the old museum. There are no right angles \u2013 only diagonals \u2013 in the concrete shell of the museum. The floor-to-ceiling glass walls of the gallery make the garden the backdrop of the exhibits.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=37\u201339}}\n\n===BMW Administration Building (2001\u20132005)===\nIn 2002 she won the competition to design a new administrative building for the factory of the auto manufacturer [[BMW]] in Leipzig, Germany. The three assembly buildings adjoining it were designed by other architects; her building served as the entrance and what she called the \"nerve centre\" of the complex. As with the [[Phaeno Science Center]], the building is hoisted above street level on leaning concrete pylons. The interior contains a series of levels and floors which seem to cascade, sheltered by tilting concrete beams and a roof supported by steel beams in the shape of an 'H'. The open interior inside was intended, she wrote, to avoid \"the traditional segregation of working groups\" and to show the \"global transparence of the internal organisation\" of the enterprise, and wrote that she had given particular attention to the parking lot in front of the building, with the intent, she wrote, of \"transforming it into a dynamic spectacle of its own\".{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=43}}\n\nIn 2004 she won the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]], the most prestigious award in architecture, though she had only completed four buildings \u2013 the Vitra Fire Station, the Ski Lift in Innsbruck Austria, the Car Park and Terminus Hoenheim North in France, and the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/2004|title=Selected Works: Zaha Hadid |publisher=Pritzker Architecture Prize|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> In making the announcement, [[Thomas Pritzker]], the head of the jury, announced: \"Although her body of work is relatively small, she has achieved great acclaim and her energy and ideas show even greater promise for the future.\"<ref name=pritzker>{{cite web|url=https://www.pritzkerprize.com/announcement-zaha-hadid|title=2004 Pritzker Prize announcement|publisher=Pritzker Architecture Prize|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Major projects (2006\u20132010)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n-Puente Zaragoza.jpg|[[Bridge Pavilion]] in [[Zaragoza]], Spain (2005\u20132008)\nFile:MAXXI ingresso 04.jpg|[[MAXXI]] Entrance, Rome, Italy (1998\u20132010)\nFile:MAXXI Museum interior 05.JPG|MAXXI Interior, Rome, Italy (1998\u20132010)\nFile:Guangzhou Opera House(Near).JPG|[[Guangzhou Opera House]], [[Guangzhou]], China (2003\u20132010)\n</gallery>\n\n===Zaragoza Bridge Pavilion (2005\u20132008)===\nBetween 1997 and 2010 Hadid ventured into the engineers' domain of bridge construction, a field also occupied by other top architects including [[Norman Foster]] and [[Santiago Calatrava]]. Between 2005 and 2008 she designed and built the Bridge-Pavilion of [[Zaragoza]], which was both an exhibit hall and a bridge, created for [[Expo 2008]], an event on the themes of water and durable development. The concrete bridge span on which the pavilion rests is 85 metres long measured from the Exposition site to an island in the Ebro River. The bridge carries or is attached to four tunnel-like exhibition spaces she termed \"pods\", which spread onto the island, for a total length of 275 metres. The pods are covered with a skin of 26,000 triangular shingles, many of which open to let in air and light. Like her other structures, the bridge-pavilion is composed entirely of diagonal slopes and curves, with no right-angles of orthogonal forms. By its curving shape and low profile, the bridge-pavilion fits smoothly into the grassy landscape along the river.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=51}}\n\n===[[Sheikh Zayed Bridge]] (1997\u20132010)===\n[[File:Sheikh Zayed Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|Sheikh Zayed Bridge]]\nBetween 1997 and 2010, she constructed a much more ambitious bridge, the [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Sheikh Zayed]] Bridge, which honors [[Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], between the island of [[Abu Dhabi]] and the [[Abu Dhabi Central Capital District|mainland of Abu Dhabi]], as well as to the [[Abu Dhabi International Airport]].

The total span of four lanes is {{convert|842|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, and also includes pedestrian walkways.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=53}}\n\n===National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI), Rome, Italy (1998\u20132010)===\nThe National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century ([[MAXXI]] for short), in Rome, was designed and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture is the sense of movement;  Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. Hadid took inspiration from the surrounding orthogonal site grids to determine the overall form. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=54\u201357}} Rowan Moore of ''The Guardian'' of London described its form as \"bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take you off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion.

The [[Guangzhou Opera House]] is located in a new business district of the city, with a new 103-storey glass tower behind it. It covers 70,000 square metres and was built at cost of US$300 million. The complex comprises an 1,800-seat theatre, a multipurpose theatre, entry hall, and salon. A covered pathway with restaurants and shops separates the two main structures. This building, like several of her later buildings, was inspired by natural earth forms; the architect herself referred to it as the \"two pebbles\". It appears akin to two giant smooth-edged boulders faced with 75,000 panels of polished granite and glass.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=59\u201360}} Edwin Heathcote, writing for the ''Financial Times'', noted Hadid's concentration on how her design could transform the urban landscape of Guangzhou, as the building rose as the centre of the new business area. He wrote in 2011 that Hadid \"produced a building that seems to suck the surrounding landscape into a vortex of movement and swirling space... appears both as alien object in a landscape of incomprehensible vastness (and often overwhelming banality), and as an extrusion of the peculiar nature of this landscape.\"<ref>Edwin Heathcote, ''Financial Times'', \"Zaha Hadid's Guangzhou opera house,\" 11 March 2011.</ref> Nicolai Ourousoff, architecture critic of the ''New York Times'', wrote that \"stepping into the main hall is like entering the soft insides of an oyster...The concave ceiling is pierced by thousands of little lights\u2014it looks like you're sitting under the dome of a clear night sky.\" Ourousoff noted that the finished building had construction problems: many of the granite tiles on the exterior had to be replaced, and the plaster and other interior work was poorly done by the inexperienced workers, but he praised Hadid's ability \"to convey a sense of bodies in motion\" and called the building \"a Chinese gem that elevates its setting.\"<ref name=\"gem\">{{cite news|author=Nicolai Ouroussoff|title=Chinese Gem That Elevates Its Setting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/arts/design/guangzhou-opera-house-designed-by-zaha-hadid-review.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=22 December 2018|author-link=Nicolai Ouroussoff}}</ref>\n\n==Major projects  (2011\u20132012)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Riverside museum from front.jpeg|[[Riverside Museum]], Glasgow, Scotland (2004\u20132011)\nFile:London Olympic Aquatic Centre (1).jpg|[[London Aquatics Centre]], built for the 2012 Summer Olympics, London (2005\u20132012)\nFile:MSU Broad Art Museum exterior 1.jpg|[[Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum|Broad Art Museum]] in [[East Lansing]], Michigan, US (2007\u20132012)\nFile:Galaxy Soho.jpg|[[Galaxy SOHO]] in Beijing, China (2008\u20132012)\n</gallery>\n\n===Riverside Museum, Glasgow, Scotland  (2004\u20132011)===\n[[File:Riverside Museum roof swirl 02.png|thumb|172x172px]]\nThe [[Riverside Museum]] (2004\u20132011), on the banks of the [[River Clyde]] [[Glasgow, Scotland]], houses the [[Glasgow Museum of Transport]]. Hadid described the 10,000-square metre building, with 7,000 square metres of gallery space, as \"a wave\", \"folds in movement\", and \"a shed in the form of a tunnel, open at the extreme ends, one end toward the city and the other toward the Clyde.\"{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=65}} Like many of her buildings, the whole form is only perceived when viewed from above. The facades are covered with [[zinc]] plates, and the roofline has a series of peaks and angles. The interior galleries caused some controversy; visitors who came to see the collection of historic automobiles found that they are mounted on the walls, high overhead, so it is impossible to look into them. Rowan Moore of  ''The Guardian'' of London wrote: \"Obviously the space is about movement...Outside it is, typologically, a supermarket, being a big thing in a parking lot that is seeking to attract you in...It has enigma and majesty, but not friendliness.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/12/zaha-hadid-glasgow-architecture-review|title=Riverside Museum of Transport and Travel, Glasgow \u2013 a review|author=Rowan Moore|work=The Observer/The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===London Olympics Aquatics Centre (2005\u20132011)===\nHadid described her [[London Aquatics Centre|Aquatics Centre]] for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London as \"inspired by the fluid geometry of water in movement\".{{Sfn|Jodidio|2017|page=69}} The building covers three swimming pools, and seats 17,500 spectators at the two main pools. The roof, made of steel and aluminium and covered with wood on the inside, rests on just three supports;  it is in the form of a parabolic arch which dips in the centre, with the two pools at either end. The seats are placed in bays beside the curving and outward-leaning walls of glass. At \u00a3269 million, the complex cost three times the original estimate, owing principally to the complexity of the roof. This was the subject of much comment when it was constructed, and it was the first 2012 Olympic building begun but the last to be finished. It was praised by architecture critics. [[Rowan Moore]] of ''The Guardian'' said that the roof \"floats and undulates\" and called the centre \"the Olympics' most majestic space\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/31/london-olympics-aquatic-hadid-review|title=Olympics Aquatic Center \u2013 review|author=Rowan Moore|work=The Observer/The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=30 July 2011|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Broad Art Museum, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, US (2007\u20132012) ===\nThe [[Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum|Broad Art Museum]] at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], Hadid's second project in the United States, has a space of 4,274 square metres, dedicated to contemporary art and modern art and an historical collection. The parallelogram-shaped building leans sharply and seems about to tip over. Hadid wrote that she designed the building so that its sloping pleated stainless steel facades would reflect the surrounding neighbourhood from different angles;  the building continually changes colour depending upon the weather, the time of day and the angle of the sun. As Hadid commented, the building \"awakens curiosity without ever truly revealing its contents\".{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=74}} Elaine Glusac of ''The New York Times'' wrote that the architecture of the new museum \"radicalizes the streetscape\".<ref>Elaine Glusac, ''New York Times'', June 3, 2014</ref> The Museum was used in a scene of the 2016 Batman vs. Superman movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcEROipMv5k|work=[[Michigan State University]]|date=March 2016|title=MSU & \"Batman v Superman: The Broad Art Museum\"|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Galaxy SOHO, Beijing, China (2008\u20132012)===\nMany of Hadid's later major works are found in Asia. The [[Galaxy SOHO]] in Beijing, China (2008\u20132012) is a combination of offices and a commercial centre in the heart of Beijing with a total of 332,857 square metres, composed of four different ovoid glass-capped buildings joined together by multiple curving passageways on different levels.

No straight line was used in the project of the complex. The shape of the building is wave-like and the overall view is unique and harmonic. Such an architectural structure stands for post-modernist architecture and forms oceanic feeling. The lines of the building symbolise the merging of past and future.\n\n===Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Seoul, Korea (2007\u20132013)===\nThe [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]] (2007\u20132013) is among the largest buildings in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. Its name means \"Great Gate of the East\", in reference to the old walls of the city. The complex of 86,574 square metres contains exhibition space, a museum of design, conference rooms and other common facilities, as well as the bureaux and a marketplace for designers which is open 24 hours a day. The main building is 280 metres long with seven levels, including three levels underground. The smooth-skinned, giant mushroom-like structure floating atop sloping pylons is made of concrete, aluminium, steel and stone on the exterior, and finished inside with plaster reinforced with synthetic fibre, acoustic tiles, acrylic resin, and stainless steel and polished stone on the interior. Hadid wrote that the principal characteristics of her design were \"transparency, porousness, and durability.\" It also features many ecological features, including a double skin, solar panels, and a system for recycling water.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=83}}\n\n===Library and Learning Center, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria (2008\u20132013)===\nThe Library and Learning Center was designed as the centrepiece of the new University of Economics in Vienna. Containing 28,000 square metres of space, its distinctive Hadid features include walls sloping at 35 degrees and massive black volume cantilevered at an angle over the plaza in front of the building. She described the interior as follows: \"The straight lines of the building's exterior separate as they move inward, becoming curvilinear and fluid to generate a free-formed interior canyon that serves as the principal public plaza of the Center, as well as generating corridors and bridges ensuring smooth transitions between different levels.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archdaily.com/523598/library-and-learning-centre-university-of-economics-vienna-zaha-hadid-architects|title=Library and Learning Centre of the University of Economics, Vienna / Zaha Hadid Architects|work=Architecture Daily|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Innovation Tower, Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2007\u20132014)===\nThe [[Innovation Tower]] in Hong Kong (2007\u20132014) is part of [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]. The building of 15 floors has 15,000 square metres of space, with laboratories, classrooms, studios and other facilities for 1,800 students and their faculty. It was built on the site of the university's former football pitch. The extremely complex forms of the building required computer modelling. Early designs experimented with a facade made of reinforced plastic, textiles or aluminium, but Hadid finally settled upon metal panels with multiple layers. The building seems to lean towards the city. The floors inside are visible from the exterior like geological strata.{{Sfn|Jodido|2016|page=85}}\n\n===Wangjing SOHO Tower, Beijing (2009\u20132014)===\n[[Wangjing SOHO|Wangjing SOHO tower]] in Beijing is the second building Hadid designed for the major Chinese property developer, located half-way between the centre of Beijing and the airport. The towers slope and curve; Hadid compared them to Chinese fans, \"whose volumes turn one around the other in a complex ballet.\" The tallest building is 200 metres high, with two levels of shops and 37 levels of offices. A single atrium level three storeys high joins the three buildings at the base.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=87}}\n\n=== Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre (2012-2015) ===\nThe Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre are two [[skyscraper]]s in [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]], [[China]].

Construction began in 2012 and ended in 2015.\n\n===Port Authority, Antwerp, Belgium (2016)===\nOf all her works, Hadid designed only one government building, the [[Port Authority Building (Antwerp)|Port Authority Building]], or Havenhuis, in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], completed in 2016. Most new government buildings attempt to express solidity and seriousness, but Port Authority, a ship-like structure of glass and steel on a white concrete perch, seems to have landed atop the old port building constructed in 1922.

She earned her early reputation with her lecturing and colourful and radical early designs and projects, which were widely published in architectural journals but remained largely unbuilt. Her ambitious but unbuilt projects included a plan for Peak in Hong Kong (1983), and a plan for an [[Cardiff Bay Opera House|opera house in Cardiff]], Wales, (1994). The Cardiff experience was particularly discouraging; her design was chosen as the best by the competition jury, but the Welsh government refused to pay for it, and the commission was given to a different and less ambitious architect.<ref>Nicolai Ourousoff, ''The New York Times'', 5 July 2011.

In 1989, Fehlbaum had invited [[Frank Gehry]], then little-known, to build a design museum at the Vitra factory in [[Weil-am-Rhein]]. In 1993, he invited Hadid to design a small fire station for the factory. Her radical design, made of raw concrete and glass, was a sculptural work composed of sharp diagonal forms colliding together in the centre. The design plans appeared in architecture magazines before construction. When completed, it only served as a fire station for a short period of time, as Weil am Rhein soon opened their own fire station. It became an exhibit space instead, and is now on display with the works of Gehry and other well-known architects. It was the launching pad of her architectural career.{{Sfn|Taschen|2016|page=254}}\n\n===Bergisel Ski Jump (1999\u20132002)===\nHadid designed a public housing estate in Berlin (1986\u20131993) and organised an exhibition, \"The Great Utopia\" (1992), at the [[Guggenheim Museum]] in New York. Her next major project was a ski jump at Bergisel, in [[Innsbruck]] Austria. The old ski jump, built in 1926, had been used in the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics. The new structure was to contain not only a ski jump, but also a cafe with 150 seats offering a 360-degree view of the mountains. Hadid had to fight against traditionalists and against time; the project had to be completed in one year, before the next international competition. Her design is 48 metres high and rests on a base seven metres by seven metres. She described it as \"an organic hybrid\", a cross between a bridge and a tower, which by its form gives a sense of movement and speed.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=33}}\n\n===Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (1997\u20132000)===\nAt the end of the 1990s, her career began to gather momentum, as she won commissions for two museums and a large industrial building. She competed against [[Rem Koolhaas]] and other well-known architects for the design of the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] (1997\u20132000). She won, and became the first woman to design an art museum in the United States. At 8,500 square metres, the museum was not huge, and her design did not have the flamboyance of the [[Guggenheim Bilbao]] of [[Frank Gehry]], built at the same time. But the project demonstrated Hadid's ability to use architectural forms to create interior drama, including its central element, a 30-metre long black stairway that passes between massive curving and angular concrete walls.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=35}}\n\n===Phaeno Science Center (2000\u20132005)===\nIn 2000 she won an international competition for the [[Phaeno Science Center]],<ref name=PhaenoCCA>{{cite web |title=Zaha Hadid Architects Phaeno Science Centre project records |url=https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/archives/468014/zaha-hadid-architects-phaeno-science-centre-project-records |website=[[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany (2002\u20132005). The new museum was only a little larger than the Cincinnati Museum, with 9,000 square metres of space, but the plan was much more ambitious. It was similar in concept to the buildings of [[Le Corbusier]], raised up seven metres on concrete pylons. Unlike Corbusier's buildings, she planned for the space under the building to be filled with activity, and each of the 10 massive inverted cone-shaped columns that hold up the building contains a cafe, a shop, or a museum entrance. The tilting columns reach up through the building and also support the roof. The museum structure resembles an enormous ship, with sloping walls and asymmetric scatterings of windows, and the interior, with its angular columns and exposed steel roof framework, gives the illusion of being inside a working vessel or laboratory.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=37\u201339}}\n\n===Ordrupgaard Museum extension (2001\u20132005)===\nIn 2001 she began another museum project, an extension of the [[Ordrupgaard]] Museum near Copenhagen, Denmark, a museum featuring a collection of 19th century French and Danish art in the 19th-century mansion of its collector. The new building is 87 metres long and 20 metres wide, and is connected by a five-metre wide passage to the old museum. There are no right angles \u2013 only diagonals \u2013 in the concrete shell of the museum. The floor-to-ceiling glass walls of the gallery make the garden the backdrop of the exhibits.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=37\u201339}}\n\n===BMW Administration Building (2001\u20132005)===\nIn 2002 she won the competition to design a new administrative building for the factory of the auto manufacturer [[BMW]] in Leipzig, Germany. The three assembly buildings adjoining it were designed by other architects; her building served as the entrance and what she called the \"nerve centre\" of the complex. As with the [[Phaeno Science Center]], the building is hoisted above street level on leaning concrete pylons. The interior contains a series of levels and floors which seem to cascade, sheltered by tilting concrete beams and a roof supported by steel beams in the shape of an 'H'. The open interior inside was intended, she wrote, to avoid \"the traditional segregation of working groups\" and to show the \"global transparence of the internal organisation\" of the enterprise, and wrote that she had given particular attention to the parking lot in front of the building, with the intent, she wrote, of \"transforming it into a dynamic spectacle of its own\".{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=43}}\n\nIn 2004 she won the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]], the most prestigious award in architecture, though she had only completed four buildings \u2013 the Vitra Fire Station, the Ski Lift in Innsbruck Austria, the Car Park and Terminus Hoenheim North in France, and the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/2004|title=Selected Works: Zaha Hadid |publisher=Pritzker Architecture Prize|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> In making the announcement, [[Thomas Pritzker]], the head of the jury, announced: \"Although her body of work is relatively small, she has achieved great acclaim and her energy and ideas show even greater promise for the future.\"<ref name=pritzker>{{cite web|url=https://www.pritzkerprize.com/announcement-zaha-hadid|title=2004 Pritzker Prize announcement|publisher=Pritzker Architecture Prize|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Major projects (2006\u20132010)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n-Puente Zaragoza.jpg|[[Bridge Pavilion]] in [[Zaragoza]], Spain (2005\u20132008)\nFile:MAXXI ingresso 04.jpg|[[MAXXI]] Entrance, Rome, Italy (1998\u20132010)\nFile:MAXXI Museum interior 05.JPG|MAXXI Interior, Rome, Italy (1998\u20132010)\nFile:Guangzhou Opera House(Near).JPG|[[Guangzhou Opera House]], [[Guangzhou]], China (2003\u20132010)\n</gallery>\n\n===Zaragoza Bridge Pavilion (2005\u20132008)===\nBetween 1997 and 2010 Hadid ventured into the engineers' domain of bridge construction, a field also occupied by other top architects including [[Norman Foster]] and [[Santiago Calatrava]]. Between 2005 and 2008 she designed and built the Bridge-Pavilion of [[Zaragoza]], which was both an exhibit hall and a bridge, created for [[Expo 2008]], an event on the themes of water and durable development. The concrete bridge span on which the pavilion rests is 85 metres long measured from the Exposition site to an island in the Ebro River. The bridge carries or is attached to four tunnel-like exhibition spaces she termed \"pods\", which spread onto the island, for a total length of 275 metres. The pods are covered with a skin of 26,000 triangular shingles, many of which open to let in air and light. Like her other structures, the bridge-pavilion is composed entirely of diagonal slopes and curves, with no right-angles of orthogonal forms. By its curving shape and low profile, the bridge-pavilion fits smoothly into the grassy landscape along the river.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=51}}\n\n===[[Sheikh Zayed Bridge]] (1997\u20132010)===\n[[File:Sheikh Zayed Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|Sheikh Zayed Bridge]]\nBetween 1997 and 2010, she constructed a much more ambitious bridge, the [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Sheikh Zayed]] Bridge, which honors [[Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], between the island of [[Abu Dhabi]] and the [[Abu Dhabi Central Capital District|mainland of Abu Dhabi]], as well as to the [[Abu Dhabi International Airport]].

The silhouette of the bridge is a wave, with a principal arch 235 metres long, standing 60 metres above the water. The total span of four lanes is {{convert|842|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, and also includes pedestrian walkways.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=53}}\n\n===National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI), Rome, Italy (1998\u20132010)===\nThe National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century ([[MAXXI]] for short), in Rome, was designed and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture is the sense of movement;  Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. Hadid took inspiration from the surrounding orthogonal site grids to determine the overall form. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=54\u201357}} Rowan Moore of ''The Guardian'' of London described its form as \"bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void.

The [[Guangzhou Opera House]] is located in a new business district of the city, with a new 103-storey glass tower behind it. It covers 70,000 square metres and was built at cost of US$300 million. The complex comprises an 1,800-seat theatre, a multipurpose theatre, entry hall, and salon. A covered pathway with restaurants and shops separates the two main structures. This building, like several of her later buildings, was inspired by natural earth forms; the architect herself referred to it as the \"two pebbles\". It appears akin to two giant smooth-edged boulders faced with 75,000 panels of polished granite and glass.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=59\u201360}} Edwin Heathcote, writing for the ''Financial Times'', noted Hadid's concentration on how her design could transform the urban landscape of Guangzhou, as the building rose as the centre of the new business area. He wrote in 2011 that Hadid \"produced a building that seems to suck the surrounding landscape into a vortex of movement and swirling space... appears both as alien object in a landscape of incomprehensible vastness (and often overwhelming banality), and as an extrusion of the peculiar nature of this landscape.\"<ref>Edwin Heathcote, ''Financial Times'', \"Zaha Hadid's Guangzhou opera house,\" 11 March 2011.</ref> Nicolai Ourousoff, architecture critic of the ''New York Times'', wrote that \"stepping into the main hall is like entering the soft insides of an oyster...The concave ceiling is pierced by thousands of little lights\u2014it looks like you're sitting under the dome of a clear night sky.\" Ourousoff noted that the finished building had construction problems: many of the granite tiles on the exterior had to be replaced, and the plaster and other interior work was poorly done by the inexperienced workers, but he praised Hadid's ability \"to convey a sense of bodies in motion\" and called the building \"a Chinese gem that elevates its setting.\"<ref name=\"gem\">{{cite news|author=Nicolai Ouroussoff|title=Chinese Gem That Elevates Its Setting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/arts/design/guangzhou-opera-house-designed-by-zaha-hadid-review.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=22 December 2018|author-link=Nicolai Ouroussoff}}</ref>\n\n==Major projects  (2011\u20132012)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Riverside museum from front.jpeg|[[Riverside Museum]], Glasgow, Scotland (2004\u20132011)\nFile:London Olympic Aquatic Centre (1).jpg|[[London Aquatics Centre]], built for the 2012 Summer Olympics, London (2005\u20132012)\nFile:MSU Broad Art Museum exterior 1.jpg|[[Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum|Broad Art Museum]] in [[East Lansing]], Michigan, US (2007\u20132012)\nFile:Galaxy Soho.jpg|[[Galaxy SOHO]] in Beijing, China (2008\u20132012)\n</gallery>\n\n===Riverside Museum, Glasgow, Scotland  (2004\u20132011)===\n[[File:Riverside Museum roof swirl 02.png|thumb|172x172px]]\nThe [[Riverside Museum]] (2004\u20132011), on the banks of the [[River Clyde]] [[Glasgow, Scotland]], houses the [[Glasgow Museum of Transport]]. Hadid described the 10,000-square metre building, with 7,000 square metres of gallery space, as \"a wave\", \"folds in movement\", and \"a shed in the form of a tunnel, open at the extreme ends, one end toward the city and the other toward the Clyde.\"{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=65}} Like many of her buildings, the whole form is only perceived when viewed from above. The facades are covered with [[zinc]] plates, and the roofline has a series of peaks and angles. The interior galleries caused some controversy; visitors who came to see the collection of historic automobiles found that they are mounted on the walls, high overhead, so it is impossible to look into them. Rowan Moore of  ''The Guardian'' of London wrote: \"Obviously the space is about movement...Outside it is, typologically, a supermarket, being a big thing in a parking lot that is seeking to attract you in...It has enigma and majesty, but not friendliness.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/12/zaha-hadid-glasgow-architecture-review|title=Riverside Museum of Transport and Travel, Glasgow \u2013 a review|author=Rowan Moore|work=The Observer/The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===London Olympics Aquatics Centre (2005\u20132011)===\nHadid described her [[London Aquatics Centre|Aquatics Centre]] for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London as \"inspired by the fluid geometry of water in movement\".{{Sfn|Jodidio|2017|page=69}} The building covers three swimming pools, and seats 17,500 spectators at the two main pools. The roof, made of steel and aluminium and covered with wood on the inside, rests on just three supports;  it is in the form of a parabolic arch which dips in the centre, with the two pools at either end. The seats are placed in bays beside the curving and outward-leaning walls of glass. At \u00a3269 million, the complex cost three times the original estimate, owing principally to the complexity of the roof. This was the subject of much comment when it was constructed, and it was the first 2012 Olympic building begun but the last to be finished. It was praised by architecture critics. [[Rowan Moore]] of ''The Guardian'' said that the roof \"floats and undulates\" and called the centre \"the Olympics' most majestic space\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/31/london-olympics-aquatic-hadid-review|title=Olympics Aquatic Center \u2013 review|author=Rowan Moore|work=The Observer/The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=30 July 2011|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Broad Art Museum, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, US (2007\u20132012) ===\nThe [[Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum|Broad Art Museum]] at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], Hadid's second project in the United States, has a space of 4,274 square metres, dedicated to contemporary art and modern art and an historical collection. The parallelogram-shaped building leans sharply and seems about to tip over. Hadid wrote that she designed the building so that its sloping pleated stainless steel facades would reflect the surrounding neighbourhood from different angles;  the building continually changes colour depending upon the weather, the time of day and the angle of the sun. As Hadid commented, the building \"awakens curiosity without ever truly revealing its contents\".{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=74}} Elaine Glusac of ''The New York Times'' wrote that the architecture of the new museum \"radicalizes the streetscape\".<ref>Elaine Glusac, ''New York Times'', June 3, 2014</ref> The Museum was used in a scene of the 2016 Batman vs. Superman movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcEROipMv5k|work=[[Michigan State University]]|date=March 2016|title=MSU & \"Batman v Superman: The Broad Art Museum\"|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Galaxy SOHO, Beijing, China (2008\u20132012)===\nMany of Hadid's later major works are found in Asia. The [[Galaxy SOHO]] in Beijing, China (2008\u20132012) is a combination of offices and a commercial centre in the heart of Beijing with a total of 332,857 square metres, composed of four different ovoid glass-capped buildings joined together by multiple curving passageways on different levels. Hadid explained, \"the interior spaces follow the same coherent formal logic of continual curvilinearity.\" The complex, like most of her buildings, gives the impression that every part of them is in motion.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=77}}\n\n==Last completed major projects  (2013\u20132016)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center.jpg|[[Heydar Aliyev Center]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] (2007\u20132013)\nFile:\u201cAr\u015f\u0131n mal alan\u201d filminin r\u0259ngli formatda premyeras\u0131.jpg|Auditorium of the [[Heydar Aliyev Center]]\nFile:Campus WU LC D1 TC DSC 1440w.jpg|[[Vienna University of Economics and Business]] Library and Learning Center, Vienna, Austria (2013)\nFile:WU Wien, Library & Learning Center, Zaha Hadid 2.JPG|Interior of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]] Library and Learning Center (2013)\nFile:Dongdaemun Design Plaza at night, Seoul, Korea.jpg|[[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]], [[Seoul]], [[Korea]] (2007\u20132013)\nFile:Dongdaemun Design Plaza.jpg|[[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]] from ground level\nFile:Wangjing Soho by Zaha Hadid.jpg|The [[Wangjing SOHO]] office complex in [[Beijing]], China (2009\u20132014)\nFile:Wikimania 2013 04404.JPG|Jockey Club [[Innovation Tower]] at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] (2007\u20132014)\nFile:Youth Olympics Towers, Nanjing (Aug 2014).png|Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre, 2015 \nFile:Antwerpen Havenhuis 5.jpg|[[Port Authority Building (Antwerp)|Port Authority Building (Havenhuis)]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] (2016) \n</gallery>\n\n===Heydar Aliyev Center, Baku Azerbaijan (2007\u20132013)===\nThe [[Heydar Aliyev Center]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] (2007\u20132013) is a gigantic cultural and conference centre containing three auditoriums, a library and museum, with a total space of 10,801 square metres on a surface of 15,514 square metres, and a height of 74 metres. Hadid wrote that \"its fluid form emerges from the folds of the natural topography of the landscape and envelops the different functions of the centre\",  though the building when completed was largely surrounded by Soviet-era apartment blocks.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|pages=79\u201381}} Peter Cook in ''Architectural Review'' called it \"a white vision, outrageously total, arrogantly complete&nbsp;... a unique object that confounds and contradicts the reasonable&nbsp;... a wave form sweeping up, almost lunging, into the sky&nbsp;... here is architecture as the ultimate statement of theatre&nbsp;...

No straight line was used in the project of the complex. The shape of the building is wave-like and the overall view is unique and harmonic. Such an architectural structure stands for post-modernist architecture and forms oceanic feeling. The lines of the building symbolise the merging of past and future.\n\n===Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Seoul, Korea (2007\u20132013)===\nThe [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]] (2007\u20132013) is among the largest buildings in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. Its name means \"Great Gate of the East\", in reference to the old walls of the city. The complex of 86,574 square metres contains exhibition space, a museum of design, conference rooms and other common facilities, as well as the bureaux and a marketplace for designers which is open 24 hours a day. The main building is 280 metres long with seven levels, including three levels underground. The smooth-skinned, giant mushroom-like structure floating atop sloping pylons is made of concrete, aluminium, steel and stone on the exterior, and finished inside with plaster reinforced with synthetic fibre, acoustic tiles, acrylic resin, and stainless steel and polished stone on the interior. Hadid wrote that the principal characteristics of her design were \"transparency, porousness, and durability.\" It also features many ecological features, including a double skin, solar panels, and a system for recycling water.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=83}}\n\n===Library and Learning Center, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria (2008\u20132013)===\nThe Library and Learning Center was designed as the centrepiece of the new University of Economics in Vienna. Containing 28,000 square metres of space, its distinctive Hadid features include walls sloping at 35 degrees and massive black volume cantilevered at an angle over the plaza in front of the building. She described the interior as follows: \"The straight lines of the building's exterior separate as they move inward, becoming curvilinear and fluid to generate a free-formed interior canyon that serves as the principal public plaza of the Center, as well as generating corridors and bridges ensuring smooth transitions between different levels.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archdaily.com/523598/library-and-learning-centre-university-of-economics-vienna-zaha-hadid-architects|title=Library and Learning Centre of the University of Economics, Vienna / Zaha Hadid Architects|work=Architecture Daily|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Innovation Tower, Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2007\u20132014)===\nThe [[Innovation Tower]] in Hong Kong (2007\u20132014) is part of [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]. The building of 15 floors has 15,000 square metres of space, with laboratories, classrooms, studios and other facilities for 1,800 students and their faculty. It was built on the site of the university's former football pitch. The extremely complex forms of the building required computer modelling. Early designs experimented with a facade made of reinforced plastic, textiles or aluminium, but Hadid finally settled upon metal panels with multiple layers. The building seems to lean towards the city. The floors inside are visible from the exterior like geological strata.{{Sfn|Jodido|2016|page=85}}\n\n===Wangjing SOHO Tower, Beijing (2009\u20132014)===\n[[Wangjing SOHO|Wangjing SOHO tower]] in Beijing is the second building Hadid designed for the major Chinese property developer, located half-way between the centre of Beijing and the airport. The towers slope and curve; Hadid compared them to Chinese fans, \"whose volumes turn one around the other in a complex ballet.\" The tallest building is 200 metres high, with two levels of shops and 37 levels of offices. A single atrium level three storeys high joins the three buildings at the base.{{Sfn|Jodidio|2016|page=87}}\n\n=== Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre (2012-2015) ===\nThe Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre are two [[skyscraper]]s in [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]], [[China]].

Construction began in 2012 and ended in 2015.\n\n===Port Authority, Antwerp, Belgium (2016)===\nOf all her works, Hadid designed only one government building, the [[Port Authority Building (Antwerp)|Port Authority Building]], or Havenhuis, in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], completed in 2016. Most new government buildings attempt to express solidity and seriousness, but Port Authority, a ship-like structure of glass and steel on a white concrete perch, seems to have landed atop the old port building constructed in 1922. The faceted glass structure also resembles a diamond, a symbol of Antwerp's role as the major market of diamonds in Europe. It was one of the last works of Hadid, who died in 2016, the year it opened. The square in front of the building was renamed to Zaha Hadidplein (Zaha Hadidsquare) to honor her death.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Zaha Hadid Grave Brookwood Cemetery.jpg|thumb|140px|right|The grave of Zaha Hadid (centre) in [[Brookwood Cemetery]]]]\nOn 31 March 2016, Hadid died of a heart attack in a [[Mount Sinai Medical Center & Miami Heart Institute|Miami hospital]], where she was being treated for [[bronchitis]].<ref name=\"BBC310316\">{{cite news|title=Architect Dame Zaha Hadid dies after heart attack|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35936768|accessdate=22 December 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=31 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://architectureau.com/articles/zaha-hadid-dies-aged-65/|title='Formidable' Zaha Hadid dies, aged 65|last=Editorial Desk|date=1 April 2016|website=ArchitectureAU|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe statement issued by her London-based design studio announcing her death read: \"Zaha Hadid was widely regarded to be the greatest female architect in the world today\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/iraqi-british-architect-zaha-hadid-dies-65-160331152121266.html|author=Ted Regencia|title=Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid dies at 65|agency=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=31 March 2016|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> She is buried between her father [[Mohammed Hadid]] and brother [[Foulath Hadid]] in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in [[Brookwood, Surrey]], England.<ref>Henry H Kuehn (2017). \"Architects' Gravesites: A Serendipitous Guide\". p. 43.

She won the competition for the building in 2000, but then the project was delayed due to funding and technical issues. Hadid scouted the site from a police boat in the harbour to visualise how it would appear from the water. The final building covers 50,000 square feet and cost 15 million Euros. Paola Cattarin, the project architect who completed the building after Hadid's death, said, \"We thought of the building as an oyster, with a hard shell top and bottom, and a softer, liquid, more organic interior.\" At the opening of the new building, posters of Hadid were placed around the city, saying, \"Goodbye Zaha Hadid; Genius and Modernity, Inspiration and Transformation, Light That Takes Shape.\"<ref>Review by Joseph Giovannini, ''New York Times'', 26 April 2016.</ref>\n\n===Scorpion Tower of Miami===\nThe Scorpion Tower of Miami, now known as [[One Thousand Museum]], was started while Hadid was still alive though currently undergoing completion posthumously.

The Wolverines joined the [[Big Ten Conference]] at its inception in 1896, and other than a [[Charles A. Baird#1906 season and withdrawal from the Western Conference|hiatus from 1907 to 1916]], have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the [[AP Poll]] in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]], most recently that of the [[1997 Michigan Wolverines football team|1997 squad]] voted atop the final AP Poll.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1989, Michigan was led by a series of nine head coaches, each of whom has been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] either as a player or as a coach. [[Fielding H. Yost]] became Michigan's head coach in 1901 and guided his \"Point-a-Minute\" squads to a streak of 56 games without a defeat, spanning from his arrival until the season finale in 1905, including a victory in the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], the first college football [[bowl game]] ever played. [[Fritz Crisler]] brought his winged helmet from [[Princeton University]] in 1938 and led the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Wolverines]] to a national title and Michigan's [[1948 Rose Bowl|second Rose Bowl win]]. [[Bo Schembechler]] coached the team for 21 seasons (1969\u20131989) in which he won 13 Big Ten titles and 194 games, a program record.

The Wolverines joined the [[Big Ten Conference]] at its inception in 1896, and other than a [[Charles A. Baird#1906 season and withdrawal from the Western Conference|hiatus from 1907 to 1916]], have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the [[AP Poll]] in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]], most recently that of the [[1997 Michigan Wolverines football team|1997 squad]] voted atop the final AP Poll.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1989, Michigan was led by a series of nine head coaches, each of whom has been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] either as a player or as a coach. [[Fielding H. Yost]] became Michigan's head coach in 1901 and guided his \"Point-a-Minute\" squads to a streak of 56 games without a defeat, spanning from his arrival until the season finale in 1905, including a victory in the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], the first college football [[bowl game]] ever played. [[Fritz Crisler]] brought his winged helmet from [[Princeton University]] in 1938 and led the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Wolverines]] to a national title and Michigan's [[1948 Rose Bowl|second Rose Bowl win]]. [[Bo Schembechler]] coached the team for 21 seasons (1969\u20131989) in which he won 13 Big Ten titles and 194 games, a program record. The first decade of his tenure was underscored by a fierce competition with his former mentor, [[Woody Hayes]], whose [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] squared off against Schembechler's Wolverines in a stretch of the Michigan\u2013Ohio State rivalry dubbed the \"Ten-Year War\".\n\nFollowing Schembechler's retirement, the program was coached by two of his former assistants, [[Gary Moeller]] and then [[Lloyd Carr]], who maintained the program's overall success over the next 18 years. However, the program's fortunes declined under the next two coaches, [[Rich Rodriguez]] and [[Brady Hoke]], who were both fired after relatively short tenures.  Following Hoke's dismissal, Michigan hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] on December 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|title=Michigan Hires Jim Harbaugh as New Head Coach|first=Molly Geary and Scooby Axson / Sports|last=Illustrated|website=Time|access-date=December 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033514/https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|archive-date=September 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Harbaugh is a former [[quarterback]] of the team, having played for Michigan between [[1982 Michigan Wolverines football team|1982]] and [[1986 Michigan Wolverines football team|1986]] under Schembechler.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines have featured 83 players that have garnered consensus selection to the [[College Football All-America Team]]. Three Wolverines have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]: [[Tom Harmon]] in 1940, [[Desmond Howard]] in 1991, and [[Charles Woodson]] in 1997.

Michigan also missed a bowl game invitation for the first time since 1974. For the [[2009 Michigan Wolverines football team|2009 season]] the team saw many changes from the previous year.

In his first season, Hoke led the Wolverines to 11 wins, beating rival [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] with a spectacular comeback in Michigan's first night game at [[Michigan Stadium]]. Despite losing to [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] and [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]], the Wolverines finished with a 10\u20132 regular season record with their first win over Ohio State in eight years. The Wolverines received an invitation to the [[2012 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] in which they defeated [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], 23\u201320, in overtime. This was the program's first bowl win since the season of 2007. Until the streak was broken in 2008, Michigan had appeared in a bowl game each year since the 1975 season.\n\nIn Hoke's second season, he led Michigan to an 8\u20135 record.

Michigan then traveled to face eventual national runner-up [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. In this game, the Wolverines committed six turnovers, including five interceptions, as they fell to the Fighting Irish by a 13\u20136 final. After back-to-back wins over [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]], they defeated in-state rival [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] for the first time since 2007. The win was the 900th in program history, becoming the first program to reach the milestone.
