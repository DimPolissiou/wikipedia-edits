Notable players include [[Carlos Santana]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Angel Olsen]]. Only 3,089 of them were sold before the instrument was discontinued in 1980.\n\n==History==\n\nThe S-1 was introduced as part of Gibson's attempt to break into the [[single-coil]] guitar market, which was then dominated by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. It began production in mid-1974, and debuted in 1975 with endorsements from [[Carlos Santana]] as well as [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] guitarists [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Keith Richards]]. However, the nontraditional construction and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]-like characteristics led to disappointing sales, as they previously had with the similar [[Gibson Marauder]]. As a result, both the [[Gibson Marauder|Marauder]] and the S-1 were discontinued in early 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vintageguitars.org.uk/s1.php |title=The Gibson S1 |website=Vintage Guitar and Bass |access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe S-1 enjoys an afterlife as a [[vintage guitar]]. Its main exponent as of 2020 is [[Angel Olsen]], who gravitated towards the instrument for its geminiical tonal profile.<ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor |first=Luke |date=2017-05-07 |title=The Current's Guitar Collection: Angel Olsen, 1979 Gibson S-1 |url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/05/07/the-currents-guitar-collection-angel-olsen |work=The Current|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Angel_Olsen_@_The_Sinclair_(Cambridge,_MA)_(29733888992).jpg|thumb|[[Angel Olsen]] playing her 1979 Gibson S-1]]\n\n==Description==\n\nThe body of the S-1 was broadly similar to the [[Gibson Marauder|Marauder]]. It was made of a solid [[Gibson_Les_Paul_Junior|Les Paul Jr]]-like body with a maple [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]] neck bolted on. It was adorned with [[Schaller]] made \"Harmonica\" (\"tune-o-matic\" style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece.\n\nHowever, the S-1 was unique in its elaborate electronics and wiring. It featured three \"see-thru\" [[single-coil pickups]] designed by [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]], which could be used together to generate [[humbucker|humbucking]] sounds. The pickups were controlled by a combination of a toggle switch and a \"chicken head\" rotary switch.

Notable players include [[Carlos Santana]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Angel Olsen]]. Only 3,089 of them were sold before the instrument was discontinued in 1980.\n\n==History==\n\nThe S-1 was introduced as part of Gibson's attempt to break into the [[single-coil]] guitar market, which was then dominated by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. It began production in mid-1974, and debuted in 1975 with endorsements from [[Carlos Santana]] as well as [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] guitarists [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Keith Richards]]. However, the nontraditional construction and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]-like characteristics led to disappointing sales, as they previously had with the similar [[Gibson Marauder]]. As a result, both the [[Gibson Marauder|Marauder]] and the S-1 were discontinued in early 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vintageguitars.org.uk/s1.php |title=The Gibson S1 |website=Vintage Guitar and Bass |access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe S-1 enjoys an afterlife as a [[vintage guitar]].

It was made of a solid [[Les Paul Jr]]-like body with a maple [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]] neck bolted on. It was adorned with [[Schaller]] made \"Harmonica\" (\"tune-o-matic\" style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece.\n\nHowever, the S-1 was unique in its elaborate electronics and wiring. It featured three \"see-thru\" [[single-coil pickups]] designed by [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]], which could be used together to generate [[humbucker|humbucking]] sounds. The pickups were controlled by a combination of a toggle switch and a \"chicken head\" rotary switch. The rotary switch had four positions which allowed different selections of pickup combinations: 1) neck + middle, 2), middle pick-up + bridge pick-up, 3) all three together, and 4) the neck and bridge out of phase. The toggle switch bypassed the entire 4 position rotary switch circuit and made one straight connection to the bridge pick-up. \n\nBecause of its unusual pickups and unique wiring scheme, the instrument was capable of a wide range of distinctive sounds.

It was a twin [[turboprop]] configuration, and carried two crew members in side-by-side seating. The Mohawk was intended to operate from short, unimproved runways in support of [[United States Army]] maneuver forces.\n\n==Development==\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of OV-1 Mohawk-1960.ogv\n| title       = Overview of the OV-1 Mohawk (1960)\n}}\nThe Mohawk began as a joint Army-Marine program through the then-Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] (BuAer), for an observation/attack plane that would outperform the [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog|Cessna L-19 Bird Dog]]. In June 1956, the Army issued Type Specification TS145, which called for the development and procurement of a two-seat, twin turboprop aircraft designed to operate from small, unimproved fields under all weather conditions. It would be faster, with greater firepower, and heavier armour than the Bird Dog, which had proved vulnerable during the [[Korean War]]. The Mohawk's mission would include observation, [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]], air control, emergency resupply, naval target spotting, liaison, and radiological monitoring. The Navy specified that the aircraft must be capable of operating from small \"jeep\" [[Escort carrier|escort class carriers]] (CVEs). The DoD selected Grumman Aircraft Corporation's G-134 design as the winner of the competition in 1957. Marine requirements contributed an unusual feature to the design. As originally proposed, the OF-1 could be fitted with water skis that would allow the aircraft to land at sea and taxi to island beaches at 20 knots. Since the Marines were authorized to operate fixed-wing aircraft in the [[close air support]] (CAS) role, the mockup also featured underwing pylons for rockets, bombs, and other stores.\n\nThe Air Force did not like the armament capability of the Mohawk and tried to get it removed. The Marines did not want the sophisticated sensors the Army wanted, so when their Navy sponsors opted to buy a fleet oil tanker, they dropped from the program. The Army continued with armed Mohawks and developed cargo pods that could be dropped from underwing hard points to resupply troops in emergencies.\n\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of SLAR on OV-1D Mohawk.ogv\n| title       = The OV-1 Mohawk's SLAR capabilities\n}}\nThe radar imaging capability of the Mohawk was to prove a significant advance in both peace and war. The [[Side looking airborne radar|Side-Looking Airborne Radar]] (SLAR) could look through foliage and map terrain, presenting the observer with a film image of the earth below only minutes after the area was scanned. In military operations, the image was split in two parts, one showing fixed terrain features, the other spotting moving targets.\n\nThe prototype (''YAO-1AF'') first flew on April 14, 1959. The OV-1 entered production in October 1959.\n\nIn mid-1961, the first Mohawks to serve with U.S. forces overseas were delivered to the [[United States Army Europe|7th Army]] at [[Coleman Army Airfield|Sandhofen Airfield]] near Mannheim, Germany. Before its formal acceptance, the camera-carrying AO-1AF was flown by Ralph Donnell on a tour of 29 European airfields to display it to the U.S. Army field commanders and potential European customers. In addition to their Vietnam and European service, SLAR-equipped Mohawks began operational missions in 1963 patrolling the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Germany and France showed early interest in the Mohawk, and Grumman actually signed a license production agreement with the French manufacturer [[Breguet Aviation]] in exchange for American rights to the [[Breguet Atlantic|Atlantic]] maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nThe very nature of the joint Army/Marine program had forced design compromises, such as [[ejection seat]]s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/ov1seats.htm |title = The Ejection Site: OV-1 Mohawk Ejection Seats}}</ref> that made the aircraft expensive and, sometimes, an openly resisted item in Army budgets. Orders for the OV-1 stopped in Fiscal 1964, and the controversy in the Pentagon over the armed Mohawk peaked with a 1965 directive that prohibited the Army from operating armed fixed-wing aircraft (See the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]]). Operational success in Vietnam led to additional Mohawk orders in 1966, and by 1968, five surveillance companies were operating in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe last of the Mohawk versions to enter production was the OV-1D with more powerful [[Lycoming T53|T53-701]] engines, improved avionics, and interchangeable mission pallets that made it possible to switch the aircraft from infrared to SLAR configuration in about an hour. The first four OV-1Ds were prototypes converted from earlier production airframes, and the first flew in 1969. These were followed by 37 new-build aircraft, the last of which was delivered in December 1970.\n\n[[File:OV-1 Mohawk proposed variants diagrams.png|thumb|Proposed variants of the OV-1]]\nOver the years, the mission and the aircraft underwent many changes and roughly 380 were built over all variants. Mohawk variants included the JOV-1 [armed reconnaissance], OV-1A, [visual and photographic], OV-1B [visual, photographic, and side-looking radar (SLAR) pod], the OV-1C [visual, photographic, and infrared], and the OV-1D (SLAR pod and bigger wings), OV-1E [enlarged fuselage for more sensor operators or cargo], EV-1E [special [[Signals intelligence#ELINT|electronic intelligence]] installation] and RV-1E [advanced ELINT reconnaissance]. A four-engined Model 134E with [[tiltwing]]s and tail [[ducted fan]] for control for [[VTOL]] was proposed to the Army but not built. Model 134R was a tandem cockpit version offered to meet the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco#Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft|Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft]] (LARA) requirement, but the NA300 was chosen instead becoming the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco|OV-10]].\n\n==Operational history==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== United States Army ===\nThe U.S. Army flew the OV-1 operationally in the [[Vietnam War]], with sixty-five lost to accidents, ground fire, and one shot down by a North Vietnamese fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/the-ov-1-mohawk-remembered-firsthand-piloting-the-mohawk-in-vietnam/|title=The OV-1 Mohawk Remembered Firsthand: Piloting the Mohawk in Vietnam|publisher=Defense Media Network|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> The Army also used the aircraft during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]].\n\nStarting in 1972, the [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) began to receive the Mohawk, with the ARNG eventually operating thirteen OV-1Bs, twenty-four OV-1Cs, and sixteen OV-1Ds serving with three aviation units in Georgia and Oregon.  The Oregon Army National Guard Unit operating the Mohawk was located at [[McNary Field]] in Oregon, initially as the 1042nd Military Intelligence Company (Aerial Surveillance), then reflagged as the 641st Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI)(Aerial Exploitation).\n\nU.S. Army OV-1s were retired from Europe in 1992, from Korea in September 1996, and finally in the United States in 1996, superseded by newer systems, newer aircraft, and the evolution of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s. The OV-1 was primarily replaced by the EO-5C, a militarized version of the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] turboprop airliner equipped with a SLAR system, until the U.S. Air Force's [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS]] (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System) aircraft became fully operational.\n\nAs of 2011, [[Alliant Techsystems]] partnered with the Broadbay Group and Mohawk Technologies of Florida in a venture to return an armed, modernized version of the OV-1D to operational use as a [[counter-insurgency aircraft]].  A demonstrator was equipped with a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] Star Safire turret and a ventral, trainable [[M230 chain gun]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Defense Technology International Magazine |date=April 2011 |volume=5 |issue=4) |page=40 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/DTI |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=1935-6269}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://defensetech.org/2010/10/28/old-school-coin-planes-keep-coming-back/ |first=John |last=Reed |title=Old School COIN Planes Keep Coming Back |work=Defensetech |date=2010-10-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Argentine Army ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Argentine Army Aviation]] received twenty-three OV-1 in the 1990s.

Due to the [[Key West Agreement]], the Army wanted to keep the shootdown a secret in fears that it would allow the USAF to yank its Mohawks from the inventory.  The Mohawk would serve until 1996, when it was formally retired from the US Army\u2019s inventory.  Lee's kill was finally formally recognized by the Army in 2007. <ref>https://warisboring.com/the-armys-only-air-to-air-kill-since-wwii-was-done-with-a-50-cal-in-vietnam/</ref>\n\nOn November 1, 2019 at 13:15, a Grumman OV-1D Mohawk operated by Mohawk Airshows crashed at Witham Field (SUA, KSUA), Stuart, Florida, during the Stuart Air Show. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot was killed.

The Mohawk was intended to operate from short, unimproved runways in support of [[United States Army]] maneuver forces.\n\n==Development==\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of OV-1 Mohawk-1960.ogv\n| title       = Overview of the OV-1 Mohawk (1960)\n}}\nThe Mohawk began as a joint Army-Marine program through the then-Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] (BuAer), for an observation/attack plane that would outperform the [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog|Cessna L-19 Bird Dog]]. In June 1956, the Army issued Type Specification TS145, which called for the development and procurement of a two-seat, twin turboprop aircraft designed to operate from small, unimproved fields under all weather conditions. It would be faster, with greater firepower, and heavier armour than the Bird Dog, which had proved vulnerable during the [[Korean War]]. The Mohawk's mission would include observation, [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]], air control, emergency resupply, naval target spotting, liaison, and radiological monitoring. The Navy specified that the aircraft must be capable of operating from small \"jeep\" [[Escort carrier|escort class carriers]] (CVEs). The DoD selected Grumman Aircraft Corporation's G-134 design as the winner of the competition in 1957. Marine requirements contributed an unusual feature to the design. As originally proposed, the OF-1 could be fitted with water skis that would allow the aircraft to land at sea and taxi to island beaches at 20 knots. Since the Marines were authorized to operate fixed-wing aircraft in the [[close air support]] (CAS) role, the mockup also featured underwing pylons for rockets, bombs, and other stores.\n\nThe Air Force did not like the armament capability of the Mohawk and tried to get it removed. The Marines did not want the sophisticated sensors the Army wanted, so when their Navy sponsors opted to buy a fleet oil tanker, they dropped from the program. The Army continued with armed Mohawks and developed cargo pods that could be dropped from underwing hard points to resupply troops in emergencies.\n\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of SLAR on OV-1D Mohawk.ogv\n| title       = The OV-1 Mohawk's SLAR capabilities\n}}\nThe radar imaging capability of the Mohawk was to prove a significant advance in both peace and war. The [[Side looking airborne radar|Side-Looking Airborne Radar]] (SLAR) could look through foliage and map terrain, presenting the observer with a film image of the earth below only minutes after the area was scanned. In military operations, the image was split in two parts, one showing fixed terrain features, the other spotting moving targets.\n\nThe prototype (''YAO-1AF'') first flew on April 14, 1959. The OV-1 entered production in October 1959.\n\nIn mid-1961, the first Mohawks to serve with U.S. forces overseas were delivered to the [[United States Army Europe|7th Army]] at [[Coleman Army Airfield|Sandhofen Airfield]] near Mannheim, Germany. Before its formal acceptance, the camera-carrying AO-1AF was flown by Ralph Donnell on a tour of 29 European airfields to display it to the U.S. Army field commanders and potential European customers. In addition to their Vietnam and European service, SLAR-equipped Mohawks began operational missions in 1963 patrolling the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Germany and France showed early interest in the Mohawk, and Grumman actually signed a license production agreement with the French manufacturer [[Breguet Aviation]] in exchange for American rights to the [[Breguet Atlantic|Atlantic]] maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nThe very nature of the joint Army/Marine program had forced design compromises, such as [[ejection seat]]s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/ov1seats.htm |title = The Ejection Site: OV-1 Mohawk Ejection Seats}}</ref> that made the aircraft expensive and, sometimes, an openly resisted item in Army budgets. Orders for the OV-1 stopped in Fiscal 1964, and the controversy in the Pentagon over the armed Mohawk peaked with a 1965 directive that prohibited the Army from operating armed fixed-wing aircraft (See the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]]). Operational success in Vietnam led to additional Mohawk orders in 1966, and by 1968, five surveillance companies were operating in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe last of the Mohawk versions to enter production was the OV-1D with more powerful [[Lycoming T53|T53-701]] engines, improved avionics, and interchangeable mission pallets that made it possible to switch the aircraft from infrared to SLAR configuration in about an hour. The first four OV-1Ds were prototypes converted from earlier production airframes, and the first flew in 1969. These were followed by 37 new-build aircraft, the last of which was delivered in December 1970.\n\n[[File:OV-1 Mohawk proposed variants diagrams.png|thumb|Proposed variants of the OV-1]]\nOver the years, the mission and the aircraft underwent many changes and roughly 380 were built over all variants. Mohawk variants included the JOV-1 [armed reconnaissance], OV-1A, [visual and photographic], OV-1B [visual, photographic, and side-looking radar (SLAR) pod], the OV-1C [visual, photographic, and infrared], and the OV-1D (SLAR pod and bigger wings), OV-1E [enlarged fuselage for more sensor operators or cargo], EV-1E [special [[Signals intelligence#ELINT|electronic intelligence]] installation] and RV-1E [advanced ELINT reconnaissance]. A four-engined Model 134E with [[tiltwing]]s and tail [[ducted fan]] for control for [[VTOL]] was proposed to the Army but not built. Model 134R was a tandem cockpit version offered to meet the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco#Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft|Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft]] (LARA) requirement, but the NA300 was chosen instead becoming the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco|OV-10]].\n\n==Operational history==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== United States Army ===\nThe U.S. Army flew the OV-1 operationally in the [[Vietnam War]], with sixty-five lost to accidents, ground fire, and one shot down by a North Vietnamese fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/the-ov-1-mohawk-remembered-firsthand-piloting-the-mohawk-in-vietnam/|title=The OV-1 Mohawk Remembered Firsthand: Piloting the Mohawk in Vietnam|publisher=Defense Media Network|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> The Army also used the aircraft during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]].\n\nStarting in 1972, the [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) began to receive the Mohawk, with the ARNG eventually operating thirteen OV-1Bs, twenty-four OV-1Cs, and sixteen OV-1Ds serving with three aviation units in Georgia and Oregon.  The Oregon Army National Guard Unit operating the Mohawk was located at [[McNary Field]] in Oregon, initially as the 1042nd Military Intelligence Company (Aerial Surveillance), then reflagged as the 641st Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI)(Aerial Exploitation).\n\nU.S. Army OV-1s were retired from Europe in 1992, from Korea in September 1996, and finally in the United States in 1996, superseded by newer systems, newer aircraft, and the evolution of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s. The OV-1 was primarily replaced by the EO-5C, a militarized version of the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] turboprop airliner equipped with a SLAR system, until the U.S. Air Force's [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS]] (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System) aircraft became fully operational.\n\nAs of 2011, [[Alliant Techsystems]] partnered with the Broadbay Group and Mohawk Technologies of Florida in a venture to return an armed, modernized version of the OV-1D to operational use as a [[counter-insurgency aircraft]].  A demonstrator was equipped with a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] Star Safire turret and a ventral, trainable [[M230 chain gun]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Defense Technology International Magazine |date=April 2011 |volume=5 |issue=4) |page=40 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/DTI |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=1935-6269}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://defensetech.org/2010/10/28/old-school-coin-planes-keep-coming-back/ |first=John |last=Reed |title=Old School COIN Planes Keep Coming Back |work=Defensetech |date=2010-10-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Argentine Army ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Argentine Army Aviation]] received twenty-three OV-1 in the 1990s.

Due to the Key West Agreement, the Army wanted to keep the shootdown a secret in fears that it would allow the USAF to yank its Mohawks from the inventory.  Lee's kill was finally formally recognized by the Army in 2007.  The Mohawk would serve until 1996, when it was formally retired from the US Army\u2019s inventory.<ref>https://warisboring.com/the-armys-only-air-to-air-kill-since-wwii-was-done-with-a-50-cal-in-vietnam/</ref>\n\nOn November 1, 2019 at 13:15, a Grumman OV-1D Mohawk operated by Mohawk Airshows crashed at Witham Field (SUA, KSUA), Stuart, Florida, during the Stuart Air Show. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot was killed.

Her one surviving signature spells it \"Katheryn\". Biographer [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]] uses the common modern spelling \"Catherine\"; other historians use the traditional English form \"Katherine\", such as [[Antonia Fraser]].}} She was the daughter of [[Lord Edmund Howard]] and [[Joyce Culpeper]], cousin to [[Anne Boleyn]] (the second wife of Henry VIII), and niece to [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]]. Thomas Howard was a prominent politician at Henry's court, and he secured her a place in the household of Henry's fourth wife, [[Anne of Cleves]], where she caught the king's interest. She married him on 28 July 1540 at [[Oatlands Palace]] in Surrey, almost immediately after the annulment of his marriage to Anne. He was 49, and she was still a teenager.\n\nCatherine was stripped of her title as queen in November 1541. She was beheaded three months later on the grounds of treason for committing adultery with her distant cousin [[Thomas Culpeper]].\n\n==Family life==\nCatherine was one of the daughters of [[Lord Edmund Howard]] ({{circa|lk=no|1478}} \u2013 1539) and [[Joyce Culpeper]] ({{circa|lk=no|1480}} \u2013 {{circa|lk=no|1528}}). Her father's sister, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Howard]], was the mother of [[Anne Boleyn]]. Therefore, Catherine Howard was the first cousin of Anne Boleyn, and the first cousin once removed of Lady Elizabeth (later [[Queen Elizabeth I]]), Anne's daughter by Henry VIII. She also was the second cousin of [[Jane Seymour]], as her grandmother [[Elizabeth Tilney]] was the sister of Seymour's grandmother [[Anne Say]].<ref>[https://famouskin.com/famous-kin-chart.php?name=22494+catherine+howard&kin=7352+jane+seymour&via=7358+elizabeth+cheney]</ref> As a granddaughter of [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk]] (1443\u20131524), Catherine had an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] pedigree. Her father was not wealthy, being the third son among 21 children and disfavoured in the custom of [[primogeniture]], by which the eldest son inherits all his father's estate.\n\nWhen Catherine's parents married, her mother already had five children from her first husband, Ralph Leigh ({{circa|lk=no|1476}} \u2013 1509); she went on to have another six with Catherine's father, Catherine being about her mother's tenth child. With little to sustain the family, her father was often reduced to begging for handouts from his more affluent relatives. After Catherine's mother died in 1528, her father married twice more. In 1531 he was appointed Controller of [[Pale of Calais|Calais]].{{sfn|Mannock|1982}} He was dismissed from his post in 1539, and died in March 1539. Catherine was the third of Henry VIII's wives to have been a member of the English [[nobility]] or [[gentry]]; [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Anne of Cleves]] were royalty from continental Europe.\n\n==Early life==\nCatherine was probably born in [[Lambeth]] in about 1523, but the exact date of her birth is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Byrne |first1=Conor |title=Katherine Howard's Birthday |url=http://onthetudortrail.com/Blog/2014/08/01/katherine-howards-birthday-a-guest-post-by-conor-byrne/ |website=On the Tudor Trail |accessdate=19 March 2016 |date=1 August 2014 }}</ref>{{sfn|Russell|2017|p=19}}  Soon after the death of her mother (in about 1528), Catherine was sent with some of her siblings to live in the care of her father's stepmother, the [[Agnes Tilney, Duchess of Norfolk|Dowager Duchess of Norfolk]]. The Dowager Duchess presided over large households at [[Chesworth House]] in [[Horsham]] in [[Sussex]], and at Norfolk House in [[Lambeth]] where dozens of attendants, along with her many wards\u2014usually the children of aristocratic but poor relatives\u2014resided.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Roberts |editor1-first=Howard |editor2-last=Godfrey |editor2-first=Walter H. |title=Norfolk House and Old Paradise Street |series=Survey of London |date=1951 |volume=23 |pages=137\u2013140 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol23/pp137-140 |accessdate=19 March 2016 |publisher=British History Online }}</ref> While sending young children to be educated and trained in aristocratic households other than their own was common for centuries among European nobles, supervision at both Chesworth House and Lambeth was apparently lax. The Dowager Duchess was often at Court and seems to have had little direct involvement in the upbringing of her wards and young female attendants.<ref>{{cite web |title=Catherine Howard |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/TUDhowardC.htm |website=Spartacus Educational |accessdate=19 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Dowager Duchess's lack of discipline, Catherine became influenced by some older girls who allowed men into the sleeping areas at night for entertainment. The girls were rewarded with food, wine, and gifts. Catherine was not as well educated as some of Henry's other wives, although, on its own, her ability to read and write was impressive enough at the time. Her character has often been described as vivacious, giggly and brisk, but never scholarly or devout. She displayed great interest in her dance lessons, but would often be distracted during them and make jokes. She also had a nurturing side for animals, particularly dogs.<ref>Weir, Henry VIII, p.424</ref>\n\nIn the Duchess's household at Horsham, in around 1536, Catherine (then around 13) was repeatedly molested by her music teacher, Henry Mannox (aged 36).  He later gave evidence in the inquiry against her. Mannox and Catherine both confessed during her adultery inquisitions that they had engaged in sexual contact, but not actual [[coitus]]. When questioned Catherine was quoted as saying, \"At the flattering and fair persuasions of Mannox, being but a young girl, I suffered him at sundry times to handle and touch the secret parts of my body, which neither became me with honesty to permit nor him to require.\"<ref name=\"ABF1\">{{cite web |last1=Ridgway |first1=Claire |title=The Marriage of Henry VIII and Catherine Howard |url=http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/the-marriage-of-henry-viii-and-catherine-howard/ |accessdate=19 March 2016 |date=28 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Gareth|title=Young and Damned and Fair: The Life of Catherine Howard, Fifth Wife of King Henry VIII|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2017|isbn=978-0008128272|location=New York|pages=279}}</ref>\n\nThe interferences by Mannox came to an end in 1538, when Catherine moved to the Dowager Duchess's household in Lambeth. There she was pursued by [[Francis Dereham]], a secretary of the Dowager Duchess. They allegedly became lovers, addressing each other as \"husband\" and \"wife\". Dereham also entrusted Catherine with various wifely duties, such as keeping his money when he was away on business. Many of Catherine's roommates among the Dowager Duchess's maids of honour and attendants knew of the relationship, which apparently ended in 1539, when the Dowager Duchess found out. Despite this, Catherine and Dereham may have parted with intentions to marry upon his return from [[Ireland]], agreeing to a precontract of marriage. If indeed they exchanged vows before having sexual intercourse, they would have been considered married in the eyes of the Church.<ref name=\"ABF1\" />\n\n==Arrival at court==\nCatherine's uncle, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], found her a place at Court in the household of the King's fourth wife, [[Anne of Cleves]].{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=413}} As a young and attractive [[lady-in-waiting]], Catherine quickly caught Henry's eye. The King had displayed little interest in Anne from the beginning, but on [[Thomas Cromwell]]'s failure to find a new match for Henry, Norfolk saw an opportunity. The Howards may have sought to recreate the influence gained during [[Anne Boleyn]]'s reign as [[queen consort]]. According to [[Nicholas Sander]], the religiously conservative [[Howard family]] may have seen Catherine as a figurehead for their fight by expressed determination to restore [[Roman Catholicism]] to England. Catholic [[Stephen Gardiner|Bishop Stephen Gardiner]] entertained the couple at [[Winchester Palace]] with \"feastings\".\n\nAs the King's interest in Catherine grew, so did the house of Norfolk's influence. Her youth, prettiness and vivacity were captivating for the middle-aged sovereign, who claimed he had never known \"the like to any woman\". Within months of her arrival at court, Henry bestowed gifts of land and expensive cloth upon Catherine. Henry called her his 'very jewel of womanhood' (that he called her his 'rose without a thorn' is likely a myth).<ref>Letters and Papers; Correspandance Politique; Weir, Henry VIII, p.432-3</ref> The French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], thought her \"delightful\". Holbein's portrait showed a young auburn-haired girl with a characteristically hooked Howard nose; Catherine was said to have a \"gentle, earnest face.\"\n\n==Marriage==\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Catherine Howard.svg|thumb|Catherine Howard's arms as queen{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\nKing Henry and Catherine were married by [[Bishop Bonner]] of London at [[Oatlands Palace]] on 28 July 1540, the same day Cromwell was executed. She was a teenager and he was 49. Catherine adopted the motto, ''Non autre volont\u00e9 que la sienne'' or \"No other wish but his\" using the English translation from French. The marriage was made public on 8 August, and prayers were said in the Chapel Royal at [[Hampton Court Palace]].<ref>''Letters and Papers''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.437</ref> Henry \"indulged her every whim\" thanks to her \"caprice\".<ref>''Correspandance''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.437</ref>\n\nCatherine was young, joyous and carefree; Mannox had taught her to play the [[virginals]]. She was too young to take part in administrative matters of State. Nevertheless, every night [[Sir Thomas Heneage]], [[Groom of the Stool]], came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the [[City of London]] to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by jointure at [[Baynard's Castle|Baynard Castle]]: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards. Every day she dressed with new clothes in the French fashion bedecked with precious jewels. With ominous foresight the motto adopted read ''Non autre volont\u00e9 que la sienne'' (No other will but his/hers), decorated in gold around her sleeves.<ref>''Letters and Papers''; ''Correspondance''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.440\u20131</ref>\n\nThe Queen escaped plague-ridden London in August 1540 when on [[Royal Entry|progress]]. The royal couple's entourage travelled on honeymoon through [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Buckingham]]. After the Queen's Chamberlain got drunk and misbehaved, the King was in a bad mood when they moved on to [[Woking Palace|Woking]], when his health improved. The King embarked on a lavish spending spree to celebrate his marriage, with extensive refurbishments and developments at the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. This was followed by more expensive gifts for Christmas at Hampton Court Palace.<ref>BL Royal MSS, State Papers; BL Add MSS; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.446-7</ref>\n\nThat winter the King's bad moods deepened and grew more furious. Undoubtedly the pain from his ulcerous legs was agony, but did not make relations any easier at court. He accused councillors of being \"lying time-servers\", and began to regret losing Cromwell. After a dark depressed March, his mood lifted at Easter.\n\nPreparations were in place for any signs of a royal pregnancy, reported by Marillac on 15 April as \"if it be found true, to have her crowned at [[Whitsun]]tide.\"<ref>''Letters and Papers''; ''Correspondance''; ''Spanish Papers''; Weir, Henry VIII, p.449</ref>\n\n==Downfall==\nCatherine may have been involved during her marriage to the King with Henry's favourite male courtier, [[Thomas Culpeper]], a young man who \"had succeeded [him] in the Queen's affections\", according to Dereham's later testimony. She had considered marrying Culpeper during her time as a maid-of-honour to [[Anne of Cleves]]. Culpeper called Catherine \"my little, sweet fool\" in a love letter.<ref>''Letters and Papers''; Hall, ''Triumphant''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.454</ref> It has been alleged that in the spring of 1541 the pair were meeting secretly. Their meetings were allegedly arranged by one of Catherine's older ladies-in-waiting, [[Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford]] (Lady Rochford), the widow of Catherine's executed cousin, [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]], [[Anne Boleyn]]'s brother.<ref>Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.449</ref>\n\nDuring the autumn [[Royal Entry|Northern Progress]], a crisis over Catherine's conduct began to loom. People who claimed to have witnessed her earlier sexual behaviour while she was still a ward at [[Lambeth]] reportedly contacted her for favours in return for their silence, and some of these blackmailers may have been appointed to her royal household. [[John Lascelles]], the brother of [[Mary Lassells|Mary Lascelles]], claimed that he had tried to persuade his sister to find a place within the Queen's royal chamber.  However Mary had allegedly refused, stating that she had witnessed the \"light\" ways of Queen Catherine while they were living together at Lambeth. Supposedly after hearing this John Lascelles reported such news to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], who then interrogated Lascelles's sister. Under the archbishop's interrogation, Mary alleged that Catherine had had sexual relations while under the Duchess's care, before her relationship with the King.\n\nCranmer immediately took up the case to be made to topple his rivals\u2014the Roman Catholic Norfolk family. Lady Rochford was interrogated and from fear of being tortured agreed to talk. She told how she had watched for Catherine backstairs as Culpeper had made his escapes from the Queen's room.{{sfn|Smith|1961|p=173}}\n\n[[File:CatherineHowardLetter.jpg|thumb|Letter from Catherine Howard to Thomas Culpeper]]\nDuring the investigation a love letter written in the Queen's distinctive handwriting was found in Culpeper's chambers. This is the only letter of hers that survived (other than her later \"confession\").<ref name=\"Letter\">{{cite web |title=Letter of Queen Catherine Howard to Master Thomas Culpeper, Spring 1541 |work=Catherine Howard |url=http://englishhistory.net/tudor/letter13.html |publisher=Englishhistory.net |accessdate=31 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010022828/http://englishhistory.net/tudor/letter13.html |archive-date=10 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Smith|1961|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nIt is unlikely that King Henry was unaware of the allegations against his wife when on [[All Saints' Day]], 1 November 1541, he arranged to be found praying in the Chapel Royal,<ref>''Letters and Papers''; ''Acts of the Privy Council''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.453</ref> where he received a warrant of the queen's arrest that described her crimes. On 7 November 1541 Archbishop Cranmer led a delegation of councillors to [[Winchester Palace]], Southwark, to question her. Even the staunch Cranmer found the teenage Catherine's frantic, incoherent state pitiable, saying, \"I found her in such lamentation and heaviness as I never saw no creature, so that it would have pitied any man's heart to have looked upon her.\"{{sfn|Herman|2006|pp=81\u201382}} He ordered the guards to remove any objects that she might use to commit suicide.\n\n==Imprisonment and death==\nEstablishing the existence of a precontract between Catherine and Dereham would have had the effect of terminating Catherine's royal union, but it would also have allowed Henry to annul their marriage and banish her from Court in poverty and disgrace instead of executing her, though there is no indication that Henry would have chosen that alternative. Yet Catherine steadfastly denied any precontract, maintaining that Dereham had raped her.\n\nCatherine was stripped of her title as queen on 23 November 1541 and imprisoned in the new [[Syon Abbey]], [[Middlesex]], formerly a convent, where she remained throughout the winter of 1541.<ref>Weir, Henry VIII, p.453</ref> She was forced by a Privy Councillor to return Anne of Cleves's ring that the King had given her; it was a symbol of her regal and lawful rights. The King would be at Hampton Court, but she would not see him again. Despite these actions taken against her, her marriage to Henry was never formally annulled.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1yHXitDdyQC&pg=PA483&lpg=PA483&dq=Catherine+Howard+%22never+formally+annulled%22 Weir 1991], p. 483</ref>\n\nCulpeper and Dereham were arraigned at Guildhall on 1 December 1541 for [[high treason]]. They were executed at [[Tyburn]] on 10 December 1541, Culpeper being beheaded and Dereham being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. According to custom, their heads were placed on spikes atop [[London Bridge]]. Many of Catherine's relatives were also detained in the Tower with the exception of her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, who had sufficiently distanced himself from the scandal by retreating to [[Kenninghall]] to write a grovelling letter of apology.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=474}}\n\nThe Duke of Norfolk's son [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], a poet, remained a favourite of the King.

Entering through the [[Traitors' Gate]] she was led to her prison cell.

According to popular folklore her [[last words]] were, \"I die a Queen, but I would rather have died the wife of Culpeper\". However no eyewitness accounts support this, instead reporting that she stuck to traditional final words, asking for forgiveness for her sins and acknowledging that she deserved to die 'a thousand deaths' for betraying the king, who had always treated her so graciously. This was typical of the speeches given by those executed during that period, most likely in an effort to protect their families, since the condemned's last words would be relayed to the King.

Each is more or less sympathetic, though they disagree on various important points involving Catherine's motivations, date of birth and overall character.\n\nHer life has also been described in the five collective studies of Henry's queens that have appeared since the publication of [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]]'s ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (book)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1991) \u2014 such as [[David Starkey]]'s ''The Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII'' (2003). Several of these writers have been highly critical of Catherine's conduct, if sympathetic to her eventual fate. Baldwin Smith described Catherine's life as one of [[hedonism]] and characterised her as a \"[[juvenile delinquent]]\", as did Francis Hackett in his 1929 biography of Henry. Weir had much the same judgement, describing her as an \"empty-headed wanton\". The general trend, however, has been more generous, particularly in the works of [[Antonia Fraser]], Karen Lindsey, [[David Loades]], Joanna Denny, Josephine Wilkinson, and Gareth Russell.\n\n==Portraits==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait of a Lady, perhaps Katherine Howard (Royal Collection).JPG|[[#Miniatures|''Portrait of a Lady, perhaps Katherine Howard''<br>(Royal Collection)]]{{sfn|Strong|1983|p=50}}\nFile:Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait Miniature of Katherine Howard (Strawberry Hill).jpg|[[#Miniatures|''Portrait Miniature of Katherine Howard''<br>(Buccleuch Collection)]]{{sfn|Strong|1983|p=50}}\nFile:Hans Holbein the Younger - Unknown woman formerly known as Catherine Howard RL 12218.jpg|[[#Miniatures|''Unknown woman formerly known as Catherine Howard''<br>(Royal Collection)]]{{sfn|Parker|1945|p=53, pl. 62}}\nFile:Holbein, Hans (II) - Portrait of a lady, probably of the Cromwell Family formerly known as Catherine Howard - WGA11565.jpg|[[#Panel portraits|''Portrait of a Lady, probably a Member of the Cromwell Family''<br>(Toledo Museum of Art)]]{{sfn|Strong|1967|pp=278\u2013281|ps=: \"The portrait should by rights depict a lady of the Cromwell family aged 21 c.1535\u201340...\"}}{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2019}}\n</gallery>\n\nPainters continued to include [[Jane Seymour]] in pictures of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] long after she died, mainly because Henry continued to look back on her with favour as the only wife who gave him a son.

Her one surviving signature spells it \"Katheryn\". Biographer [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]] uses the common modern spelling \"Catherine\"; other historians use the traditional English form \"Katherine\", such as [[Antonia Fraser]].}} She was the daughter of [[Lord Edmund Howard]] and [[Joyce Culpeper]], cousin to [[Anne Boleyn]] (the second wife of Henry VIII), and niece to [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]]. Thomas Howard was a prominent politician at Henry's court, and he secured her a place in the household of Henry's fourth wife, [[Anne of Cleves]], where she caught the king's interest. She married him on 28 July 1540 at [[Oatlands Palace]] in Surrey, almost immediately after the annulment of his marriage to Anne. He was 49, and she was still a teenager.\n\nCatherine was stripped of her title as queen in November 1541. She was beheaded three months later on the grounds of treason for committing adultery with her distant cousin [[Thomas Culpeper]].\n\n==Family life==\nCatherine was one of the daughters of [[Lord Edmund Howard]] ({{circa|lk=no|1478}} \u2013 1539) and [[Joyce Culpeper]] ({{circa|lk=no|1480}} \u2013 {{circa|lk=no|1528}}). Her father's sister, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Howard]], was the mother of [[Anne Boleyn]]. Therefore, Catherine Howard was the first cousin of Anne Boleyn, and the first cousin once removed of Lady Elizabeth (later [[Queen Elizabeth I]]), Anne's daughter by Henry VIII. She also was the second cousin of [[Jane Seymour]], as her grandmother [[Elizabeth Tilney]] was the sister of Seymour's grandmother [[Anne Say]].<ref>[https://famouskin.com/famous-kin-chart.php?name=22494+catherine+howard&kin=7352+jane+seymour&via=7358+elizabeth+cheney]</ref> As a granddaughter of [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk]] (1443\u20131524), Catherine had an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] pedigree. Her father was not wealthy, being the third son among 21 children and disfavoured in the custom of [[primogeniture]], by which the eldest son inherits all his father's estate.\n\nWhen Catherine's parents married, her mother already had five children from her first husband, Ralph Leigh ({{circa|lk=no|1476}} \u2013 1509); she went on to have another six with Catherine's father, Catherine being about her mother's tenth child. With little to sustain the family, her father was often reduced to begging for handouts from his more affluent relatives. After Catherine's mother died in 1528, her father married twice more. In 1531 he was appointed Controller of [[Pale of Calais|Calais]].{{sfn|Mannock|1982}} He was dismissed from his post in 1539, and died in March 1539. Catherine was the third of Henry VIII's wives to have been a member of the English [[nobility]] or [[gentry]]; [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Anne of Cleves]] were royalty from continental Europe.\n\n==Early life==\nCatherine was probably born in [[Lambeth]] in about 1523, but the exact date of her birth is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Byrne |first1=Conor |title=Katherine Howard's Birthday |url=http://onthetudortrail.com/Blog/2014/08/01/katherine-howards-birthday-a-guest-post-by-conor-byrne/ |website=On the Tudor Trail |accessdate=19 March 2016 |date=1 August 2014 }}</ref>{{sfn|Russell|2017|p=19}}  Soon after the death of her mother (in about 1528), Catherine was sent with some of her siblings to live in the care of her father's stepmother, the [[Agnes Tilney, Duchess of Norfolk|Dowager Duchess of Norfolk]]. The Dowager Duchess presided over large households at [[Chesworth House]] in [[Horsham]] in [[Sussex]], and at Norfolk House in [[Lambeth]] where dozens of attendants, along with her many wards\u2014usually the children of aristocratic but poor relatives\u2014resided.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Roberts |editor1-first=Howard |editor2-last=Godfrey |editor2-first=Walter H. |title=Norfolk House and Old Paradise Street |series=Survey of London |date=1951 |volume=23 |pages=137\u2013140 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol23/pp137-140 |accessdate=19 March 2016 |publisher=British History Online }}</ref> While sending young children to be educated and trained in aristocratic households other than their own was common for centuries among European nobles, supervision at both Chesworth House and Lambeth was apparently lax. The Dowager Duchess was often at Court and seems to have had little direct involvement in the upbringing of her wards and young female attendants.<ref>{{cite web |title=Catherine Howard |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/TUDhowardC.htm |website=Spartacus Educational |accessdate=19 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Dowager Duchess's lack of discipline, Catherine became influenced by some older girls who allowed men into the sleeping areas at night for entertainment. The girls were rewarded with food, wine, and gifts. Catherine was not as well educated as some of Henry's other wives, although, on its own, her ability to read and write was impressive enough at the time. Her character has often been described as vivacious, giggly and brisk, but never scholarly or devout. She displayed great interest in her dance lessons, but would often be distracted during them and make jokes. She also had a nurturing side for animals, particularly dogs.<ref>Weir, Henry VIII, p.424</ref>\n\nIn the Duchess's household at Horsham, in around 1536, Catherine (then around 13) was repeatedly molested by her music teacher, Henry Mannox (aged 36).  He later gave evidence in the inquiry against her. Mannox and Catherine both confessed during her adultery inquisitions that they had engaged in sexual contact, but not actual [[coitus]]. When questioned Catherine was quoted as saying, \"At the flattering and fair persuasions of Mannox, being but a young girl, I suffered him at sundry times to handle and touch the secret parts of my body, which neither became me with honesty to permit nor him to require.\"<ref name=\"ABF1\">{{cite web |last1=Ridgway |first1=Claire |title=The Marriage of Henry VIII and Catherine Howard |url=http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/the-marriage-of-henry-viii-and-catherine-howard/ |accessdate=19 March 2016 |date=28 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Gareth|title=Young and Damned and Fair: The Life of Catherine Howard, Fifth Wife of King Henry VIII|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2017|isbn=978-0008128272|location=New York|pages=279}}</ref>\n\nThe interferences by Mannox came to an end in 1538, when Catherine moved to the Dowager Duchess's household in Lambeth. There she was pursued by [[Francis Dereham]], a secretary of the Dowager Duchess. They allegedly became lovers, addressing each other as \"husband\" and \"wife\". Dereham also entrusted Catherine with various wifely duties, such as keeping his money when he was away on business. Many of Catherine's roommates among the Dowager Duchess's maids of honour and attendants knew of the relationship, which apparently ended in 1539, when the Dowager Duchess found out. Despite this, Catherine and Dereham may have parted with intentions to marry upon his return from [[Ireland]], agreeing to a precontract of marriage. If indeed they exchanged vows before having sexual intercourse, they would have been considered married in the eyes of the Church.<ref name=\"ABF1\" />\n\n==Arrival at court==\nCatherine's uncle, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], found her a place at Court in the household of the King's fourth wife, [[Anne of Cleves]].{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=413}} As a young and attractive [[lady-in-waiting]], Catherine quickly caught Henry's eye. The King had displayed little interest in Anne from the beginning, but on [[Thomas Cromwell]]'s failure to find a new match for Henry, Norfolk saw an opportunity. The Howards may have sought to recreate the influence gained during [[Anne Boleyn]]'s reign as [[queen consort]]. According to [[Nicholas Sander]], the religiously conservative [[Howard family]] may have seen Catherine as a figurehead for their fight by expressed determination to restore [[Roman Catholicism]] to England. Catholic [[Stephen Gardiner|Bishop Stephen Gardiner]] entertained the couple at [[Winchester Palace]] with \"feastings\".\n\nAs the King's interest in Catherine grew, so did the house of Norfolk's influence. Her youth, prettiness and vivacity were captivating for the middle-aged sovereign, who claimed he had never known \"the like to any woman\". Within months of her arrival at court, Henry bestowed gifts of land and expensive cloth upon Catherine. Henry called her his 'very jewel of womanhood' (that he called her his 'rose without a thorn' is likely a myth).<ref>Letters and Papers; Correspandance Politique; Weir, Henry VIII, p.432-3</ref> The French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], thought her \"delightful\". Holbein's portrait showed a young auburn-haired girl with a characteristically hooked Howard nose; Catherine was said to have a \"gentle, earnest face.\"\n\n==Marriage==\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Catherine Howard.svg|thumb|Catherine Howard's arms as queen{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\nKing Henry and Catherine were married by [[Bishop Bonner]] of London at [[Oatlands Palace]] on 28 July 1540, the same day Cromwell was executed. She was a teenager and he was 49. Catherine adopted the motto, ''Non autre volont\u00e9 que la sienne'' or \"No other wish but his\" using the English translation from French. The marriage was made public on 8 August, and prayers were said in the Chapel Royal at [[Hampton Court Palace]].<ref>''Letters and Papers''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.437</ref> Henry \"indulged her every whim\" thanks to her \"caprice\".<ref>''Correspandance''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.437</ref>\n\nCatherine was young, joyous and carefree; Mannox had taught her to play the [[virginals]]. She was too young to take part in administrative matters of State. Nevertheless, every night [[Sir Thomas Heneage]], [[Groom of the Stool]], came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the [[City of London]] to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by jointure at [[Baynard's Castle|Baynard Castle]]: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards. Every day she dressed with new clothes in the French fashion bedecked with precious jewels. With ominous foresight the motto adopted read ''Non autre volont\u00e9 que la sienne'' (No other will but his/hers), decorated in gold around her sleeves.<ref>''Letters and Papers''; ''Correspondance''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.440\u20131</ref>\n\nThe Queen escaped plague-ridden London in August 1540 when on [[Royal Entry|progress]]. The royal couple's entourage travelled on honeymoon through [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Buckingham]]. After the Queen's Chamberlain got drunk and misbehaved, the King was in a bad mood when they moved on to [[Woking Palace|Woking]], when his health improved. The King embarked on a lavish spending spree to celebrate his marriage, with extensive refurbishments and developments at the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. This was followed by more expensive gifts for Christmas at Hampton Court Palace.<ref>BL Royal MSS, State Papers; BL Add MSS; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.446-7</ref>\n\nThat winter the King's bad moods deepened and grew more furious. Undoubtedly the pain from his ulcerous legs was agony, but did not make relations any easier at court. He accused councillors of being \"lying time-servers\", and began to regret losing Cromwell. After a dark depressed March, his mood lifted at Easter.\n\nPreparations were in place for any signs of a royal pregnancy, reported by Marillac on 15 April as \"if it be found true, to have her crowned at [[Whitsun]]tide.\"<ref>''Letters and Papers''; ''Correspondance''; ''Spanish Papers''; Weir, Henry VIII, p.449</ref>\n\n==Downfall==\nCatherine may have been involved during her marriage to the King with Henry's favourite male courtier, [[Thomas Culpeper]], a young man who \"had succeeded [him] in the Queen's affections\", according to Dereham's later testimony. She had considered marrying Culpeper during her time as a maid-of-honour to [[Anne of Cleves]]. Culpeper called Catherine \"my little, sweet fool\" in a love letter.<ref>''Letters and Papers''; Hall, ''Triumphant''; Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.454</ref> It has been alleged that in the spring of 1541 the pair were meeting secretly. Their meetings were allegedly arranged by one of Catherine's older ladies-in-waiting, [[Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford]] (Lady Rochford), the widow of Catherine's executed cousin, [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]], [[Anne Boleyn]]'s brother.<ref>Weir, ''Henry VIII'', p.449</ref>\n\nDuring the autumn [[Royal Entry|Northern Progress]], a crisis over Catherine's conduct began to loom. People who claimed to have witnessed her earlier sexual behaviour while she was still a ward at [[Lambeth]] reportedly contacted her for favours in return for their silence, and some of these blackmailers may have been appointed to her royal household. [[John Lascelles]], the brother of [[Mary Lassells|Mary Lascelles]], claimed that he had tried to persuade his sister to find a place within the Queen's royal chamber.  However Mary had allegedly refused, stating that she had witnessed the \"light\" ways of Queen Catherine while they were living together at Lambeth. Supposedly after hearing this John Lascelles reported such news to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], who then interrogated Lascelles's sister. Under the archbishop's interrogation, Mary alleged that Catherine had had sexual relations while under the Duchess's care, before her relationship with the King.\n\nCranmer immediately took up the case to be made to topple his rivals\u2014the Roman Catholic Norfolk family. Lady Rochford was interrogated and from fear of being tortured agreed to talk. She told how she had watched for Catherine backstairs as Culpeper had made his escapes from the Queen's room.{{sfn|Smith|1961|p=173}}\n\n[[File:CatherineHowardLetter.jpg|thumb|Letter from Catherine Howard to Thomas Culpeper]]\nDuring the investigation a love letter written in the Queen's distinctive handwriting was found in Culpeper's chambers.

On 7 November 1541 Archbishop Cranmer led a delegation of councillors to [[Winchester Palace]], Southwark, to question her.

Yet Catherine steadfastly denied any precontract, maintaining that Dereham had raped her.\n\nCatherine was stripped of her title as queen on 23 November 1541 and imprisoned in the new [[Syon Abbey]], [[Middlesex]], formerly a convent, where she remained throughout the winter of 1541.<ref>Weir, Henry VIII, p.453</ref> She was forced by a Privy Councillor to return Anne of Cleves's ring that the King had given her; it was a symbol of her regal and lawful rights.

However no eyewitness accounts support this, instead reporting that she stuck to traditional final words, asking for forgiveness for her sins and acknowledging that she deserved to die 'a thousand deaths' for betraying the king, who had always treated her so graciously. This was typical of the speeches given by those executed during that period, most likely in an effort to protect their families, since the condemned's last words would be relayed to the King.

Each is more or less sympathetic, though they disagree on various important points involving Catherine's motivations, date of birth and overall character.\n\nHer life has also been described in the five collective studies of Henry's queens that have appeared since the publication of [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]]'s ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (book)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1991) \u2014 such as [[David Starkey]]'s ''The Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII'' (2003). Several of these writers have been highly critical of Catherine's conduct, if sympathetic to her eventual fate. Baldwin Smith described Catherine's life as one of [[hedonism]] and characterised her as a \"[[juvenile delinquent]]\", as did Francis Hackett in his 1929 biography of Henry. Weir had much the same judgement, describing her as an \"empty-headed wanton\". The general trend, however, has been more generous, particularly in the works of [[Antonia Fraser]], Karen Lindsey, [[David Loades]], Joanna Denny, Josephine Wilkinson, and Gareth Russell.\n\n==Portraits==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait of a Lady, perhaps Katherine Howard (Royal Collection).JPG|[[#Miniatures|''Portrait of a Lady, perhaps Katherine Howard''<br>(Royal Collection)]]{{sfn|Strong|1983|p=50}}\nFile:Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait Miniature of Katherine Howard (Strawberry Hill).jpg|[[#Miniatures|''Portrait Miniature of Katherine Howard''<br>(Buccleuch Collection)]]{{sfn|Strong|1983|p=50}}\nFile:Hans Holbein the Younger - Unknown woman formerly known as Catherine Howard RL 12218.jpg|[[#Miniatures|''Unknown woman formerly known as Catherine Howard''<br>(Royal Collection)]]{{sfn|Parker|1945|p=53, pl. 62}}\nFile:Holbein, Hans (II) - Portrait of a lady, probably of the Cromwell Family formerly known as Catherine Howard - WGA11565.jpg|[[#Panel portraits|''Portrait of a Lady, probably a Member of the Cromwell Family''<br>(Toledo Museum of Art)]]{{sfn|Strong|1967|pp=278\u2013281|ps=: \"The portrait should by rights depict a lady of the Cromwell family aged 21 c.1535\u201340...\"}}{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2019}}\n</gallery>\n\nPainters continued to include [[Jane Seymour]] in pictures of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] long after she died, mainly because Henry continued to look back on her with favour as the only wife who gave him a son.

Created by [[Oren Peli]], the [[Paranormal Activity|original film]] was widely released in 2007.\n\nThe films are based around a family [[haunted house|haunted]] by a demon that stalks, terrifies and ultimately murders several members of the family and other bystanders during the course of the films. The series makes use of production cameras set up and used like [[security cameras]] or other recording devices in an attempt to present the films as [[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]].  The series has received overall mixed reviews across all films.  The first and third films received generally positive critical reception, the second and fifth film received more lukewarm receptions, and the fourth and sixth received mostly negative receptions. The series is a strong financial success, making strong profits based on [[return on investment]]. The series as a whole has earned over thirty times the overall budget.\n\nOn June 19, 2019, Paramount announced that a seventh installment is in development and is releasing on March 19, 2021 (Untitled Film).\n\n== Films ==\n\n=== ''Paranormal Activity'' (2007) ===\n{{Main|Paranormal Activity}}\nSet in October 2006, a young couple,katie and Micah, who have recently moved to a new house in [[San Diego]], [[California]], are terrorized by a demon that Katie believes has been following her all her life.

Peli took a year to prepare his own house for shooting, going so far as to repaint the walls, add furniture, put in a carpet, and build a stairwell. In this time, he also did extensive research into paranormal phenomena and [[demonology]], stating, \"We wanted to be as truthful as we could be.\" The decision to make the supernatural entity in the story a demon was a result of the research pointing to the most malevolent and violent entities being \"demons\". The phenomena in the film take place largely at night\u2014the vulnerability of being asleep, Peli reasoned, taps into a human being's most primal fear, stating, \"If something is lurking in your home there's not much you can do about it.\"\nAttempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a \"higher degree of plausibility\" was created for the audience and they were \"more invested in the story and the characters\". Peli says that the dialogue was \"natural\" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as \"retroscripting\" used in the making of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''. In casting the movie, Peli auditioned \"a few hundred people\" before finally meeting [[Katie Featherston]] and [[Micah Sloat]]. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, \"If you saw the footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years.\" During a guest appearance on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work.\nThe film was shot out of sequence due to Peli's self-imposed seven-day shooting schedule, though Peli would have preferred the story unfold for the actors as he had envisioned it. Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. \"It was a very intense week\", Peli recalled, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] hired screenwriter Michael R. Perry to create ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]''. Oren Peli, the director of the first film, served as a producer for this prequel. [[Kevin Greutert]], director of ''[[Saw VI]]'', was initially hired to direct the prequel; however, Lions Gate Entertainment exercised a clause in Greutert's contract to have him direct the [[Saw 3D|final film]] in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. Both of the actors from the first film, Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, reprise their roles in the [[prequel]]. [[Tod Williams (filmmaker)|Tod \"Kip\" Williams]] directed ''Paranormal Activity 2'', which started production in May 2010 and was released in October the same year.\n\n''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity 4|4]]'' were directed by [[Henry Joost]] and [[Ariel Schulman]], documentary filmmakers who were well-known for their feature debut ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]''. Production on the third entry began in June, 2011, with a release October 21 of the same year. Filming for the fourth film commenced in June, 2012, with a release of October 19.\n\nA [[Latin America]]n-themed fifth film, ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones]]'' was released on January 3, 2014. [[Oren Peli]], the creator of the franchise, returned to produce the film, while [[Christopher B.

Created by [[Oren Peli]], the [[Paranormal Activity|original film]] was widely released in 2007.\n\nThe films are based around a family [[haunted house|haunted]] by a demon that stalks, terrifies and ultimately murders several members of the family and other bystanders during the course of the films. The series makes use of production cameras set up and used like [[security cameras]] or other recording devices in an attempt to present the films as [[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]].  The series has received overall mixed reviews across all films.  The first and third films received generally positive critical reception, the second and fifth film received more lukewarm receptions, and the fourth and sixth received mostly negative receptions. The series is a strong financial success, making strong profits based on [[return on investment]]. The series as a whole has earned over thirty times the overall budget.\n\nOn June 19, 2019, Paramount announced that a seventh installment is in development and is releasing on March 19, 2021 (Untitled Film).\n\n== Films ==\n\n=== ''Paranormal Activity'' (2007) ===\n{{Main|Paranormal Activity}}\nSet in October 2006, a young couple, Katie and Micah, who have recently moved to a new house in [[San Diego]], [[California]], are terrorized by a demon that Katie believes has been following her all her life. The film is designed to look like a [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]]-styled film with Micah filming the activity in their house.\n\n=== ''Paranormal Activity 2'' (2010) ===\n{{Main|Paranormal Activity 2}}\nSet in August 2006, two months before the events of the first film, Katie's sister, Kristi, and her family, who reside in [[Carlsbad, California]], experience strange activity after Kristi's baby son, Hunter, is born. The film uses security cameras and, in some scenes, a hand-held camera to film the activity in the house.\n\n=== ''Paranormal Activity 3'' (2011) ===\n{{Main|Paranormal Activity 3}}\nSet in September 1988, it focuses on a younger Katie and Kristi, who live with their mother, Julie, and Julie's boyfriend, Dennis, in [[Santa Rosa, California]], as they encounter \"Tobi\" the demon for the first time. Concerned, Dennis decides to set up a few cameras around the house, one of which is attached to a small oscillating fan that moves the camera back and forth. The film also uses a hand-held camera.\n\n===''Paranormal Activity 4'' (2012) ===\n{{Main|Paranormal Activity 4}}\nSet in November 2011, the film focuses on Alex Nelson and her family residing in a neighborhood in [[Henderson, Nevada]]. The family began to experience hauntings, concerning Alex's adopted brother, Wyatt, after Katie and her mysterious son, Robbie, move in across the street. Alex is helped by her boyfriend, Ben, to film the activity via [[MacBook]] webcams, a [[video camera]], an [[iPhone]] camera and [[Kinect]] technology. \"Tobi\" is mentioned once in the film.\n\n=== ''Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones'' (2014) ===\n{{Main|Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones}}\nSet in June 2012, the film follows a Latino community in [[Oxnard, California]], where a group of high school graduates deal with the demon of a mysterious cult which has \"marked\" one of them. They document their experiences using basic tools of recording and with clues from the previous films to try to understand what is happening to them. ''The Marked Ones'' is the last film in the series to feature Katie Featherston.\n\n=== ''Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension'' (2015) ===\n{{Main|Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension}}\nSet in 2013, the film follows the Fleeges, a family of three who, after having relocated to a house in [[Santa Rosa, California]], discover several tapes that show Katie and Kristi in the midst of their initiation ritual to enter a demonic coven 25 years before. The family begins to be haunted by the demon when the daughter, Leila, is targeted as she was born on the same date as Hunter from ''Paranormal Activity 2''. Along with normal recorders, the family also discovers a unique video recorder that can show supernatural happenings, which they use to record the increasing paranormal activities.\n\n=== Untitled seventh film (2021) ===\nOn June 19, 2019, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] announced that a seventh installment is in development.<ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/paramount-blumhouse-seventh-paranormal-activity-movie-1203248018/|title=Paramount, Blumhouse Announce Seventh ''Paranormal Activity'' Movie|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=June 19, 2019|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref> On November 7, 2019, it was announced that the seventh film will be released on March 19, 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-sets-2021-dates-for-paranormal-activity-and-my-little-pony-films/|title=Paramount Sets 2021 Dates for ''Paranormal Activity'' and ''My Little Pony'' Films|first=Jeremy|last=Fuster|website=[[TheWrap]]|date=November 7, 2019|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and crew==\n===Cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Character\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Films\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[Paranormal Activity]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[Paranormal Activity 4]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones|{{small|Paranormal Activity:}}<br />The Marked Ones]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension|{{small|Paranormal Activity:}}<br />The Ghost Dimension]]''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:ivory;\" | <span style=\"color: black;\">{{small|2007}}</span>\n! style=\"background-color:ivory;\" | <span style=\"color: black;\">{{small|2010}}</span>\n! style=\"background-color:ivory;\" | <span style=\"color: black;\">{{small|2011}}</span>\n! style=\"background-color:ivory;\" | <span style=\"color: black;\">{{small|2012}}</span>\n! style=\"background-color:ivory;\" | <span style=\"color: black;\">{{small|2014}}</span>\n! style=\"background-color:ivory;\" | <span style=\"color: black;\">{{small|2015}}</span>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Katie\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | [[Katie Featherston]]\n| Katie Featherston\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Katie Featherston\n| Katie Featherston\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Chloe Csengery\n|-\n| [[Chloe Csengery]]<br>{{small|(young)}}\n| Chloe Csengery<br>{{small|(young)}}\n|-\n!

Peli took a year to prepare his own house for shooting, going so far as to repaint the walls, add furniture, put in a carpet, and build a stairwell. In this time, he also did extensive research into paranormal phenomena and [[demonology]], stating, \"We wanted to be as truthful as we could be.\" The decision to make the supernatural entity in the story a demon was a result of the research pointing to the most malevolent and violent entities being \"demons\". The phenomena in the film take place largely at night\u2014the vulnerability of being asleep, Peli reasoned, taps into a human being's most primal fear, stating, \"If something is lurking in your home there's not much you can do about it.\"\nAttempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a \"higher degree of plausibility\" was created for the audience and they were \"more invested in the story and the characters\". Peli says that the dialogue was \"natural\" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as \"retroscripting\" used in the making of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''. In casting the movie, Peli auditioned \"a few hundred people\" before finally meeting [[Katie Featherston]] and [[Micah Sloat]]. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, \"If you saw the footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years.\" During a guest appearance on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work.\nThe film was shot out of sequence due to Peli's self-imposed seven-day shooting schedule, though Peli would have preferred the story unfold for the actors as he had envisioned it. Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. \"It was a very intense week\", Peli recalled, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] hired screenwriter Michael R. Perry to create ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]''. Oren Peli, the director of the first film, served as a producer for this prequel. [[Kevin Greutert]], director of ''[[Saw VI]]'', was initially hired to direct the prequel; however, Lions Gate Entertainment exercised a clause in Greutert's contract to have him direct the [[Saw 3D|final film]] in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. Both of the actors from the first film, Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, reprise their roles in the [[prequel]]. [[Tod Williams (filmmaker)|Tod \"Kip\" Williams]] directed ''Paranormal Activity 2'', which started production in May 2010 and was released in October the same year.\n\n''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity 4|4]]'' were directed by [[Henry Joost]] and [[Ariel Schulman]], documentary filmmakers who were well-known for their feature debut ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]''. Production on the third entry began in June, 2011, with a release October 21 of the same year. Filming for the fourth film commenced in June, 2012, with a release of October 19.\n\nA [[Latin America]]n-themed fifth film, ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones]]'' was released on January 3, 2014. [[Oren Peli]], the creator of the franchise, returned to produce the film, while [[Christopher B. Landon]], a screenwriter who had worked on the prior three entries in the series, served as the writer and director.\n\nThe sixth and final film in the series, ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension]]'',<ref name=\"the-wrap\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/paranormal-activity-6-friday-the-13th-pushed-back-the-ring-reboot-gets-release-date/ | title=New \u2018Paranormal Activity,\u2019 \u2018Friday the 13th\u2019 Pushed Back; \u2018The Ring\u2019 Reboot Gets Release Date | last=Ge | first=Linda | work=[[TheWrap]] | date=January 27, 2015 | access-date=January 27, 2015}}</ref> was announced to be released on October 25, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paranormal-activity-5-release-date-393493 | title=Paramount Sets Release Date for 'Paranormal Activity 5' | last=Kilday | first=Gregg | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=November 20, 2012}}</ref> However, in August 2013, the release date was pushed back to October 24, 2014.<ref name=\"release\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/paramount-sets-dates-paranormal-activity-5-retitled-latino-spin-109521 | title=Paramount Sets Dates for 'Paranormal Activity 5,' Retitled Latino Spin-Off | website=[[TheWrap]] | date=August 8, 2013 | access-date=August 9, 2013}}</ref> On September 17, 2014, the film's title was finalized and the release date was set on March 27, 2015,<ref name=\"Ghost dimension\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/paranormal-activity-the-ghost-dimension-moved-to-2015-1201307744/ | title=\u2018Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\u2019 Moved to 2015 | last=Lang | first=Brent | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September 17, 2014 | access-date=September 17, 2014}}</ref> later changed to October 23, 2015.<ref name=\"the-wrap\" /> In September 2013, it was confirmed that Gregory Plotkin, a film editor who had edited every release in the series since ''Paranormal Activity 2'', would make his directorial debut with the fifth film.<ref name=\"Chavez, Kellvin\">{{cite web|url=http://latino-review.com/2013/09/gregory-plotkin-to-direct-paranormal-activity-5/ | title=Gregory Plotkin to Direct 'Paranormal Activity 5' | last= Chavez |first= Kellvin | publisher= Latino Review | date=September 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/09/gregory-plotkin-directing-paranormal-activity-5/|title=Gregory Plotkin Scares up Directing Debut on 'Paranormal 5.'|author=Fleming Jr., Mike|date=September 26, 2013|access-date=September 26, 2013}}</ref> [[Oren Peli]], the creator of the franchise, and [[Jason Blum]] would return to produce the fifth film.

Two prison guards died. Bill Miller was shot by Joe Cretzer, and Harold Stites was mistakenly shot by the officers on the hill outside who were firing into the D block.  Three inmates, Bernie Coy, Joe Cretzer and Marv Hubbard, were all killed  by countless rounds of rifle fire, grenades, tear gas and deck gun shells of the Coast Guard, US Marine Corps,  Prison and  Police Department. It was assumed that the inmates had obtain automatic rifles and the uprising was organized by six inmates :  Clarence Carnes Inmate 714-AZ, Bernard Coy Inmate 415-AZ, Sam Shockley Inmate 462-AZ, Miran Thompson Inmate 729-AZ, Joseph Paul Cretzer Inmate 548-AZ and Marvin Hubbard Inmate 645-AZ. Mainly by the bias of the sensation-loving press and media, they were already labeled killers.\n\n==Background==\nSam Shockley was the son of Richard \"Dick\" Shockley, and Annyer Eugenia Bearden, who died when Samuel was 7 years old.  He was born in Cerrogordo Caney Township, Little River County, Arkansas. His father was a sharecropper with eight children. By his first wife Norma Louise Bearden: Bryant Lunsford in 1889, and by Annyer Eugenia Bearden, his second wife: Myrtle Lee in 1900, Frank in 1901, Anna Belle in 1904, Patrick in 1907, Samuel Richard in 1909, and Ruth in 1913, Richard Samuel born in 1918 by his third wife, Sally Barton, who died of malaria fever in 1920. As a newborn baby, Sam survived an accident when his 9-year-old sister, Myrtle, looked after the children during the day, while their parents worked the land. The girl had Sam on her arm when she came too close to the fireplace and her dress caught fire. In panic, she ran out of the house, still holding Sam. There she threw Sam away and collapsed. Both children were lying outside for six hours, covered in burns.  Baby Sam had taken a hard blow from the fall.  Samuel Shockley was taken out of school by his father when he was twelve years old and strong enough to work  the fields. His formal education ended at the third grade, and by the age of thirteen he exhibited signs of serious instability. Sam started running away from home after the death of his stepmother. His father died in 1932. Sam left the family in 1927 and became a transient. Soon after he hit the road he was arrested for stealing chickens, automobile tires and accessories in [[Garvin County, Oklahoma|Garvin County]] and was sent for one year to the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]] at [[Granite, Oklahoma]]. \n\nWhile in prison Sam Shockley was beaten by a fellow inmate, suffering brain damage and numerous scars on his head and neck. He was released in July 1929, but he sustained a second beating by a police officer, which inflicted further head trauma. On June, 1936, Shockley married Betty Moore (born 1923 in Shoshone Idaho), but the marriage only lasted 1.5 years. They divorce on June 1939. Sam Shockley and Edward Johnson were arrested in March 1938 for robbing a man of his car, bank robbery and kidnapping Mr and Mrs D.F. Pendley, both employees of the bank of [[Paoli, Oklahoma]], and sentenced to life imprisonment at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]] on May 16, 1938. Examined by prison psychiatrists at Leavenworth, it was determined that Sam Shockley had a low [[IQ]] of 68 and the mental age of a 10-year 10-month-old child.  He suffered episodes of hallucinations and demonstrated serious emotional instability. He was incapable of coping with the normal prison environment, presenting a risk to himself and others. Rather than confine the obviously mentally deranged prisoner in the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners|Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] at [[Springfield, Missouri]], the administration of Leavenworth sent him to Alcatraz on September 23, 1938.\n\nWhen he was transferred to Alcatraz from Leavenworth, it was felt the strict routine there would better manage him. Throughout the early 1940s at Alcatraz, Sam Shockley's condition continued to deteriorate because he was placed for 3 years in the D block isolation section, and for most of the time in the Hole or Dungeon, the darkened stripped cells on the ground level. Here he spent most of his time in darkness.  At night, he was only allowed a blanket and a mattress, during the rest of the day he was sitting and lying on the cold concrete. He displayed classic schizophrenic symptoms: delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation. At Alcatraz,  Sam Shockley's mental condition worsened. His IQ dropped to 54, indicating a mental age of an eight-year-old child.  In 1942 the Alcatraz prison physician described Sam Shockley as emotionally very unstable with episodes of hallucinations. On 21 May 1941, there was an attempted escape from one of the island's workshops involving [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joe Cretzer]], Arnold \"Shorty\" Kyle, Lloyd Barkdoll (an Oregon bankrobber), and Sam Shockley. During the escape attempt from the mat shop, the men held a number of guards hostage. The convicts began sawing through the bars from the inside. After an hour, the convicts were unable to cut through the steel bars. The convicts surrendered after Captain [[Paul J. Madigan|Paul Madigan]], captain of the guard, arrived in the mat shop and the hostages were released unharmed. Lloyd Barkdoll managed to speak with Warden [[James A. Johnston|James Johnston]] and convinced him that  Shockley was not involved in the plot. Sam Shockley was released and sent back to his cell.\n\nOn May 2, 1946, during the escape the inmates [[Bernard Coy]], [[Joseph Cretzer]], and Marvin Hubbard took custodial guard Cecil Corwin by surprise. They opened the D isolation cell block door to free Rufus Whitey Franklin, who was still confined to the isolation cell and for all Coy knew, still in the darkened solitary cell behind two sets of doors; the outer door was made of solid steel and the inner door was electronically operated and barred.\n\nBernie Coy had planned to take control of the cell house and D block so that Rufus Franklin could be released once the escape was underway. Although it appeared to the inmates that they had all the cell house keys, none of them fit the lock in the rear door of the cell house which led to the recreation yard. It was through this door that the convicts intended to leave the cell house. The key 107 opened the rear door to the recreation yard but custodial guard Joseph Burdett hid this key under the wall seat of cell 404. The escape attempt failed due to the jamming of the recreation yard door lock, because if the wrong key was used and tried several times the system would block completely. All this turned into an armed confrontation which lasted 48 hours. Two custodial guards, Bill Miller and Harold Stites, and three inmates, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, were killed. Three guards were critically injured and 10 more guards sustained lesser injuries.\n\nLawyer William A. Sullivan, who was appointed by Judge [[Louis Earl Goodman|Louis Goodman]] to defend Sam Shockley in the Alcatraz Trial, elicited from Carl W. Sundstrom, custodial guard, that at no time did he ever see a weapon in Shockley's hands. Shockley did attack Sundstrom, but Sundstrom never was injured by him. Sundstrom also stated that Sam Shockley was running around and acting like a crazy man. Other inmates such as Jack Pepper, James Quillen, Howard Butler, Edwin Sharp and Louis Fleish made statements that Sam Shockley was running up and down the corridors carrying a wrench and wearing an officer's jacket several sizes too large for him. He looked like a clown, which amused the onlookers. He repeatedly swore at the hostages. Also the men all established that Shockley was in the D block when the shooting began that injured the guards taken hostage, and later killed guard W.H. Miller.\n\nJoseph Moyle, inmate 561-AZ, testified that Sam Shockley did not say anything; he was just standing at the hostage cells, and he did not think Sam Shockley knew what was going on. He, and other inmates who testified in court, denied that they ever heard Sam Shockley urge Joseph Cretzer to shoot the guards.  Sam Shockley was not a part of the plan at all and merely tagged along because no one told him he could not. If Sam Shockley was to have been a key figure in helping Bernie Coy enter the gun gallery, he would not have risked being placed in a solitary cell by smashing and setting fire to his cell in the riot of March 1946. If there had been enough solitary cells available, Sam Shockley was, like Rufus Franklin, locked up in one of these solitary cells. The failure to release Rufus Franklin was a good indication that no one in D Block had been aware of the break prior to its occurrence.  Joseph Moyle agreed to testify as an important defense witness but Sullivan got a letter, handed to him by Warden Johnston, in which Moyle declared that he no longer wished to be summoned as a witness in the court case because it would not be in his interest. With this, Sullivan lost one of his best witnesses in the case.\n\nA motion for a separate trial for each of the defendants, on the ground that they could not get a fair trial if they were tried together because the acts of each defendant would be considered by the jury to be acts of all, was denied by the judge. Also, a transfer of the trial, on the ground that the widespread adverse publicity and press coverage would prevent the defendants from obtaining a fair trial, Judge Goodman denied. A request for two lawyers to assist Sam Shockley was rejected, though in a weighty court case, where the death penalty can be demanded, it is very common that the defendant may take two lawyers for defense. Also, a request for an independent psychiatrist doctor to testify that Shockley was mentally ill  or insane was refused. Dr. Alden, the court-appointed psychiatrist, was the only medical witness to testify regarding the issue of Shockley's sanity. Dr. Alden had only an hour to examine Sam Shockley.\n\nThe [[Henri Young]] trial in 1941 has a lot of parallels with Sam Shockley's trial. Both were non-aggressive and mentally handicapped men. Both had been confined for lengthy periods of time in isolation and had long records of minor misbehaviors for which they suffered harsh punishments. Both men had almost complete lack of recall of the events for which they were on trial. [[Frank J. Hennessy|Frank Hennessy]], the U.S. Attorney, and Judge Goodman feared a second Henri Young trial, in which the jury publicly attacked Warden Johnston's administration as cruel and inhumane, and demanded that Alcatraz be closed and the Administration investigated by [[United States Marshals Service|Federal authorities]].\n\nSam Shockley, along with [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Clarence Carnes]], was found guilty of murder in the first degree at their trial December 21st 1946, before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Nineteen-year-old Clarence  \"Joe\" Carnes was spared the death penalty after some custodial officers who had been taken hostage testified that he had refrained from following instructions from Cretzer to kill them, but also due to the strong defense of his lawyer, Archer Zamloch. Although Sam Shockley's lawyer, W.A. Sullivan, pleaded insanity, Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson both received death sentences, to the great disbelief of their lawyers and even the prosecuting U.S. attorney, Hennessy. [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], a good friend of Warden Johnston, denied the bid for clemency. Sam Shockley accepted his fate and rejected any further efforts to stay the execution. They were executed simultaneously in the [[San Quentin]] [[gas chamber]] on December 3th 1948. Sam Shockley is buried at Pollard cemetery, [[Haworth, Oklahoma|Haworth]], [[McCurtain County, Oklahoma]].\n\n==General references==\n.   Inside Alcatraz, my time on the rock - by Jim Quillen.

Two prison guards died. Bill Miller was shot by Joe Cretzer, and Harold Stites was mistakenly shot by the officers on the hill outside who were firing into the D block.  Three inmates, Bernie Coy, Joe Cretzer and Marv Hubbard, were all killed  by countless rounds of rifle fire, grenades, tear gas and deck gun shells of the Coast Guard, US Marine Corps,  Prison and  Police Department. It was assumed that the inmates had obtain automatic rifles and the uprising was organized by six inmates :  Clarence Carnes Inmate no. 714, Bernard Coy Inmate no. 415, Sam Shockley Inmate no. 462, Miran Thompson Inmate no. 729, Joseph Paul Cretzer Inmate no. 548 and Marvin Hubbard Inmate no. 645. Mainly by the bias of the sensation-loving press and media, they were already labeled killers.\n\n==Background==\nSam Shockley was the son of Richard \"Dick\" Shockley, and Annyer Eugenia Bearden, who died when Samuel was 7 years old.  He was born in Cerrogordo Caney Township, Little River County, Arkansas. His father was a sharecropper with eight children. By his first wife Norma Louise Bearden: Bryant Lunsford in 1889, and by Annyer Eugenia Bearden, his second wife: Myrtle Lee in 1900, Frank in 1901, Anna Belle in 1904, Patrick in 1907, Samuel Richard in 1909, and Ruth in 1913, Richard Samuel born in 1918 by his third wife, Sally Barton, who died of malaria fever in 1920. As a newborn baby, Sam survived an accident when his 9-year-old sister, Myrtle, looked after the children during the day, while their parents worked the land. The girl had Sam on her arm when she came too close to the fireplace and her dress caught fire. In panic, she ran out of the house, still holding Sam. There she threw Sam away and collapsed. Both children were lying outside for six hours, covered in burns.  Baby Sam had taken a hard blow from the fall.  Samuel Shockley was taken out of school by his father when he was twelve years old and strong enough to work  the fields. His formal education ended at the third grade, and by the age of thirteen he exhibited signs of serious instability. Sam started running away from home after the death of his stepmother. His father died in 1932. Sam left the family in 1927 and became a transient. Soon after he hit the road he was arrested for stealing chickens, automobile tires and accessories in [[Garvin County, Oklahoma|Garvin County]] and was sent for one year to the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]] at [[Granite, Oklahoma]]. \n\nWhile in prison Sam Shockley was beaten by a fellow inmate, suffering brain damage and numerous scars on his head and neck. He was released in July 1929, but he sustained a second beating by a police officer, which inflicted further head trauma. On June, 1936, Shockley married Betty Moore (born 1923 in Shoshone Idaho), but the marriage only lasted 1.5 years. They divorce on June 1939. Sam Shockley and Edward Johnson were arrested in March 1938 for robbing a man of his car, bank robbery and kidnapping Mr and Mrs D.F. Pendley, both employees of the bank of [[Paoli, Oklahoma]], and sentenced to life imprisonment at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]] on May 16, 1938. Examined by prison psychiatrists at Leavenworth, it was determined that Sam Shockley had a low [[IQ]] of 68 and the mental age of a 10-year 10-month-old child.  He suffered episodes of hallucinations and demonstrated serious emotional instability. He was incapable of coping with the normal prison environment, presenting a risk to himself and others. Rather than confine the obviously mentally deranged prisoner in the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners|Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] at [[Springfield, Missouri]], the administration of Leavenworth sent him to Alcatraz on September 23, 1938.\n\nWhen he was transferred to Alcatraz from Leavenworth, it was felt the strict routine there would better manage him. Throughout the early 1940s at Alcatraz, Sam Shockley's condition continued to deteriorate because he was placed for 3 years in the D block isolation section, and for most of the time in the Hole or Dungeon, the darkened stripped cells on the ground level. Here he spent most of his time in darkness.  At night, he was only allowed a blanket and a mattress, during the rest of the day he was sitting and lying on the cold concrete. He displayed classic schizophrenic symptoms: delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation. At Alcatraz,  Sam Shockley's mental condition worsened. His IQ dropped to 54, indicating a mental age of an eight-year-old child.  In 1942 the Alcatraz prison physician described Sam Shockley as emotionally very unstable with episodes of hallucinations. On 21 May 1941, there was an attempted escape from one of the island's workshops involving [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joe Cretzer]], Arnold \"Shorty\" Kyle, Lloyd Barkdoll (an Oregon bankrobber), and Sam Shockley. During the escape attempt from the mat shop, the men held a number of guards hostage. The convicts began sawing through the bars from the inside. After an hour, the convicts were unable to cut through the steel bars. The convicts surrendered after Captain [[Paul J. Madigan|Paul Madigan]], captain of the guard, arrived in the mat shop and the hostages were released unharmed. Lloyd Barkdoll managed to speak with Warden [[James A. Johnston|James Johnston]] and convinced him that  Shockley was not involved in the plot. Sam Shockley was released and sent back to his cell.\n\nOn May 2, 1946, during the escape the inmates [[Bernard Coy]], [[Joseph Cretzer]], and Marvin Hubbard took custodial guard Cecil Corwin by surprise. They opened the D isolation cell block door to free Rufus Whitey Franklin, who was still confined to the isolation cell and for all Coy knew, still in the darkened solitary cell behind two sets of doors; the outer door was made of solid steel and the inner door was electronically operated and barred.\n\nBernie Coy had planned to take control of the cell house and D block so that Rufus Franklin could be released once the escape was underway. Although it appeared to the inmates that they had all the cell house keys, none of them fit the lock in the rear door of the cell house which led to the recreation yard. It was through this door that the convicts intended to leave the cell house. The key 107 opened the rear door to the recreation yard but custodial guard Joseph Burdett hid this key under the wall seat of cell 404. The escape attempt failed due to the jamming of the recreation yard door lock, because if the wrong key was used and tried several times the system would block completely. All this turned into an armed confrontation which lasted 48 hours. Two custodial guards, Bill Miller and Harold Stites, and three inmates, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, were killed. Three guards were critically injured and 10 more guards sustained lesser injuries.\n\nLawyer William A. Sullivan, who was appointed by Judge [[Louis Earl Goodman|Louis Goodman]] to defend Sam Shockley in the Alcatraz Trial, elicited from Carl W. Sundstrom, custodial guard, that at no time did he ever see a weapon in Shockley's hands. Shockley did attack Sundstrom, but Sundstrom never was injured by him. Sundstrom also stated that Sam Shockley was running around and acting like a crazy man. Other inmates such as Jack Pepper, James Quillen, Howard Butler, Edwin Sharp and Louis Fleish made statements that Sam Shockley was running up and down the corridors carrying a wrench and wearing an officer's jacket several sizes too large for him. He looked like a clown, which amused the onlookers. He repeatedly swore at the hostages. Also the men all established that Shockley was in the D block when the shooting began that injured the guards taken hostage, and later killed guard W.H. Miller.\n\nJoseph Moyle, inmate #561, testified that Sam Shockley did not say anything; he was just standing at the hostage cells, and he did not think Sam Shockley knew what was going on. He, and other inmates who testified in court, denied that they ever heard Sam Shockley urge Joseph Cretzer to shoot the guards.  Sam Shockley was not a part of the plan at all and merely tagged along because no one told him he could not. If Sam Shockley was to have been a key figure in helping Bernie Coy enter the gun gallery, he would not have risked being placed in a solitary cell by smashing and setting fire to his cell in the riot of March 1946. If there had been enough solitary cells available, Sam Shockley was, like Rufus Franklin, locked up in one of these solitary cells. The failure to release Rufus Franklin was a good indication that no one in D Block had been aware of the break prior to its occurrence.  Joseph Moyle agreed to testify as an important defense witness but Sullivan got a letter, handed to him by Warden Johnston, in which Moyle declared that he no longer wished to be summoned as a witness in the court case because it would not be in his interest. With this, Sullivan lost one of his best witnesses in the case.\n\nA motion for a separate trial for each of the defendants, on the ground that they could not get a fair trial if they were tried together because the acts of each defendant would be considered by the jury to be acts of all, was denied by the judge. Also, a transfer of the trial, on the ground that the widespread adverse publicity and press coverage would prevent the defendants from obtaining a fair trial, Judge Goodman denied. A request for two lawyers to assist Sam Shockley was rejected, though in a weighty court case, where the death penalty can be demanded, it is very common that the defendant may take two lawyers for defense. Also, a request for an independent psychiatrist doctor to testify that Shockley was mentally ill  or insane was refused. Dr. Alden, the court-appointed psychiatrist, was the only medical witness to testify regarding the issue of Shockley's sanity. Dr. Alden had only an hour to examine Sam Shockley.\n\nThe [[Henri Young]] trial in 1941 has a lot of parallels with Sam Shockley's trial. Both were non-aggressive and mentally handicapped men. Both had been confined for lengthy periods of time in isolation and had long records of minor misbehaviors for which they suffered harsh punishments. Both men had almost complete lack of recall of the events for which they were on trial. [[Frank J. Hennessy|Frank Hennessy]], the U.S. Attorney, and Judge Goodman feared a second Henri Young trial, in which the jury publicly attacked Warden Johnston's administration as cruel and inhumane, and demanded that Alcatraz be closed and the Administration investigated by [[United States Marshals Service|Federal authorities]].\n\nSam Shockley, along with [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Clarence Carnes]], was found guilty of murder in the first degree at their trial December 21st 1946, before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Nineteen-year-old Clarence  \"Joe\" Carnes was spared the death penalty after some custodial officers who had been taken hostage testified that he had refrained from following instructions from Cretzer to kill them, but also due to the strong defense of his lawyer, Archer Zamloch. Although Sam Shockley's lawyer, W.A. Sullivan, pleaded insanity, Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson both received death sentences, to the great disbelief of their lawyers and even the prosecuting U.S. attorney, Hennessy. [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], a good friend of Warden Johnston, denied the bid for clemency. Sam Shockley accepted his fate and rejected any further efforts to stay the execution. They were executed simultaneously in the [[San Quentin]] [[gas chamber]] on December 3th 1948. Sam Shockley is buried at Pollard cemetery, [[Haworth, Oklahoma|Haworth]], [[McCurtain County, Oklahoma]].\n\n==General references==\n.   Inside Alcatraz, my time on the rock - by Jim Quillen.
