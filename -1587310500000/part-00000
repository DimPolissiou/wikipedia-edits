The [[history of Vietnamese currency]], independent from [[China]], dates back to the [[\u0110inh dynasty]] period with the [[Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh H\u01b0ng B\u1ea3o]] (\u592a\u5e73\u8208\u5bf6), produced from 970 to 979. The Vietnamese produced [[Vietnamese cash|cash coins]] similar to the [[Cash (Chinese coin)|ones produced in China]] and circulated alongside Chinese, [[Japanese mon (currency)|Japanese]], [[Korean mun|Korean]], and [[Ryukyuan mon|Ryukyuan cash coins]] brought into the country through [[international trade]]. Cash coins continued to be produced in Vietnam [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o|until the 1940s]] under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]]. Through international trade foreign currencies such as [[Spanish dollar]]s and [[Mexican real]]s were brought into the country by merchants and these coins would continue to circulate in Vietnam until the [[French Indochina|French colonial administration]] outlawed their usage on 1 January 1906 in favour of [[French Indochinese piastre|their own coinage]], while Vietnamese cash coins were permitted to continue circulating. Despite the presence of coinages [[barter]] persisted until the [[20th century]]. Following its [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|declaration of independence]] in 1945 the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] started issuing [[North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng|its own currency]] in 1946, while allowing cash coins to circulate until 1948. In 1952 the piastre was abolished and replaced with the [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]] in [[South Vietnam|the south]] in 1953. Following Vietnamese reunification in 1976 the North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng and [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng#Second \u0111\u1ed3ng, 1975 to 1978|Liberation \u0111\u1ed3ng]] would continue to circulate in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam until May 2, 1978, when they were replaced by a new [[Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng|national currency]].\n\nThe coins uncovered in Vietnam includes both native coinages as well as Chinese cash coins in large numbers as [[Occupation of Vietnam by China|Vietnam was a part of China]] as well as through [[China\u2013Vietnam relations|historical trade with China]].\n\nVietnamese cash coins are also sometimes found in other countries because of trade, such as a [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] cash coin being unearthed in [[Hakodate]], [[Japan]].<ref name=\"Tr\u1ea7n-Dynasty-cash-coin-in-Japan\">{{cite web|url= https://japanarchaeology.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/hakodate-14th-century-tr%E1%BA%A7n-dynasty-vietnamese-coin-uncovered/|title= Hakodate \u2013 14th century Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty Vietnamese coin uncovered.|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=16 April 2020|author= Joseph Ryan|publisher= Japanese Archaeology|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\nIn modern Vietnam the supply of undiscovered [[Vietnamese cash|cash coins]] is rapidly declining as large amounts of Vietnamese cash coins were excavated during the 1980s and 1990s, in Vietnam the excavation of antiques such as cash coins is an industry in itself and the cash coins are mostly being dug up by farmers. After the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975 a large number of [[metal detector]]s numbering in the many thousands were left behind in the former area of [[South Vietnam]] which helped fuel the rise of this industry. The antique bronze industry is mostly concentrated in small rural villages where farmers rent metal detectors to search their own lands for bronze antiques to then either sell as scrap or to dealers, these buyers purchase lumps of cash coins by either kilogramme or ton to then hire skilled people to search through these lumps of cash coins for sellable specimens, these coins are then sold to other dealers in Vietnam, China, and Japan. During the zenith of the coin recovery business in Vietnam the number of bulk coins found on a monthly basis was fifteen tons but only roughly fifteen kilogrammes of those coins were sellable and the rest of the coins would melted down as [[scrap metal]]. As better metal detectors that could search deeper more Vietnamese cash coins were discovered but in modern times the supply of previously undiscovered Vietnamese cash coins is quickly diminishing.<ref>Sudokuone (Vietnam's Imperial History as Seen Through its Currency)  [http://vietnam.sudokuone.com/supply.htm The Supply of Vietnamese Coins] by Dr. R.

coins discovered in [[Vietnam]]. The [[history of Vietnamese currency]], independent from [[China]], dates back to the [[\u0110inh dynasty]] period with the [[Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh H\u01b0ng B\u1ea3o]] (\u592a\u5e73\u8208\u5bf6), produced from 970 to 979. The Vietnamese produced [[Vietnamese cash|cash coins]] similar to the [[Cash (Chinese coin)|ones produced in China]] and circulated alongside Chinese, [[Japanese mon (currency)|Japanese]], [[Korean mun|Korean]], and [[Ryukyuan mon|Ryukyuan cash coins]] brought into the country through [[international trade]]. Cash coins continued to be produced in Vietnam [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o|until the 1940s]] under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]]. Through international trade foreign currencies such as [[Spanish dollar]]s and [[Mexican real]]s were brought into the country by merchants and these coins would continue to circulate in Vietnam until the [[French Indochina|French colonial administration]] outlawed their usage on 1 January 1906 in favour of [[French Indochinese piastre|their own coinage]], while Vietnamese cash coins were permitted to continue circulating. Despite the presence of coinages [[barter]] persisted until the [[20th century]]. Following its [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|declaration of independence]] in 1945 the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] started issuing [[North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng|its own currency]] in 1946, while allowing cash coins to circulate until 1948. In 1952 the piastre was abolished and replaced with the [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]] in [[South Vietnam|the south]] in 1953. Following Vietnamese reunification in 1976 the North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng and [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng#Second \u0111\u1ed3ng, 1975 to 1978|Liberation \u0111\u1ed3ng]] would continue to circulate in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam until May 2, 1978, when they were replaced by a new [[Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng|national currency]]. \n\nThe coins uncovered in Vietnam includes both native coinages as well as Chinese cash coins in large numbers as [[Occupation of Vietnam by China|Vietnam was a part of China]] as well as through [[China\u2013Vietnam relations|historical trade with China]]. \n\nVietnamese cash coins are also sometimes found in other countries because of trade, such as a [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] cash coin being unearthed in [[Hakodate]], [[Japan]].<ref name=\"Tr\u1ea7n-Dynasty-cash-coin-in-Japan\">{{cite web|url= https://japanarchaeology.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/hakodate-14th-century-tr%E1%BA%A7n-dynasty-vietnamese-coin-uncovered/|title= Hakodate \u2013 14th century Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty Vietnamese coin uncovered.|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=16 April 2020|author= Joseph Ryan|publisher= Japanese Archaeology|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Overview == \n\nIn modern Vietnam the supply of undiscovered [[Vietnamese cash|cash coins]] is rapidly declining as large amounts of Vietnamese cash coins were excavated during the 1980s and 1990s, in Vietnam the excavation of antiques such as cash coins is an industry in itself and the cash coins are mostly being dug up by farmers. After the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975 a large number of [[metal detector]]s numbering in the many thousands were left behind in the former area of [[South Vietnam]] which helped fuel the rise of this industry. The antique bronze industry is mostly concentrated in small rural villages where farmers rent metal detectors to search their own lands for bronze antiques to then either sell as scrap or to dealers, these buyers purchase lumps of cash coins by either kilogramme or ton to then hire skilled people to search through these lumps of cash coins for sellable specimens, these coins are then sold to other dealers in Vietnam, China, and Japan. During the zenith of the coin recovery business in Vietnam the number of bulk coins found on a monthly basis was fifteen tons but only roughly fifteen kilogrammes of those coins were sellable and the rest of the coins would melted down as [[scrap metal]]. As better metal detectors that could search deeper more Vietnamese cash coins were discovered but in modern times the supply of previously undiscovered Vietnamese cash coins is quickly diminishing.<ref>Sudokuone (Vietnam's Imperial History as Seen Through its Currency)  [http://vietnam.sudokuone.com/supply.htm The Supply of Vietnamese Coins] by Dr. R.
