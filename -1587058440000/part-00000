Administrators can combine Postfix with other software that provides spam/virus filtering (e.g., [[Amavisd-new]]), message-store access (e.g., [[Dovecot (software)|Dovecot]]), or complex [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]-level access-policies (e.g., [http://www.postfwd.org postfwd], [[policyd-weight]] or [[greylisting]]).\n\nAs an [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] client, Postfix implements a high-performance parallelized mail-delivery engine. Postfix is often combined with [[Mailing list|mailing-list]] software (such as [[Mailman (GNU)|Mailman]]).\n\n==Operating systems==\n\nPostfix runs (or has run) on [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[BSD]], [[HP-UX]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and, generally speaking, on every [[Unix-like]] operating system that ships with a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]] and delivers a standard [[POSIX]] development environment. It is the default [[Message transfer agent|MTA]] for the\n[[macOS]], [[NetBSD]]<ref name=\"netbsd\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-mail.html\n  | title = The NetBSD Guide. Chapter 27. Mail and news\n  | accessdate = 2010-05-10\n}}</ref>\nand [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] operating systems.<ref name=\"ubuntu\">{{cite web\n  |url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Postfix\n  |title=Postfix\n  |publisher=Community Documentation, Ubuntu Wiki\n  |accessdate=2012-03-09\n}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\nPostfix consists of a combination of server programs that run in the background, and client programs that are invoked by [[User (computing)|user]] programs or by system administrators.\n\nThe Postfix core consists of several dozen [[Server (computing)|server]] programs that run in the background, each handling one specific aspect of email delivery. Examples are the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] server, the [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]], the address rewriter, and the local delivery server. For damage-control purposes, most server programs run with fixed reduced [[Privilege (computing)|privileges]], and terminate voluntarily after processing a limited number of requests. To conserve system resources, most server programs terminate when they become idle.\n\n[[Client (computing)|Client]] programs run outside the Postfix core. They interact with Postfix server programs through mail delivery instructions in the user's [[email forwarding|~/.forward]] file, and through small \"gate\" programs to submit mail or to request queue status information.\n\nOther programs provide administrative support to start or stop Postfix, query status information, manipulate the queue, or to examine or update its configuration files.\n\n[[File:Postfix architecture.svg|800px|center]]\n\n; Yellow ellipses: One of Postfix' many daemons serving exactly one purpose. This split-up into many smaller pieces of software is considered one of the reasons why Postfix is secure and stable.\n; Blue boxes: The blue boxes represent so-called ''lookup tables''. A lookup table consists of two columns (key and value) containing information used for access control, e-mail routing etc.\n; Yellow boxes: The yellow boxes are either mail queues or files. In either case, e-mails are stored on persistent media (e.g., a hard disk).\n; White clouds: The clouds stand for points at which e-mails enter or leave Postfix. For example, ''smtpd'' receives mail from other mail servers or users whereas ''smtp'' relays mail to other MTAs.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nThe Postfix implementation uses safe subsets of the [[C (programming language)|C]] language and of the [[POSIX]] system [[Application programming interface|API]]. These subsets are buried under an abstraction layer that contains about 50% of all Postfix source code, and that provides the foundation on which all Postfix programs are built. For example, the \"vstring\" primitive makes Postfix code resistant to [[buffer overflow]]<ref>{{\ncite book\n| last1 =  Honta\u00f1\u00f3n\n| first1 = Ram\u00f3n J\n| title = Linux Security\n| publisher = [[Sybex]]\n| date = July 10, 2001\n| location = San Francisco\n| page = 166\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wYBbM8ol2McC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=postfix+resilient+against+buffer+overflow\n| accessdate = 2011-09-21\n| isbn = 978-0-7821-2741-6\n}}</ref>\nattacks, and the \"safe open\" primitive makes Postfix code resistant to race condition attacks on systems that implement the [[POSIX]] file system\nAPI. This abstraction layer does not affect the attack resistance of non-Postfix code, such as code in system libraries or in third-party libraries.\n\n==Robustness==\n\nConceptually, Postfix manages [[Pipeline (software)|pipelines]] of processes that pass the responsibility for message delivery and error notification from one process to the next. All message and notification \"state\" information is persisted in the file system. The processes in a pipeline operate mostly without centralized control; this relative autonomy simplifies error recovery. When a process fails before completing its part of a file or protocol transaction, its predecessor in the pipeline backs off and retries the request later, and its successor in the pipeline discards unfinished work. Many Postfix daemons can simply \"die\" when they run into a problem; they are automatically restarted when the next service request arrives. This approach makes Postfix highly resilient, as long as the operating system or hardware don't fail catastrophically.\n\n==Performance==\n\nOne single Postfix instance has been clocked at ~300 message deliveries/second<ref name=\"groups.google.com\">{{cite web\n  | url = https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mailing.postfix.users/pPcRJFJmdeA\n  | title = Bulk Mailing Performance\n  | accessdate=2012-09-09\n}}</ref>\nacross the Internet, running on commodity hardware (a vintage-2003 [[Dell]] 1850 system with battery-backed MegaRAID controller and two [[SCSI]]\ndisks).

With mail systems such as [[Sendmail]] and [[Exim]] that make one connection at a time, high performance can be achieved by submitting limited batches of mail in parallel, so that each batch is delivered by a different process. Postfix and [[Qmail]] require parallel submission into different MTA instances once they reach their intrinsic performance limit, or the performance limits of the hardware or operating system.\n\nThe delivery rates cited above are largely theoretical. With bulk mail delivery, the true delivery rate is primarily determined by the receiver's mail receiving policies and by the sender's reputation.\n\n==Base configuration==\nThe [http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html main.cf] file stores site-specific Postfix configuration parameters while [http://www.postfix.org/master.5.html master.cf] defines daemon processes.<ref>[http://www.postfix-tutorial.com/ Postfix-Tutorial.com:  Postfix, Courier/POP, SASL & Spamassassin \u2013 with MySQL admin]\n</ref> The [http://www.postfix.org/BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.html Postfix Basic Configuration] tutorial covers the core settings that each site needs to consider, and the [http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html Postfix Standard Configuration Examples] document discusses configuration settings for a few common environments.

Administrators can combine Postfix with other software that provides spam/virus filtering (e.g., [[Amavisd-new]]), message-store access (e.g., [[Dovecot (software)|Dovecot]]), or complex [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]-level access-policies (e.g., [http://www.postfwd.org postfwd], [[policyd-weight]] or [[greylisting]]).\n\nAs an [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] client, Postfix implements a high-performance parallelized mail-delivery engine.

Examples are the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] server, the [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]], the address rewriter, and the local delivery server. For damage-control purposes, most server programs run with fixed reduced [[Privilege (computing)|privileges]], and terminate voluntarily after processing a limited number of requests. To conserve system resources, most server programs terminate when they become idle.\n\n[[Client (computing)|Client]] programs run outside the Postfix core. They interact with Postfix server programs through mail delivery instructions in the user's [[email forwarding|~/.forward]] file, and through small \"gate\" programs to submit mail or to request queue status information.\n\nOther programs provide administrative support to start or stop Postfix, query status information, manipulate the queue, or to examine or update its configuration files.\n\n[[File:Postfix architecture.svg|800px|center]]\n\n; Yellow ellipses: One of Postfix' many daemons serving exactly one purpose. This split-up into many smaller pieces of software is considered one of the reasons why Postfix is secure and stable.\n; Blue boxes: The blue boxes represent so-called ''lookup tables''. A lookup table consists of two columns (key and value) containing information used for access control, e-mail routing etc.\n; Yellow boxes: The yellow boxes are either mail queues or files. In either case, e-mails are stored on persistent media (e.g., a hard disk).\n; White clouds: The clouds stand for points at which e-mails enter or leave Postfix. For example, ''smtpd'' receives mail from other mail servers or users whereas ''smtp'' relays mail to other MTAs.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nThe Postfix implementation uses safe subsets of the [[C (programming language)|C]] language and of the [[POSIX]] system [[Application programming interface|API]]. These subsets are buried under an abstraction layer that contains about 50% of all Postfix source code, and that provides the foundation on which all Postfix programs are built. For example, the \"vstring\" primitive makes Postfix code resistant to [[buffer overflow]]<ref>{{\ncite book\n| last1 =  Honta\u00f1\u00f3n\n| first1 = Ram\u00f3n J\n| title = Linux Security\n| publisher = [[Sybex]]\n| date = July 10, 2001\n| location = San Francisco\n| page = 166\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wYBbM8ol2McC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=postfix+resilient+against+buffer+overflow\n| accessdate = 2011-09-21\n| isbn = 978-0-7821-2741-6\n}}</ref>\nattacks, and the \"safe open\" primitive makes Postfix code resistant to race condition attacks on systems that implement the [[POSIX]] file system\nAPI. This abstraction layer does not affect the attack resistance of non-Postfix code, such as code in system libraries or in third-party libraries.\n\n==Robustness==\n\nConceptually, Postfix manages [[Pipeline (software)|pipelines]] of processes that pass the responsibility for message delivery and error notification from one process to the next. All message and notification \"state\" information is persisted in the file system. The processes in a pipeline operate mostly without centralized control; this relative autonomy simplifies error recovery. When a process fails before completing its part of a file or protocol transaction, its predecessor in the pipeline backs off and retries the request later, and its successor in the pipeline discards unfinished work. Many Postfix daemons can simply \"die\" when they run into a problem; they are automatically restarted when the next service request arrives. This approach makes Postfix highly resilient, as long as the operating system or hardware don't fail catastrophically.\n\n==Performance==\n\nOne single Postfix instance has been clocked at ~300 message deliveries/second<ref name=\"groups.google.com\">{{cite web\n  | url = https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mailing.postfix.users/pPcRJFJmdeA\n  | title = Bulk Mailing Performance\n  | accessdate=2012-09-09\n}}</ref>\nacross the Internet, running on commodity hardware (a vintage-2003 [[Dell]] 1850 system with battery-backed MegaRAID controller and two [[SCSI]]\ndisks). This delivery rate is an order of magnitude below the \"intrinsic\" limit of 2500 message deliveries/second<ref name=\"groups.google.com\"/>\nthat was achieved with the mail queue on a RAM disk while delivering to the \"[http://www.postfix.org/discard.8.html discard]\" transport (with a dual-core [[Opteron]] system in 2007).\n\nMail systems such as Postfix and [[Qmail]] achieve high performance by delivering mail in parallel sessions.  With mail systems such as [[Sendmail]] and [[Exim]] that make one connection at a time, high performance can be achieved by submitting limited batches of mail in parallel, so that each batch is delivered by a different process. Postfix and [[Qmail]] require parallel submission into different MTA instances once they reach their intrinsic performance limit, or the performance limits of the hardware or operating system.\n\nThe delivery rates cited above are largely theoretical.

[[Gran Canaria]], with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after [[Majorca]] and Tenerife. The island of [[Fuerteventura]] is the second largest in the archipelago and located {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.\n\nThe islands form the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]] with the [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. The Canary Islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region.<ref name=\"catalogo.museosdetenerife.org\"/> The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.<ref>[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html (Universidad de Las Palmas,) Jos\u00e9 Mangas Vi\u00f1uela, \"The Canary Islands Hot Spot\"] This is the source for the geological history that follows.</ref>\n\nAccording to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east [[trade winds]], the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form [[laurisilva]] forests.\n\nAs a consequence, the individual islands in the Canary archipelago tend to have distinct [[microclimate]]s. Those islands such as [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]] and [[La Gomera]] lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist [[Canary Current]]. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. As one travels east toward the African coast, the influence of the current diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]], the islands which are closest to the African mainland, are effectively desert or semi desert. [[Gran Canaria]] is known as a \"continent in miniature\" for its diverse landscapes like [[Maspalomas]] and [[Roque Nublo]]. In terms of its climate [[Tenerife]] is particularly interesting. The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of [[Playa de las Americas]] and [[Los Cristianos]] is arid. The island rises to almost {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine ''[[Pinus canariensis]]'' thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]], ''[[Dracaena draco]]'' are endemic, as noted by [[Sabin Berthelot]] and [[Philip Barker Webb]] in their epic work, ''L'Histoire Naturelle des \u00celes Canaries'' (1835\u201350).\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[desert climate|desertic]], moderated by the sea and in summer by the [[trade winds]]. There are a number of [[microclimate]]s and the classifications range mainly from [[Hot semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[Desert climate|desert]]. According to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]],<ref>[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/World_Koppen_Map.png]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824032611/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/World_Koppen_Map.png |date=24 August 2015 }}</ref> the majority of the Canary Islands have a [[desert climate|hot desert climate]] represented as [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|BWh]]. There also exists a subtropical humid climate which is very influenced by the ocean in the middle of the islands of [[La Gomera]], [[Tenerife]] and [[La Palma]]; where the [[laurisilva]] forests grow.\n\nThe climate of the Canary Islands has been said to be one of the best in the world, with temperatures mostly between {{cvt|18|and|24|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite

All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic [[oceanic crust]] associated with the opening of the Atlantic. Underwater [[magmatism]] commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the [[Miocene]]. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the [[Atlas Mountains]] province, which in turn is part of the larger African Alpine System division.\n\nIn the summer of 2011 a series of low-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath El Hierro. These had a linear trend of northeast-southwest. In October a submarine eruption occurred about {{convert|2|km|mi|frac=4|abbr=on}} south of Restinga. This eruption produced gases and pumice, but no explosive activity was reported.\n\nThe following table shows the highest mountains in each of the islands:\n\n[[File:National Park de Tiede, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain - panoramio.jpg|right|thumb|Mount [[Teide]], the highest mountain in Spain, is also one of the most visited [[National Park]]s in the world.<ref name=\"diariodeavisos.com\">{{Cite web |publisher=Canaria de Avisos S.A. |url=http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2010/diariodeavisos/content/21463/ |title=El Teide, el parque m\u00e1s visitado de Europa y el segundo del mundo |website=Diariodeavisos.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926114624/http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2010/diariodeavisos/content/21463/ |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"sanborondon.info\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sanborondon.info/content/view/26362/1/ |title=El parque nacional del Teide es el primero m\u00e1s visitado de Europa y el segundo del mundo |website=Sanborondon.info |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924114109/http://www.sanborondon.info/content/view/26362/1/ |archivedate=24 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/islas-canarias/las-palmas-00386/noticia-teide-tenerife-parque-nacional-mas-visitado-canarias-28-millones-visitantes-2008-20090831192653.html |title=El Teide (Tenerife) es el parque nacional m\u00e1s visitado de Canarias con 2,8 millones de visitantes en 2008 |website=Europapress.es |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta+vacaciones+activas/Ocio/Durante+el+dia/Excursiones/EL+TEIDE.htm?Lang=es |title=Official Website of Tenerife Tourism Corporation |website=Webtenerife.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116025912/http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta%2Bvacaciones%2Bactivas/Ocio/Durante%2Bel%2Bdia/Excursiones/EL%2BTEIDE.htm?Lang=es |archivedate=16 January 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=left\n!rowspan=2| Mountain\n!colspan=2| Elevation\n!rowspan=2| Island\n|-\n! m\n! ft\n|-\n| [[Teide]]\n| {{convert|3718|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Tenerife]]\n|-\n| [[Roque de los Muchachos]]\n| {{convert|2426|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[La Palma]]\n|-\n| [[Pico de las Nieves]]\n| {{convert|1949|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Gran Canaria]]\n|-\n| [[Pico de Malpaso]]\n| {{convert|1501|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[El Hierro]]\n|-\n| [[Garajonay]]\n| {{convert|1487|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[La Gomera]]\n|-\n| Pico de la Zarza\n| {{convert|812|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Fuerteventura]]\n|-\n| Pe\u00f1as del Chache\n| {{convert|670|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Lanzarote]]\n|-\n| Aguja Grande\n| {{convert|266|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[La Graciosa]]\n|-\n| Caldera de Alegranza\n| {{convert|289|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Alegranza]]\n|-\n| Caldera de Lobos\n| {{convert|126|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Islote de Lobos|Lobos]]\n|-\n| La Mariana\n| {{convert|256|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Monta\u00f1a Clara]]\n|}\n\n=== Natural symbols ===\n{{Main|List of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands}}\nThe official natural symbols associated with Canary Islands are the bird ''[[Serinus canaria]]'' (canary) and the ''[[Phoenix canariensis]]'' palm.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html |title=Ley 7/1991, de 30 de abril, de s\u00edmbolos de la naturaleza para las Islas Canarias \u2013 in Spanish |website=Gobcan.es |date=10 May 1991 |accessdate=26 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808141931/http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html |archive-date=8 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Serinus canaria LC0210.jpg|''[[Serinus canaria]]''\nFile:Phoenix canariensis ag.JPG|''[[Phoenix canariensis]]''\n</gallery>\n\n=== National parks ===\n[[File:Caldera de Taburiente La Palma.jpg|thumb|[[Caldera de Taburiente National Park]] (La Palma).]]\n\nFour of Spain's thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands, more than any other autonomous community.

Morocco's official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do not authorise Spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries, since the Canary Islands enjoy a large degree of autonomy. In fact, the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the Spanish regions is considered an [[autonomous community]] with equal status to the European ones. {{citation needed span|text=Under the [[Law of the Sea]], the only islands not granted territorial waters or an [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) are those that are not fit for human habitation or do not have an economic life of their own, which is not the case of the Canary Islands.|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe boundary determines the ownership of seabed oil deposits and other ocean resources. Morocco and Spain have been unable to agree on a compromise regarding the territorial boundary, since neither nation wants to cede its claimed right to the vast resources whose ownership depends upon the boundary. In 2002, for example, Morocco rejected a unilateral Spanish proposal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html|title=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Canarian nationalism===\n{{main|Canarian nationalism}}\nThere are some pro-independence political parties, like the [[National Congress of the Canaries]] (CNC) and the [[Popular Front of the Canary Islands]], but these parties are non-violent, and their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the ''cabildos insulares''.\n\nAccording to a 2012 study by the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas]], when asked about national identity, the majority of respondents from the Canary Islands (49.3%) consider themselves Spanish and Canarian in equal measures, followed by 37.1% who consider themselves more Canarian than Spanish.

[[Lancelotto Malocello]] settled on Lanzarote in 1312.

From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. B\u00e9thencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognised King Henry III as his overlord.  It was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. Neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly Castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the Crown against the nobility.<ref>John Mercer, ''The Canary Islanders: their prehistory, conquest, and survival''  (1980).</ref>\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured native Guanche kings of [[Tenerife]] to the [[Catholic Monarchs]]]]\nHistorians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the Canary Islands:\n\nAristocratic conquest (''Conquista se\u00f1orial''). This refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility, for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the Crown of Castile, which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the Crown. One can identify within this period an early phase known as the Betancurian or Norman Conquest, carried out by [[Jean de Bethencourt]] (who was originally from Normandy) and [[Gadifer de la Salle]] between 1402 and 1405, which involved the islands of [[Lanzarote]], [[El Hierro]] and [[Fuerteventura]]. The subsequent phase is known as the Castilian Conquest, carried out by Castilian nobles who acquired, through purchases, assignments and marriages, the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of [[La Gomera]] around 1450.\n\nRoyal conquest (''Conquista realenga''). This defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496, carried out directly by the Crown of Castile, during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still unconquered: [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] and [[Tenerife]]. This phase of the conquest came to an end in the year 1496, with the dominion of the island of Tenerife, bringing the entire Canarian Archipelago under the control of the Crown of Castile.\n\n[[File:Columbus House-Vegueta-Las Palmas Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|Casa de Col\u00f3n (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria), which Christopher Columbus visited during his first trip.]]\nB\u00e9thencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was fully conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448 Maciot de B\u00e9thencourt sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal's Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the Castilians. Despite [[Pope Nicholas V#cite ref-8|Pope Nicholas V]] ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control, the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]], which settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic. This treaty recognized Castilian control of the Canary Islands but also confirmed Portuguese possession of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde islands]], and gave the Portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the Atlantic that might be discovered.\n\nThe Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, they did not achieve complete control until 1496, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].\n\n=== After the conquest ===\n[[File:Canary Islands map by William Dampier 1699 - Project Gutenberg eText 15675.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maps of the Canary Islands drawn by [[William Dampier]] during his voyage to [[Dutch West India Company|New Holland]] in 1699.]]\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Realm of Canary Islands.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the Castilian and Spanish Realm of Canary Islands]]\nAfter the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first [[sugarcane]]; then wine, an important item of trade with [[Kingdom of England|England]]. In this era, the first institutions of colonial government were founded. Gran Canaria, a colony of the [[Crown of Castile]] since 6 March 1480 (from 1556, of Spain), and Tenerife, a Spanish colony since 1495, each had its own governor. There has been speculation that the abundance of [[roccella tinctoria]] on the Canary Islands offered a profit motive for [[Jean de B\u00e9thencourt]] during his conquest of the islands. Lichen has been used for centuries to make dyes. This includes royal purple colors derived from roccella tinctoria, also known as orseille.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/12/12/dyeing-with-lichens-mushrooms/|work=blog.mycology.cornell.edu|author=Randi W.|title=Dyeing with Lichens & Mushrooms|date=December 12, 2006|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] became a stopping point for the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, traders, and missionaries on their way to the [[New World]]. This trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands. The islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe. Magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century. Civilian architecture survives in forms such as [[Casas de los S\u00e1nchez-Ochando]] or [[Casa Quintana]].\n\nThe Canaries' wealth invited attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[admiral]] and privateer [[Kemal Reis]] ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while [[Murat Reis the Elder]] captured Lanzarote in 1585.\n\nThe most severe attack took place in 1599, during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. A [[Dutch people|Dutch]] fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by [[Pieter van der Does]], attacked the capital Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.\n\nThe Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. They received 12 sheep and 3 calves. Furious, the Dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries, who were sheltering in the village of Santa Br\u00edgida. 300 Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, attempting to burn it down. The Dutch pillaged [[Maspalomas]], on the southern coast of Gran Canaria, [[San Sebasti\u00e1n de La Gomera|San Sebasti\u00e1n]] on La Gomera, and [[Santa Cruz de La Palma|Santa Cruz]] on La Palma, but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas and withdrew.\n\nIn 1618 the [[Barbary pirates]] attacked Lanzarote and La Gomera taking 1000 captives to be sold as [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]].<ref>[[John Mercer (archaeologist)|John Mercer]] (1980), ''The Canary Islanders : their prehistory, conquest, and survival'', p. 236, Collings.</ref> Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] was attacked by a British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm.\n\n=== 18th to 19th century ===\n[[File:Amaro Pargo.jpg|thumb|[[Amaro Pargo]] (1678\u20131741), [[Piracy|corsair]] and [[merchant]] from Tenerife who participated in the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] (the Spanish-American trade route).]]\nThe sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's [[Caribbean]] colonies. Low   sugar prices in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, [[cochineal]] (''cochinilla''), came into cultivation during this time, saving the islands' economy. During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum were sold in American ports such as [[Veracruz]], [[Campeche]], [[La Guaira]] and [[Havana]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/mirador/canarias/item/1721-el-comercio-canario-americano-en-el-siglo-xviii-i-parte|title=El comercio canario-americano en el siglo XVIII (I parte)|website=Canariascnnews.com|access-date=8 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707091632/http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/mirador/canarias/item/1721-el-comercio-canario-americano-en-el-siglo-xviii-i-parte|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, Canary Islanders had already emigrated to Spanish American territories, such as [[Havana]], [[Veracruz]], and [[Santo Domingo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm |title= The Spanish of the Canary Islands |website=Personal.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> [[San Antonio, Texas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/poc01 |title= Handbook of Texas Online \u2013 Canary Islanders |website=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.losislenos.org/ |title=Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage & Cultural Society website |website=Losislenos.org |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507222938/http://www.losislenos.org/ |archive-date=7 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |title=Isle\u00f1os Society of St. Bernard Parish |website=Americaslibrary.gov |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007110753/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |archivedate=7 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These economic difficulties spurred mass emigration during the 19th and first half of the 20th century, primarily to the Americas.

Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico.

In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travellers:\n* J. Edens, whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt. Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions.\n* [[Louis Feuill\u00e9e]] (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.\n* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide\n* the [[Nicolas Baudin|Baudin]]-Ledru expedition (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection of natural history objects.\n\nThe second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. Among these, the key exponents were the following:\n* [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1799)\n* [[Christian Leopold von Buch|Buch]] and [[Christen Smith (botanist)|Smith]] (1815)\n* [[Broussonet]]\n* [[Philip Barker Webb|Webb]]\n* [[Sabin Berthelot]].\n\nSirera and Renn identify the period 1770\u20131830 as one in which \"In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase\".\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Bahia luz las palmas 1912 jordao da luz perestello.jpg|thumb|The [[port of Las Palmas]] in 1912.]]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new [[cash-crop]], the [[banana]], the export of which was controlled by companies such as [[Fyffes]].\n\nThe rivalry between the elites of the cities of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the [[archipelago]] into two provinces in 1927. This has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities, which continues to this day.\n\nDuring the time of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], [[Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] workers' movements began to develop, led by figures such as Jose Miguel Perez and [[Guillermo Ascanio]]. However, outside of a few municipalities, these organisations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n=== Franco regime ===\n{{Main|Francoist Spain}}\nIn 1936, [[Francisco Franco]] was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of [[Vallehermoso, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Vallehermoso]], on La Gomera.

The bird life includes European and African species, such as the [[black-bellied sandgrouse]]; and a rich variety of [[endemism|endemic]] (local) taxa including the:\n* [[Atlantic canary|Canary]]\n* Graja, a subspecies of [[red-billed chough]] endemic to La Palma\n* [[Blue chaffinch]] (endemic to Tenerife and Gran Canaria)\n* [[Canary Islands chiffchaff]]\n* [[Fuerteventura chat]]\n* [[Tenerife goldcrest]]\n* [[La Palma chaffinch]]\n* [[Canarian Egyptian vulture]]\n* [[Bolle's pigeon]]\n* [[Laurel pigeon]]\n* [[Plain swift]]\n* [[Houbara bustard]]\n* [[Spider]]s\n* [[Snake]]s\n* [[Scorpion]]s\n* [[Canary Islands oystercatcher]] (extinct)\n\nTerrestrial fauna includes [[gecko]]s, [[wall lizards]], and three endemic species of recently rediscovered and [[critically endangered]] giant lizard: the [[El Hierro giant lizard]] (or [[Roque Chico de Salmor giant lizard]]), [[La Gomera giant lizard]], and [[La Palma giant lizard]]. Mammals include the [[Canarian shrew]], [[Canary big-eared bat]], the [[Algerian hedgehog]] (which may have been introduced) and the more recently introduced [[mouflon]]. Some endemic mammals, the [[lava mouse]], [[Tenerife giant rat]] and [[Gran Canaria giant rat]], are extinct, as are the [[Canary Islands quail]], [[long-legged bunting]], the [[eastern Canary Islands chiffchaff]] and the giant prehistoric tortoises; [[Geochelone burchardi]] and [[Geochelone vulcanica]].\n\n=== Marine life ===\n{{Main|Marine life of the Canary Islands}}\n[[File:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[loggerhead sea turtle]], by far the most common species of marine turtle in the Canary Islands.]]\nThe [[marine life]] found in the Canary Islands is also varied, being a combination of [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[endemism|endemic]] species. In recent years, the increasing popularity of both [[scuba diving]] and [[underwater photography]] have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands.\n\nFish species found in the islands include many species of [[shark]], [[Batoidea|ray]], [[moray eel]], [[Sparidae|bream]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[Grunt-fish|grunt]], [[scorpionfish]], [[triggerfish]], [[grouper]], [[goby]], and [[blenny]]. In addition, there are many invertebrate species, including [[sponge]], [[jellyfish]], [[anemone]], [[crab]], [[mollusc]], [[sea urchin]], [[starfish]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]] and [[coral]].\n\nThere are a total of five different species of [[marine turtle]] that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the [[endangered]] [[loggerhead sea turtle]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Lissie Wright |author2=Brian Groombridge |title=The IUCN Amphibia-reptilia Red Data Book|url=https://archive.org/details/iucnamphibiarept82groo|year=1982|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-88032-601-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/iucnamphibiarept82groo/page/140 140]}}</ref> The other four are the [[green sea turtle]], [[hawksbill sea turtle]], [[leatherback sea turtle]] and [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually [[wikt:migration|migrating]]. However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.\n\nMarine mammals include the large varieties of [[cetacean]]s including rare and not well-known species (see more details in the ''[[Marine life of the Canary Islands]]''). [[Hooded seals]]<ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/6204/0|title=Cystophora cristata (Hooded Seal)|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> have also been known to be vagrant in the Canary Islands every now and then.

It is the most famous and international festival of the archipelago. The carnival is celebrated in all the islands and all its municipalities, perhaps the two busiest are those of the two Canarian capitals; the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] (''Tourist Festival of International Interest'') and the [[Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. It is celebrated on the streets between the months of February and March. But the rest of the islands of the archipelago have their carnivals with their own traditions among which stand out: The Festival of the Carneros of [[El Hierro]], the Festival of the Diabletes of [[Teguise (municipality)|Teguise]] in [[Lanzarote]], Los Indianos de [[La Palma]], the Carnival of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n de La Gomera]] and the Carnival of [[Puerto del Rosario]] in [[Fuerteventura]].\n\n==Science and technology==\n[[File:Erdfunkstelle Gran Canaria-3.JPG|thumb|Gran Canaria space tracking station]]\nIn the 1960s, Gran Canaria was selected as the location for one of the 14 [[ground stations]] in the [[Manned Space Flight Network]] (MSFN) to support the [[NASA]] space program.

This may have come about from the shepherds of the islands who would challenge each other using their long walking sticks.<ref name=\"ctspanish.com\"/>\n\nFurthermore, there is the [[Salto del pastor|shepherd's jump]] (''salto del pastor''). This involves using a long stick to vault over an open area. This sport possibly evolved from the shepherd's need to occasionally get over an open area in the hills as they were tending their sheep.<ref name=\"ctspanish.com\"/>\n\nThe two main [[Association football|football]] teams in the archipelago are: the [[CD Tenerife]] (founded in 1912) and [[UD Las Palmas]] (founded in 1949).

There are smaller clubs also playing in the mainland [[Spanish football league system]], most notably [[UD Lanzarote]] and [[CD Laguna de Tenerife|CD Laguna]], although no other Canarian clubs have played in the top flight.\n\nThe mountainous terrain of the Canary Islands also caters to the growing popularity of [[ultra running]] and [[ultramarathons]] as host of annual competitive long-distance events including [[Transvulcania]] on [[La Palma]], Transgrancanaria<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.transgrancanaria.net/en/ |title=Transgrancanaria (English website) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> on [[Gran Canaria]] and the Half [[Marathon des Sables]] on [[Fuerteventura]].

[[Gran Canaria]], with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after [[Majorca]] and Tenerife. The island of [[Fuerteventura]] is the second largest in the archipelago and located {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.\n\nThe islands form the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]] with the [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. The Canary Islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region.<ref name=\"catalogo.museosdetenerife.org\"/> The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.<ref>[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html (Universidad de Las Palmas,) Jos\u00e9 Mangas Vi\u00f1uela, \"The Canary Islands Hot Spot\"] This is the source for the geological history that follows.</ref>\n\nAccording to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east [[trade winds]], the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form [[laurisilva]] forests.\n\nAs a consequence, the individual islands in the Canary archipelago tend to have distinct [[microclimate]]s. Those islands such as [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]] and [[La Gomera]] lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist [[Canary Current]]. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. As one travels east toward the African coast, the influence of the current diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]], the islands which are closest to the African mainland, are effectively desert or semi desert. [[Gran Canaria]] is known as a \"continent in miniature\" for its diverse landscapes like [[Maspalomas]] and [[Roque Nublo]]. In terms of its climate [[Tenerife]] is particularly interesting. The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of [[Playa de las Americas]] and [[Los Cristianos]] is arid. The island rises to almost {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine ''[[Pinus canariensis]]'' thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]], ''[[Dracaena draco]]'' are endemic, as noted by [[Sabin Berthelot]] and [[Philip Barker Webb]] in their epic work, ''L'Histoire Naturelle des \u00celes Canaries'' (1835\u201350).\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[desert climate|desertic]], moderated by the sea and in summer by the [[trade winds]]. There are a number of [[microclimate]]s and the classifications range mainly from [[Hot semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[Desert climate|desert]]. According to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]],<ref>[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/World_Koppen_Map.png]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824032611/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/World_Koppen_Map.png |date=24 August 2015 }}</ref> the majority of the Canary Islands have a [[desert climate|hot desert climate]] represented as [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|BWh]]. There also exists a subtropical humid climate which is very influenced by the ocean in the middle of the islands of [[La Gomera]], [[Tenerife]] and [[La Palma]]; where the [[laurisilva]] forests grow.\n\nThe climate of the Canary Islands has been said to be one of the best in the world, with temperatures mostly between {{cvt|18|and|24|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite

All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic [[oceanic crust]] associated with the opening of the Atlantic. Underwater [[magmatism]] commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the [[Miocene]]. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the [[Atlas Mountains]] province, which in turn is part of the larger African Alpine System division.\n\nIn the summer of 2011 a series of low-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath El Hierro. These had a linear trend of northeast-southwest. In October a submarine eruption occurred about {{convert|2|km|mi|frac=4|abbr=on}} south of Restinga. This eruption produced gases and pumice, but no explosive activity was reported.\n\nThe following table shows the highest mountains in each of the islands:\n\n[[File:National Park de Tiede, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain - panoramio.jpg|right|thumb|Mount [[Teide]], the highest mountain in Spain, is also one of the most visited [[National Park]]s in the world.<ref name=\"diariodeavisos.com\">{{Cite web |publisher=Canaria de Avisos S.A. |url=http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2010/diariodeavisos/content/21463/ |title=El Teide, el parque m\u00e1s visitado de Europa y el segundo del mundo |website=Diariodeavisos.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926114624/http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2010/diariodeavisos/content/21463/ |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"sanborondon.info\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sanborondon.info/content/view/26362/1/ |title=El parque nacional del Teide es el primero m\u00e1s visitado de Europa y el segundo del mundo |website=Sanborondon.info |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924114109/http://www.sanborondon.info/content/view/26362/1/ |archivedate=24 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/islas-canarias/las-palmas-00386/noticia-teide-tenerife-parque-nacional-mas-visitado-canarias-28-millones-visitantes-2008-20090831192653.html |title=El Teide (Tenerife) es el parque nacional m\u00e1s visitado de Canarias con 2,8 millones de visitantes en 2008 |website=Europapress.es |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta+vacaciones+activas/Ocio/Durante+el+dia/Excursiones/EL+TEIDE.htm?Lang=es |title=Official Website of Tenerife Tourism Corporation |website=Webtenerife.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116025912/http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta%2Bvacaciones%2Bactivas/Ocio/Durante%2Bel%2Bdia/Excursiones/EL%2BTEIDE.htm?Lang=es |archivedate=16 January 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=left\n!rowspan=2| Mountain\n!colspan=2| Elevation\n!rowspan=2| Island\n|-\n! m\n! ft\n|-\n| [[Teide]]\n| {{convert|3718|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Tenerife]]\n|-\n| [[Roque de los Muchachos]]\n| {{convert|2426|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[La Palma]]\n|-\n| [[Pico de las Nieves]]\n| {{convert|1949|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Gran Canaria]]\n|-\n| [[Pico de Malpaso]]\n| {{convert|1501|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[El Hierro]]\n|-\n| [[Garajonay]]\n| {{convert|1487|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[La Gomera]]\n|-\n| Pico de la Zarza\n| {{convert|812|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Fuerteventura]]\n|-\n| Pe\u00f1as del Chache\n| {{convert|670|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Lanzarote]]\n|-\n| Aguja Grande\n| {{convert|266|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[La Graciosa]]\n|-\n| Caldera de Alegranza\n| {{convert|289|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Alegranza]]\n|-\n| Caldera de Lobos\n| {{convert|126|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Islote de Lobos|Lobos]]\n|-\n| La Mariana\n| {{convert|256|m|ft|disp=table}}\n| [[Monta\u00f1a Clara]]\n|}\n\n=== Natural symbols ===\n{{Main|List of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands}}\nThe official natural symbols associated with Canary Islands are the bird ''[[Serinus canaria]]'' (canary) and the ''[[Phoenix canariensis]]'' palm.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html |title=Ley 7/1991, de 30 de abril, de s\u00edmbolos de la naturaleza para las Islas Canarias \u2013 in Spanish |website=Gobcan.es |date=10 May 1991 |accessdate=26 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808141931/http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html |archive-date=8 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Serinus canaria LC0210.jpg|''[[Serinus canaria]]''\nFile:Phoenix canariensis ag.JPG|''[[Phoenix canariensis]]''\n</gallery>\n\n=== National parks ===\n[[File:Caldera de Taburiente La Palma.jpg|thumb|[[Caldera de Taburiente National Park]] (La Palma).]]\n\nFour of Spain's thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands, more than any other autonomous community.

Morocco's official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do not authorise Spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries, since the Canary Islands enjoy a large degree of autonomy. In fact, the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the Spanish regions is considered an [[autonomous community]] with equal status to the European ones. {{citation needed span|text=Under the [[Law of the Sea]], the only islands not granted territorial waters or an [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) are those that are not fit for human habitation or do not have an economic life of their own, which is not the case of the Canary Islands.|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe boundary determines the ownership of seabed oil deposits and other ocean resources. Morocco and Spain have been unable to agree on a compromise regarding the territorial boundary, since neither nation wants to cede its claimed right to the vast resources whose ownership depends upon the boundary. In 2002, for example, Morocco rejected a unilateral Spanish proposal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html|title=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Canarian nationalism===\n{{main|Canarian nationalism}}\nThere are some pro-independence political parties, like the [[National Congress of the Canaries]] (CNC) and the [[Popular Front of the Canary Islands]], but these parties are non-violent, and their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the ''cabildos insulares''.\n\nAccording to a 2012 study by the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas]], when asked about national identity, the majority of respondents from the Canary Islands (49.3%) consider themselves Spanish and Canarian in equal measures, followed by 37.1% who consider themselves more Canarian than Spanish.

From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. B\u00e9thencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognised King Henry III as his overlord.  It was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. Neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly Castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the Crown against the nobility.<ref>John Mercer, ''The Canary Islanders: their prehistory, conquest, and survival''  (1980).</ref>\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured native Guanche kings of [[Tenerife]] to the [[Catholic Monarchs]]]]\nHistorians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the Canary Islands:\n\nAristocratic conquest (''Conquista se\u00f1orial''). This refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility, for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the Crown of Castile, which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the Crown. One can identify within this period an early phase known as the Betancurian or Norman Conquest, carried out by [[Jean de Bethencourt]] (who was originally from Normandy) and [[Gadifer de la Salle]] between 1402 and 1405, which involved the islands of [[Lanzarote]], [[El Hierro]] and [[Fuerteventura]]. The subsequent phase is known as the Castilian Conquest, carried out by Castilian nobles who acquired, through purchases, assignments and marriages, the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of [[La Gomera]] around 1450.\n\nRoyal conquest (''Conquista realenga''). This defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496, carried out directly by the Crown of Castile, during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still unconquered: [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] and [[Tenerife]]. This phase of the conquest came to an end in the year 1496, with the dominion of the island of Tenerife, bringing the entire Canarian Archipelago under the control of the Crown of Castile.\n\n[[File:Columbus House-Vegueta-Las Palmas Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|Casa de Col\u00f3n (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria), which Christopher Columbus visited during his first trip.]]\nB\u00e9thencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was fully conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448 Maciot de B\u00e9thencourt sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal's Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the Castilians. Despite [[Pope Nicholas V#cite ref-8|Pope Nicholas V]] ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control, the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]], which settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic. This treaty recognized Castilian control of the Canary Islands but also confirmed Portuguese possession of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde islands]], and gave the Portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the Atlantic that might be discovered.\n\nThe Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, they did not achieve complete control until 1496, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].\n\n=== After the conquest ===\n[[File:Canary Islands map by William Dampier 1699 - Project Gutenberg eText 15675.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maps of the Canary Islands drawn by [[William Dampier]] during his voyage to [[Dutch West India Company|New Holland]] in 1699.]]\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Realm of Canary Islands.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the Castilian and Spanish Realm of Canary Islands]]\nAfter the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first [[sugarcane]]; then wine, an important item of trade with [[Kingdom of England|England]]. In this era, the first institutions of colonial government were founded. Gran Canaria, a colony of the [[Crown of Castile]] since 6 March 1480 (from 1556, of Spain), and Tenerife, a Spanish colony since 1495, each had its own governor. There has been speculation that the abundance of [[roccella tinctoria]] on the Canary Islands offered a profit motive for [[Jean de B\u00e9thencourt]] during his conquest of the islands. Lichen has been used for centuries to make dyes. This includes royal purple colors derived from roccella tinctoria, also known as orseille.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/12/12/dyeing-with-lichens-mushrooms/|work=blog.mycology.cornell.edu|author=Randi W.|title=Dyeing with Lichens & Mushrooms|date=December 12, 2006|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] became a stopping point for the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, traders, and missionaries on their way to the [[New World]]. This trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands. The islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe. Magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century. Civilian architecture survives in forms such as [[Casas de los S\u00e1nchez-Ochando]] or [[Casa Quintana]].\n\nThe Canaries' wealth invited attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[admiral]] and privateer [[Kemal Reis]] ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while [[Murat Reis the Elder]] captured Lanzarote in 1585.\n\nThe most severe attack took place in 1599, during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. A [[Dutch people|Dutch]] fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by [[Pieter van der Does]], attacked the capital Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.\n\nThe Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth.

In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travellers:\n* J. Edens, whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt. Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions.\n* [[Louis Feuill\u00e9e]] (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.\n* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide\n* the [[Nicolas Baudin|Baudin]]-Ledru expedition (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection of natural history objects.\n\nThe second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives.

He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the [[Spanish Civil War]].

Both types can transport large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles). Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel relatively quickly (in excess of {{cvt|30|knot|km/h mph||}}) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some{{clarify|reason=does \"some\" mean \"approximately\"?

It is celebrated on the streets between the months of February and March.

If he succeeded and built the Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: \"For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all proclaim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9).\"<ref>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4</ref>}}\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\"/>\n\nA common modern [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The [[Talmud]], which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|95:7|HE}}</ref>\n\nA [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace, Messiah ben David, will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then [[Armilus]], according to one group of sources, or [[Gog and Magog]], according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Messiah |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah |year=1906 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Chabad ===\n{{further information|Chabad messianism|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies|List of Jewish messiah claimants}}\n[[File:Psak din messiah.jpg|thumb|right|Chabad Halachic ruling declaring \"every single Jew\" had to believe in the imminent second coming of the deceased 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe as the Messiah<ref name=\"DVED-250\"/>]]\n\n[[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth ''[[Rebbe]]'' (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch,<ref name=\"LubavitcherFalseMessiahs\"/><ref name=\"MS-HabadMinuth\"/> and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh ''Rebbe'' of Chabad,<ref name=\"SHandelman\">Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.

In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be [[God]] or a pre-existent divine [[Son of God]]. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David. That is why he is referred to as [[Messiah ben David]], which means \"Messiah, son of David\". The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|publisher=Jewfaq.org|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:3-4|HE}}</ref>\n\nBelief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMaimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:\n{{quote|And if a king shall arise from among the House of David, studying Torah and occupied with commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will impel all of Israel to follow it and to strengthen breaches in its observance, and will fight God's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded and built the Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: \"For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all proclaim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9).\"<ref>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4</ref>}}\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\"/>\n\nA common modern [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The [[Talmud]], which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|95:7|HE}}</ref>\n\nA [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace, Messiah ben David, will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then [[Armilus]], according to one group of sources, or [[Gog and Magog]], according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Messiah |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah |year=1906 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Chabad ===\n{{further information|Chabad messianism|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies|List of Jewish messiah claimants}}\n[[File:Psak din messiah.jpg|thumb|right|Chabad Halachic ruling declaring \"every single Jew\" had to believe in the imminent second coming of the deceased 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe as the Messiah<ref name=\"DVED-250\"/>]]\n\n[[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth ''[[Rebbe]]'' (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch,<ref name=\"LubavitcherFalseMessiahs\"/><ref name=\"MS-HabadMinuth\"/> and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh ''Rebbe'' of Chabad,<ref name=\"SHandelman\">Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.
