He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homer embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, selfish, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homer embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, selfish, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

The wide-ranging types of workplace harassment can be loosely categorized into emotional and physical abuse.

Workplace harassment may also consist of offensive conduct based on one or more of the protected groups above that is so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as being fired or demoted).\"<ref name=\"DoL\" /> Thus, workplace harassment is a bigger category that encompasses sexual harassment.\n\n==In the United States==\n\n===Types===\nThe vastly different harassments imposed on the victims can be categorized into two different types, physical abuse and emotional abuse. Physical abuse refers to sexual assault and violence on body, while emotional abuse refers to imposing stress and bullying.  Anderson and Militello found that often managers exhibiting [[Abusive supervision|harassing behavior]] were allowed to maintain their jobs because their behavior was seen to increase productivity in the short term.  A study done by Kathleen D. Ryan and Daniel K Oestereich, ''Driving Fear Out of the Workplace'', found that many of these behaviors can range from subtle emotional cues to outward physical threats and can include; silence, direct insults and even angry outbursts.  Whether these actions are intentional or brought on by stress, the result can cause the employee to feel humiliated, isolated and may cause them to lash out at others.<ref>{{citation | last = Layden | first = Dianne R. | contribution = Violence, the emotionally enraged employee, and the workplace: managerial considerations | editor-last1 = Curry | editor-first1 = Ren\u00e9e R. | editor-last2 = Allison | editor-first2 = Terry L. | title = States of rage: emotional eruption, violence and social change | pages = 48\u201349 | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York, New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780814715307 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\n====Physical harassment====\n[[File:Anita Hill at Harvard Law School Sep 2014.jpg|thumb|Anita Hill testified her charge against Clarence Thomas for sexually harassing her at the Department of Education and the EEOC.]]\nPhysical harassment in the workplace takes many forms.

Sexual assault becomes difficult to define, as the distinction between sexual harassment and consensual sexual behaviors is not finely delineated.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Some occupations require a higher tolerance to sexual behaviors, such as waitresses and tour guides.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> More specifically, the employers for these occupations expect the workers to comply with the level of sexual interactions the workers would have with the customers.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> This unquestioned expectation from the employers then pushes the workers to see only two options. The workers would have to accept the sexual harassment from customers as \"part of the job\", or report the sexual harassment to the manager and get fired.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Adding onto the pressure, reporting sexual assault comes with criticism from co-workers, as they see the sexual assault as part of the job requirement.<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n{{see also|Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States}}\nThe prevalence of sexual harassment at work is high. For example, a study by the [[U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board]] in 1981 shows that among the female government employees, 33 percent experienced sexual comments, 26 percent had unwanted physical touching, and 15 percent was pressured for dates.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\">{{Cite journal | last = Fitzgerald | first = Louise F. | title = Sexual harassment: violence against women in the workplace | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 48 | issue = 10 | pages = 1070\u20131076 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.48.10.1070 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref> Moreover, \"Nearly 10% had been directly pressured for sexual cooperation, and a similar percentage described repeated telephone calls and unwelcome letters or notes.\"<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> Other than this example, Fitzgerald states that \"the enormity of such figures is difficult to grasp, indicating as they do that virtually millions of women are subjected to experiences ranging from insults to assault\u2014many on an ongoing or recurrent basis\u2014 as the price of earning a living.\"<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" />\n\nAnother form of physical harassment at work is workplace violence.

The most common form of workplace harassment that women face is sexual harassment.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> According to Fitzgerald, one of every two women experiences workplace harassment in their working or academic lives.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> The most common form of sexual harassment is the unwanted and unavoidable sexual attention from co-workers.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> A study of government employees shows the inescapable, uncomfortable sexual attention takes varying forms.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> 33% of respondents had been called by sexual remarks, 26% of respondents faced physical touching, and 15% respondents were pressured to go on a date.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> The more explicit forms of sexual harassment are shown by court cases, such as [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson|Meritor v. Vinson]] (1986), Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards (1991), and others.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> In Meritor v. Vinson, \"Michele Vinson, an employee of Meritor Savings Bank, was forced to have sex with her boss between 40 and 50 times.\"<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> The boss harassed her by fondling her in public, following her to the bathroom, and frequently raping her.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> In Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Robinson requested to put down the pornographic materials in Jacksonville Shipyard workplace. The pornographic material included \"a pinup showing a meat spatula pressed against a woman's pubic area and another featuring a nude woman holding a whip.\"<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" />\n\nWhile workplace harassment against women has been a frequent subject of study for more than 20 years, workplace harassment against men rarely receives attention and is not subjected to many studies.<ref

simple assault.<ref name=\"Warchol\" />\n\n====Sexuality====\nThe Williams Institute 2011 study shows that \"In the American workforce, more than eight million people (or 4 percent of the U.S. workforce) identify as [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender]] (LGBT).\"<ref name=\"Pizer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pizer | first1 = Jennifer C. | last2 = Sears | first2 = Brad | last3 =

of workplace harassment is direct harassment from the public after disclosing one's sexuality.<ref name=\"Probst\" /> Because an LGBT individual experiences explicit verbal assault, physical violence, and hate crimes after disclosing sexuality, the LGBT community more often than not conceals its sexuality in workplaces.<ref name=\"Probst\" />\n\n====Race====\nMany studies show that culturally stigmatized groups face more workplace harassments.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite journal | last1 = Deitch | first1 = Elizabeth A. | last2 = Barsky | first2 = Adam | last3 = Butz | first3 = Rebecca M. |

Barsky, Butz and et al. shows that black Americans face more mistreatment in workplaces than white Americans.<ref name=\"Deitch\" /> The mistreatments and harassments do not explicitly \"reference race or discrimination as the cause of the treatment\", because overt racism is prohibited in workplaces.<ref name=\"Deitch\" /> However, the statistics show race is \"significantly associated with mistreatment\" and that black Americans in general report significantly more \"minor, pervasive mistreatment and unfairness on the job.\"<ref name=\"Deitch\" /> The study suggests the discrimination and harassments may intensify for Black Americans in a job with fewer people of the same race, such as \"token\" Black employee or \"solo\" employees.<ref name=\"Deitch\" /> In addition, not only Blacks but also Asian Americans, and other minority races all face \"a higher rate of homicide than their proportion of the work force would suggest.\"<ref name=\"Toscano\">{{citation | last1 =

negative social distress faced in workplaces is linked with increased consumption of alcohol.<ref name=\"Richman\" /> Moreover, because workplace harassment cannot be clearly delineated like sexual or racial harassment, victims do not counteract by legal and institution responses.<ref name=\"Richman\" /> Rather, they rely on drinking to cope with the emotional distress.<ref name=\"Richman\" />\n\nNolen-Hoeksema and Harrell's 2002 study shows that while both women and men are at risk of alcoholism under workplace harassment, men are more likely to cope by drinking than women do, as women

Mikklesen and Einarsen also reports that 76 percent of its respondents experienced PTSD.<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Nevertheless, Mikklesen and Einarsen qualify the idea that workplace harassment directly leads to PTSD.<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> They argue that the causes of PTSD symptoms of the victims are primarily attributed to other traumatic events rather than the workplace harassment itself.<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Therefore, the study concludes the \"exposure to other traumatic life events may increase victims' vulnerability\" to their sensitivity to workplace harassment.<ref

In essence, workplace harassment requires a pluralistic understanding, because it cannot be delineated in one coherent and concrete definition.<ref name=\"Brooks\">{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = Rosa Ehrenreich | title = Dignity and discrimination: toward a pluralistic understanding of workplace harassment | journal = [[Georgetown Law Journal]] | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 14\u201320 | date = 1999 | url = http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/1134/ | ref = harv }} [http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2143&context=facpub Pdf.]</ref>\n\nAcknowledging the difficulty of formulating a universal definition of workplace harassment, Ezer broadly defines workplace harassment as \"irrational repeated behavior towards an employee or group of employees, which represents a health and security risk.<ref name=\"Ezer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ezer | first1 = Marius | last2 = Ezer | first2 = Oana Florentina | title = Workplace harassment, mobbing phenomenon | journal = Perspectives of Business Law Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 298\u2013304 | date = November 2012 | url = http://www.businesslawconference.ro/revista/anul1nr1.html | ref = harv }} [http://www.businesslawconference.ro/revista/articole/an1nr1/33%20Marius%20Ezer%20si%20Oana%20Ezer%20Eng.pdf Pdf.]</ref> Any act of discrimination or assault that systematically disadvantage the employees is considered workplace harassment.<ref name=\"Ezer\" /> Workplace harassment can contribute to deterioration of physical and emotional health.<ref name=\"Ezer\" />\n\nAccording to Rosa Brook, the concept of workplace harassment is based on two premises.<ref name=\"Brooks\" /> Firstly, regardless of gender, race, sexuality or any other defining characteristic, every person should be given the right to be \"free from abusive treatment in the workplace\".<ref name=\"Brooks\" /> With freedom from abuse given as a basic human right, any form of discomfort or discrimination in workplace becomes labeled as an act of harassment.<ref name=\"Brooks\" /> Secondly, the issues caused by workplace harassment affect the victims in harmful ways. Discrimination in the workplace hinders victims from successful advancement in their careers, limiting the capabilities of the victim.<ref name=\"Brooks\" />\n\nA common misconception about workplace harassment is that workplace harassment is simply [[sexual harassment]] in the context of a workplace.<ref name=\"DoL\">{{cite web | last = U.S. Department of Labor | author-link = United States Department of Labor | title = What do I need to know about \u2013 workplace harassment | url = http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/crc/2011-workplace-harassment.htm | website = dol.gov | publisher = [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] | access-date = March 17, 2015 }}</ref> While sexual harassment is a prominent form of workplace harassment, the United States Department of Labor defines workplace harassment as being more than just sexual harassment.<ref name=DoL /> \"It may entail '[[Quid pro quo|quid pro quo']] harassment, which occurs in cases in which employment decisions or treatment are based on submission to or rejection of unwelcome conduct, typically conduct of a sexual nature. Workplace harassment may also consist of offensive conduct based on one or more of the protected groups above that is so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as being fired or demoted).\"<ref name=\"DoL\" /> Thus, workplace harassment is a bigger category that encompasses sexual harassment.\n\n==In the United States==\n\n===Types===\nThe vastly different harassments imposed on the victims can be categorized into two different types, physical abuse and emotional abuse. Physical abuse refers to sexual assault and violence on body, while emotional abuse refers to imposing stress and bullying.  Anderson and Militello found that often managers exhibiting [[Abusive supervision|harassing behavior]] were allowed to maintain their jobs because their behavior was seen to increase productivity in the short term.  A study done by Kathleen D. Ryan and Daniel K Oestereich, ''Driving Fear Out of the Workplace'', found that many of these behaviors can range from subtle emotional cues to outward physical threats and can include; silence, direct insults and even angry outbursts.  Whether these actions are intentional or brought on by stress, the result can cause the employee to feel humiliated, isolated and may cause them to lash out at others.<ref>{{citation | last = Layden | first = Dianne R. | contribution = Violence, the emotionally enraged employee, and the workplace: managerial considerations | editor-last1 = Curry | editor-first1 = Ren\u00e9e R. | editor-last2 = Allison | editor-first2 = Terry L. | title = States of rage: emotional eruption, violence and social change | pages = 48\u201349 | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York, New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780814715307 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\n====Physical harassment====\n[[File:Anita Hill at Harvard Law School Sep 2014.jpg|thumb|Anita Hill testified her charge against Clarence Thomas for sexually harassing her at the Department of Education and the EEOC.]]\nPhysical harassment in the workplace takes many forms.

Sexual assault becomes difficult to define, as the distinction between sexual harassment and consensual sexual behaviors is not finely delineated.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Some occupations require a higher tolerance to sexual behaviors, such as waitresses and tour guides.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> More specifically, the employers for these occupations expect the workers to comply with the level of sexual interactions the workers would have with the customers.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> This unquestioned expectation from the employers then pushes the workers to see only two options. The workers would have to accept the sexual harassment from customers as \"part of the job\", or report the sexual harassment to the manager and get fired.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Adding onto the pressure, reporting sexual assault comes with criticism from co-workers, as they see the sexual assault as part of the job requirement.<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n{{see also|Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States}}\nThe prevalence of sexual harassment at work is high. For example, a study by the [[U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board]] in 1981 shows that among the female government employees, 33 percent experienced sexual comments, 26 percent had unwanted physical touching, and 15 percent was pressured for dates.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\">{{Cite journal | last = Fitzgerald | first = Louise F. | title = Sexual harassment: violence against women in the workplace | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 48 | issue = 10 | pages = 1070\u20131076 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.48.10.1070 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref> Moreover, \"Nearly 10% had been directly pressured for sexual cooperation, and a similar percentage described repeated telephone calls and unwelcome letters or notes.\"<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> Other than this example, Fitzgerald states that \"the enormity of such figures is difficult to grasp, indicating as they do that virtually millions of women are subjected to experiences ranging from insults to assault\u2014many on an ongoing or recurrent basis\u2014 as the price of earning a living.\"<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" />\n\nAnother form of physical harassment at work is workplace violence.

While one group experiences workplace harassment more frequently than others, workplace harassment still affects wide range of population.\n\n====Gender====\nBoth men and women are victims of workplace harassment. Workplace harassment for women dates back to women's first foray into the workforce, as early as colonial times. The most common form of workplace harassment that women face is sexual harassment.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> According to Fitzgerald, one of every two women experiences workplace harassment in their working or academic lives.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> The most common form of sexual harassment is the unwanted and unavoidable sexual attention from co-workers.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> A study of government employees shows the inescapable, uncomfortable sexual attention takes varying forms.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> 33% of respondents had been called by sexual remarks, 26% of respondents faced physical touching, and 15% respondents were pressured to go on a date.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> The more explicit forms of sexual harassment are shown by court cases, such as [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson|Meritor v. Vinson]] (1986), Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards (1991), and others.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> In Meritor v. Vinson, \"Michele Vinson, an employee of Meritor Savings Bank, was forced to have sex with her boss between 40 and 50 times.\"<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> The boss harassed her by fondling her in public, following her to the bathroom, and frequently raping her.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> In Robinson v.

Mikklesen and Einarsen also reports that 76 percent of its respondents experienced PTSD.<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Nevertheless, Mikklesen and Einarsen qualify the idea that workplace harassment directly leads to PTSD.<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> They argue that the causes of PTSD symptoms of the victims are primarily attributed to other traumatic events rather than the workplace harassment
