Senator]] from [[West Virginia]], a seat he has held since 2010. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was the 34th [[governor of West Virginia]] from 2005 to 2010 and the 27th [[secretary of state of West Virginia]] from 2001 to 2005.\n\nManchin is a conservative Democrat who has continued to win elections in West Virginia even though the state now leans heavily Republican.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/24/451336317/west-virginia-tells-the-story-of-americas-shifting-political-climate |title=West Virginia Tells The Story Of America's Shifting Political Climate |first=Don |last=Gonyea |author-link=Don Gonyea |date=October 24, 2015 |website=[[NPR]]}}</ref> He won the [[2004 West Virginia gubernatorial election|2004 gubernatorial election]] by a large margin and was reelected by an even larger margin in [[2008 West Virginia gubernatorial election|2008]]; in both years, Republican presidential candidates won West Virginia. Manchin won the special election with 54% of the vote [[2010 United States Senate special election in West Virginia|in 2010]] to fill the Senate seat vacated by incumbent Democrat [[Robert Byrd]] when he died in office. Manchin was elected to a full-term [[2012 United States Senate election in West Virginia|in 2012]] with 61% of the vote and reelected with 50% of the vote [[2018 United States Senate election in West Virginia|in 2018]]. He became the state's senior U.S. Senator when fellow Democrat [[Jay Rockefeller]] retired in 2015.\n\nAs a member of Congress, Manchin is known for his [[bipartisanship]], voting or working with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] on issues such as [[abortion]] and gun ownership. He opposed the energy policies of President [[Barack Obama]], voted against [[cloture]] for the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]] (he did not vote on the bill itself), voted to remove federal funding for [[Planned Parenthood]] in 2015, and voted to confirm most of President [[Donald Trump]]'s cabinet and judicial appointees, including Associate Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]]. However, Manchin repeatedly voted against attempts to repeal the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as Obamacare), voted to preserve funding for Planned Parenthood in 2017, and voted against the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|2017 Republican tax plan]]. He has complained about the \"toxic\" lack of bipartisanship in Congress.<ref name=\"primary-challenge\">{{cite web |last1=Foran |first1=Clare |title=West Virginia's Conservative Democrat Gets a Primary Challenger |date=May 9, 2017 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/joe-manchin-bernie-sanders-primary-challenge-west-virginia-senate-2018/525918/ |website=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}</ref> In foreign policy, Manchin has repeatedly called for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and opposed most military intervention in Syria.\n\n==Early life and education==\nManchin was born in 1947 in [[Farmington, West Virginia]], a small coal mining town, the second of five children of Mary O.

The [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) remains divided on this issue: of its five members with [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]], three (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) have recognised the declaration of independence, while the People's Republic of China has expressed concern, urging the continuation of the previous negotiation framework. The [[Russian Federation]] has rejected the declaration and considers it illegal.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/15/russia.kosovo Kosovo breakaway illegal, says Putin], ''The Guardian'', 2008-02-15.</ref> In May 2008, Russia, China, and India released a joint statement calling for new negotiations between [[Belgrade]] and [[Pristina]].<ref name=\"Ekaterinburg2\">[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/15/content_8179173.htm Russia, India, China urge resumption of Kosovo talks], Xinhua, 2008-05-15.</ref>\n\nAlthough EU member states individually decide whether to recognise Kosovo, by consensus the EU has commissioned the [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo]] (EULEX) to ensure peace and continued external oversight. Due to the dispute in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the reconfiguration of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) and partial handover to the EULEX mission met with difficulties. In spite of Russian and Serbian protests, the UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] proceeded with the reconfiguration plan. On 15 July 2008, he stated: \"In the light of the fact that the Security Council is unable to provide guidance, I have instructed my [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Kosovo|Special Representative]] to move forward with the reconfiguration of UNMIK&nbsp;... in order to adapt UNMIK to a changed reality.\" According to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]], the \"United Nations has maintained a position of strict neutrality on the question of Kosovo's status\".<ref>[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N08/412/84/IMG/N0841284.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo], 15 July 2008 (S/2008/458), United Nations, 2008-07-18.</ref> On 26 November 2008, the UNSC gave the green light to the deployment of the EULEX mission in Kosovo.

Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in [[hydraulic hybrid]]s.\n\nThe basic principle with hybrid vehicles is that the different motors work better at different speeds; the electric motor is more efficient at producing torque, or turning power, and the combustion engine is better for maintaining high speed (better than typical electric motor). Switching from one to the other at the proper time while speeding up yields a [[win-win]] in terms of [[Energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]], as such that translates into greater [[fuel efficiency]], for example. \n\n==Vehicle type ==\n[[File:Montreal hybrid bus.PNG|thumb|right|A [[biodiesel]] hybrid bus in Montreal, Canada]]\n\n===Two-wheeled and cycle-type vehicles===\n[[Moped]]s, [[Motorized bicycles|electric bicycles]], and even [[electric kick scooter]]s are a simple form of a hybrid, powered by an [[internal combustion|internal combustion engine]] or [[electric motor]] and the rider's muscles.

It has the range needed in locations where there are wide gaps with no services. The batteries can be plugged into house (mains) electricity for charging, as well being charged while the engine is running.\n\n===Continuously outboard recharged electric vehicle (COREV)===\nSome [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric vehicles (BEVs)]] can be recharged while the user drives. Such a vehicle establishes contact with an electrified rail, plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanism (see [[Conduit current collection]]). The BEV's batteries are recharged by this process\u2014on the highway\u2014and can then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged. For example, some of the battery-electric locomotives used for maintenance trains on the London Underground are capable of this mode of operation.\n\nDeveloping a BEV infrastructure would provide the advantage of virtually unrestricted highway range. Since many destinations are within 100&nbsp;km of a major highway, BEV technology could reduce the need for expensive battery systems. Unfortunately, private use of the existing electrical system is almost universally prohibited. Besides, the technology for such electrical infrastructure is largely outdated and, outside some cities, not widely distributed (see [[Conduit current collection]], [[trams]], [[electric (rail)|electric rail]], [[Tram|trolleys]], [[third rail]]). Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs could perhaps be funded by toll revenue or by dedicated transportation taxes.\n\n===Hybrid fuel (dual mode)===\n[[File:Ford Escape E85 Flex Plug-in Hybrid views and badging WAS 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid]] with a [[flexible fuel]] capability to run on [[E85]] ([[ethanol]]) ]]\nIn addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for [[Ground propulsion|propulsion]], some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy sources or input types (\"[[fuel]]s\") using the same engine to be hybrids, although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms, these are perhaps more correctly described as [[dual mode]] vehicles:\n* Some [[electric trolleybus]]es can switch between an on-board [[diesel engine]] and overhead electrical power depending on conditions (see [[dual mode bus]]). In principle, this could be combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug-in hybrid trolleybus, although {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, no such design seems to have been announced.\n* [[Flexible-fuel vehicle]]s can use a mixture of input fuels mixed in one tank \u2014 typically [[gasoline]] and [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[biobutanol]].\n* [[Bi-fuel vehicle]]: [[Liquified petroleum gas]] and [[natural gas]] are very different from petroleum or diesel and cannot be used in the same tanks, so it would be impossible to build an (LPG or NG) flexible fuel system. Instead vehicles are built with two, parallel, fuel systems feeding one engine. For example, some Chevrolet [http://www.chevrolet.com/culture/article/bi-fuel-silverado-natural-gas.html Silverado 2500 HDs] can effortlessly switch between petroleum and natural gas, offering a range of over 1000&nbsp;km (650&nbsp;miles).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bi-Fuel Silverado 2500HD Can Switch Between Gasoline And Natural Gas|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/culture/article/bi-fuel-silverado-natural-gas.html|accessdate=2013-03-31}}</ref> While the duplicated tanks cost space in some applications, the increased range, decreased cost of fuel, and flexibility where [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] or [[CNG]] infrastructure is incomplete may be a significant incentive to purchase.

Regenerative braking can be used to recover some of the supplied drive energy back into the accumulator.\n\n====Petro-air hybrid====\nA French company, [[Motor Development International|MDI]], has designed and has running models of a petro-air hybrid engine car.

The auto industry recently focused on this hybrid configuration as it now shows promise for introduction into smaller vehicles.\n\nIn petro-hydraulic hybrids, the [[energy recovery]] rate is high and therefore the system is more efficient than electric battery charged hybrids using the current electric battery technology, demonstrating a 60% to 70% increase in [[energy economy]] in US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) testing.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/otaq/technology/420f05006.htm EPA Announces Partnership to Demonstrate World's First Full Hydraulic Hybrid Urban Delivery Vehicle | Modeling, Testing, and Research | US EPA].

The charging engine runs at optimum speed and load for efficiency and longevity. Under tests undertaken by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a hydraulic hybrid [[Ford Expedition]] returned {{convert|32|mpgus}} City, and {{convert|22|mpgus}} highway.<ref name=\"demo-veh\"/><ref name=\"Capturing the power of hydraulics\"/> [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] currently has two trucks in service using this technology.<ref name=\"autoblog.com\"/>\n\nAlthough petro-hydraulic hybrid technology has been known for decades, and used in trains and very large construction vehicles, high costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars. In the modern sense an experiment proved the viability of small petro-hydraulic hybrid road vehicles in 1978. A group of students at Minneapolis, Minnesota's Hennepin Vocational Technical Center, converted a [[VW Beetle|Volkswagen Beetle]] car to run as a petro-hydraulic hybrid using off-the shelf components. A car rated at {{convert|32|mpgus|abbr=on}} was returning {{convert|75|mpgus|abbr=on}} with the 60&nbsp;hp engine replaced by a 16&nbsp;hp engine. The experimental car reached {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Mother Earth News\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, a team of engineers working at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory succeeded in developing a revolutionary type of petro-hydraulic hybrid powertrain that would propel a typical American sedan car. The test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined EPA city/highway driving cycles. Acceleration was 0-60&nbsp;mph in 8 seconds, using a 1.9 liter diesel engine. No lightweight materials were used. The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only $700 to the base cost of the vehicle.<ref name=\"demo-veh\"/>\n\nThe petro-hydraulic hybrid system has faster and more efficient charge/discharge cycling than petro-electric hybrids and is also cheaper to build. The accumulator vessel size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than an electric battery set. Any vehicle space consumed by a larger size of accumulator vessel may be offset by the need for a smaller sized charging engine, in HP and physical size.\n\nResearch is underway in large corporations and small companies. Focus has now switched to smaller vehicles. The system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. A drawback was that the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load. A British company (Artemis Intelligent Power) made a breakthrough introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor/pump, the Digital Displacement\u00ae motor/pump. The pump is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads, giving feasibility to small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artemisip.com/our-technology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017071459/http://www.artemisip.com/our-technology |archivedate=2013-10-17 }}</ref> The company converted a BMW car as a test bed to prove viability. The BMW 530i, gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car. This test was using the standard 3,000&nbsp;cc engine, with a smaller engine the figures would have been more impressive. The design of petro-hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators allows downsizing an engine to average power usage, not peak power usage. Peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator. A smaller more efficient constant speed engine reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisip.com/applications/on-road|title=On-road|accessdate=2015-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525063540/http://www.artemisip.com/applications/on-road|archive-date=2015-05-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCurrent vehicle bodies are designed around the mechanicals of existing engine/transmission setups. It is restrictive and far from ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups. One research project's goal is to create a blank paper design new car, to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle. All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car. One design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car. The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw-back kinetic braking energy. The hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes, mechanical transmissions, drive shafts and U joints, reducing costs and weight. Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|author=mmh.com |url=http://www.mmh.com/article/lift_trucks_15_ways_the_lift_truck_is_evolving/D2/ |title=Lift Trucks: 15 ways the lift truck is evolving - Article from Modern Materials Handling |publisher=Modern Materials Handling |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions.

Most commonly the internal combustion engine, the electric motor and gear box are coupled by automatically controlled clutches. For electric driving the clutch between the internal combustion engine is open while the clutch to the gear box is engaged. While in combustion mode the engine and motor run at the same speed.\n\nThe first mass production parallel hybrid sold outside Japan was the 1st generation [[Honda Insight]].\n\n===Mild parallel hybrid===\nThese types use a generally compact electric motor (usually <20&nbsp;kW) to provide auto-stop/start features and to provide extra power assist<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/automobile-technology/IMA/detail/ |title=Honda IMA technology |accessdate=2009-05-01 |publisher=Honda Motor}}</ref> during the acceleration, and to generate on the deceleration phase (aka [[regenerative braking]]).\n\nOn-road examples include [[Honda Civic Hybrid]], [[Honda Insight]] 2nd generation, [[Honda CR-Z]], [[Honda Accord Hybrid]], Mercedes Benz [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class#S-Class hybrids|S400 BlueHYBRID]], BMW 7 Series hybrids, [[General Motors]] [[BAS Hybrid]]s, [[Suzuki S-Cross]], [[Suzuki Wagon R]] and [[Smart fortwo]] with micro hybrid drive.\n\n===Power-split or series-parallel hybrid===\nIn a power-split hybrid electric drive train there are two motors: a traction electric motor and an internal combustion engine. The power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power split device, which is a simple [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gear]] set. The ratio can be from 100% for the combustion engine to 100% for the traction electric motor, or anything in between. The combustion engine can act as a generator charging the batteries.\n\nModern versions such as the Toyota [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]] have a second electric motor/generator connected to the planetary gear. In cooperation with the traction motor/generator and the power-split device this provides a continuously variable transmission.\n\nOn the open road, the primary power source is the internal combustion engine. When maximum power is required, for example to overtake, the traction electric motor is used to assist. This increases the available power for a short period, giving the effect of having a larger engine than actually installed. In most applications, the combustion engine is switched off when the car is slow or stationary thereby reducing curbside emissions.\n\nPassenger car installations include [[Toyota Prius]], Ford Escape and Fusion, as well as [[Lexus RX]]400h, RX450h, GS450h, LS600h, and CT200h.\n\n===Series hybrid===\n[[File:Chevrolet Volt charging WAS 2011 833.jpg|thumb|[[Chevrolet Volt]], a [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in]] [[series hybrid]], also called an ''extended range electric vehicle'' (''EREV'')]]\nA '''series- or serial-hybrid vehicle''' is driven by an electric motor, functioning as an electric vehicle while the battery pack energy supply is sufficient, with an engine tuned for running as a generator when the battery pack is insufficient. There is typically no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels, and the primary purpose of the range extender is to charge the battery. Series-hybrids have also been referred to as [[Range extender (vehicle)|extended range electric vehicle]], range-extended electric vehicle, or electric vehicle-extended range (EREV/REEV/EVER).\n\nThe [[BMW i3]] with Range Extender is a production series-hybrid. It operates as an electric vehicle until the battery charge is low, and then activates an engine-powered generator to maintain power, and is also available without the range extender. The [[Fisker Karma]] was the first series-hybrid production vehicle.\n\nWhen describing cars, the battery of a series-hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in - but a series-hybrid may also allow for a battery to only act as a buffer (and for regeneration purposes), and for the electric motor's power to be supplied constantly by a supporting engine. Series arrangements have been common in [[diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s and ships. [[Ferdinand Porsche]] effectively invented this arrangement in speed-record-setting racing cars in the early 20th century, such as the [[Lohner-Porsche|Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid]]. Porsche named his arrangement \"System Mixt\" and it was a [[wheel hub motor]] design, where each of the two front wheels was powered by a separate motor. This arrangement was sometimes referred to as an ''electric transmission'', as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission. The vehicle could not move unless the internal combustion engine was running.\n\nIn 1997 Toyota released the first series-hybrid bus sold in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19970822a8.html |title=Toyota debuts power-hybrid bus &#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=1997-08-22 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> [[General Motors|GM]] introduced the [[Chevy Volt]] series plug-in hybrid in 2010, aiming for an [[all-electric range]] of {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Stossel|first=Sage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/general-motors |title=Electro-Shock Therapy \u2013 The Atlantic (July/August 2008) |magazine=The Atlantic |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> though this car also has a mechanical connection between the engine and drivetrain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/shocker-chevy-says-volts-gas-engine-can-power-the-wheels-its|title=Shocker|date=2010-10-11|website=|accessdate=}}</ref> [[Supercapacitors]] combined with a [[lithium ion]] battery bank have been used by [[AFS Trinity]] in a converted Saturn Vue SUV vehicle.

As with pure electric vehicles, the total emissions saving, for example in CO<sub>2</sub> terms, is dependent upon the energy source of the electricity generating company.\n\nFor some users, this type of vehicle may also be financially attractive so long as the electrical energy being used is cheaper than the petrol/diesel that they would have otherwise used. Current tax systems in many European countries use mineral oil taxation as a major income source. This is generally not the case for electricity, which is taxed uniformly for the domestic customer, however that person uses it.

For accidents where a vehicle was slowing or stopping, backing up, entering or leaving a parking space (when the sound difference between HEVs and ICEVs is most pronounced), HEVs were twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than ICEVs.

These savings are primarily achieved by three elements of a typical hybrid design:\n# Relying on both the engine and the electric motors for peak power needs, resulting in a smaller engine size more for average usage rather than peak power usage. A smaller engine can have less internal losses and lower weight.\n# Having significant battery storage capacity to store and reuse recaptured energy, especially in stop-and-go traffic typical of the city [[driving cycle]].\n# Recapturing significant amounts of energy during braking that are normally wasted as heat. This [[regenerative braking]] reduces vehicle speed by converting some of its kinetic energy into electricity, depending upon the power rating of the motor/generator;\nOther techniques that are not necessarily 'hybrid' features, but that are frequently found on hybrid vehicles include:\n# Using [[Atkinson cycle]] engines instead of [[Otto cycle]] engines for improved fuel economy.\n# Shutting down the engine during traffic stops or while coasting or during other idle periods.\n# Improving [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamics]]; (part of the reason that SUVs get such bad fuel economy is the drag on the car. A box shaped car or truck has to exert more force to move through the air causing more stress on the engine making it work harder). Improving the shape and aerodynamics of a car is a good way to help better the fuel economy and also improve [[vehicle handling]] at the same time.\n# Using low [[rolling resistance]] [[tires]] (tires were often made to give a quiet, smooth ride, high grip, etc., but efficiency was a lower priority). Tires cause mechanical [[drag (physics)|drag]], once again making the engine work harder, consuming more fuel. Hybrid cars may use special tires that are more inflated than regular tires and stiffer or by choice of [[tire#Components|carcass]] structure and rubber compound have lower rolling resistance while retaining acceptable grip, and so improving fuel economy whatever the power source.\n# Powering the a/c, power steering, and other auxiliary pumps electrically as and when needed; this reduces mechanical losses when compared with driving them continuously with traditional engine belts.\n\nThese features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops, coasting and idling periods. In addition [[roadway noise|noise emissions]] are reduced, particularly at idling and low operating speeds, in comparison to conventional engine vehicles. For continuous high speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions.\n\n===Hybrid vehicle emissions===\nHybrid vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to 5.5 metric tons of {{CO2}}. The three most popular hybrid vehicles, [[Honda Civic]], [[Honda Insight]] and [[Toyota Prius]], set the standards even higher by producing 4.1, 3.5, and 3.5 tons showing a major improvement in carbon dioxide emissions. Hybrid vehicles can reduce air emissions of smog-forming pollutants by up to 90% and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deq.state.id.us/air/prog_issues/pollutants/vehicles.cfm#low |title=Air Quality: Vehicle Emissions and Air Quality |first=J. |last=Garcia |publisher=Idaho Department of Environmental Quality |year=2008 |access-date=2009-11-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117133254/http://www.deq.state.id.us/air/prog_issues/pollutants/vehicles.cfm#low |archive-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\nMore fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/does-hybrid-car-production-waste-offset-hybrid-benefits.htm|title=Does hybrid car production waste offset hybrid benefits?|date=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental impact of hybrid car battery===\n{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2008|section}}\n\nThough hybrid cars consume less fuel than conventional cars, there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the hybrid car battery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giansoldati|first=Marco|last2=Rotaris|first2=Lucia|last3=Scorrano|first3=Mariangela|last4=Danielis|first4=Romeo|date=March 2020|title=Does electric car knowledge influence car choice?

The same electric motor that powers the drivetrain is used to resist the motion of the drivetrain. This applied resistance from the electric motor causes the wheel to slow down and simultaneously recharge the batteries.\n* '''Dual power.''' Power can come from either the engine, motor or both depending on driving circumstances. Additional power to assist the engine in accelerating or climbing might be provided by the electric motor. Or more commonly, a smaller electric motor provides all of the power for low-speed driving conditions and is augmented by the engine at higher speeds.\n* '''Automatic start/shutoff.''' It automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarts it when the accelerator is pressed down. This automation is much simpler with an electric motor. Also see dual power above.\n\n==Alternative green vehicles==\n{{Main|Green vehicle#Types}}\nOther types of green vehicles include other vehicles that go fully or partly on alternative energy sources than [[fossil fuel]]. Another option is to use alternative fuel composition (i.e. [[biofuel]]s) in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles, making them go partly on renewable energy sources.\n\nOther approaches include [[personal rapid transit]], a [[public transport]]ation concept that offers automated on-demand non-stop transportation, on a network of specially built guideways.\n\n==Peugeot/Citro\u00ebn hybrid vehicle==\nPeugeot and Citro\u00ebn have announced that they too are building a car that uses compressed air as an energy source.

With combined effort from many car companies, the Hybrid industry has sold millions of Hybrids.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Hybrid car companies like Toyota, Honda, Ford and BMW have pulled together to create a movement of Hybrid vehicle sales pushed by Washington lobbyist to lower the world's emissions and become less reliant on our petroleum consumption.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In 2005, sales went beyond 200,000 Hybrids, but in retrospect that only reduced the global use for gasoline consumption by 200,000 gallons per day \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 360 million gallons used per day.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} According to Bradley Berman author of ''Driving Change\u2014One Hybrid at a time'', \"Cold economics shows that in real dollars, except for a brief spike in the 1970s, gas prices have remained remarkably steady and cheap.

Hybrids may be more efficient than many other gasoline motors as far as gasoline consumption is concerned but as far as being green and good for the environment is completely inaccurate.

This \"green myopia\" as Ottman calls it, fails because marketers focus on the greenness of the product and not on the actual effectiveness. Researchers and analysts say people are drawn to the new technology, as well as the convenience of fewer fill ups. Secondly, people find it rewarding to own the better, newer, flashier, and so called greener car. In the beginning of the hybrid movement car companies reached out to the young people, by using top celebrities, astronauts, and popular TV shows to market hybrids. This made the new technology of hybrids a status to obtain for many people and a must to be cool or even the practical choice for the time. With the many benefits and status of owning a hybrid it is easy to think it's the right thing to do, but in fact may not be as green as it appears.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn 2019 the term \"self-charging hybrid\" became popular in advertising, though cars referred to by this name do not offer any different functionality than a standard hybrid vehicle provides.

This is a 40% reduction from the mandatory 2015 target of 130 g/km. The target is an average for each manufacturer's new car fleet; it allows OEMs to build some vehicles that emit less than the average and some that emit more.\n2025 target: The Commission is required to propose a further emissions reduction target by end-2015 to take effect in 2025. This target will be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals.\nSuper credits for low-emission vehicles: The Regulation will give manufacturers additional incentives to produce cars with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 50 g/km or less (which will be electric or plug-in hybrid cars).

Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in [[hydraulic hybrid]]s.\n\nThe basic principle with hybrid vehicles is that the different motors work better at different speeds; the electric motor is more efficient at producing torque, or turning power, and the combustion engine is better for maintaining high speed (better than typical electric motor). Switching from one to the other at the proper time while speeding up yields a [[win-win]] in terms of [[Energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]], as such that translates into greater [[fuel efficiency]], for example. \n\n==Vehicle type==\n[[File:Montreal hybrid bus.PNG|thumb|right|A [[biodiesel]] hybrid bus in Montreal, Canada]]\n\n===Two-wheeled and cycle-type vehicles===\n[[Moped]]s, [[Motorized bicycles|electric bicycles]], and even [[electric kick scooter]]s are a simple form of a hybrid, powered by an [[internal combustion|internal combustion engine]] or [[electric motor]] and the rider's muscles.

It has the range needed in locations where there are wide gaps with no services. The batteries can be plugged into house (mains) electricity for charging, as well being charged while the engine is running.\n\n===Continuously outboard recharged electric vehicle (COREV)===\nSome [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric vehicles (BEVs)]] can be recharged while the user drives. Such a vehicle establishes contact with an electrified rail, plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanism (see [[Conduit current collection]]). The BEV's batteries are recharged by this process\u2014on the highway\u2014and can then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged. For example, some of the battery-electric locomotives used for maintenance trains on the London Underground are capable of this mode of operation.\n\nDeveloping a BEV infrastructure would provide the advantage of virtually unrestricted highway range. Since many destinations are within 100&nbsp;km of a major highway, BEV technology could reduce the need for expensive battery systems. Unfortunately, private use of the existing electrical system is almost universally prohibited. Besides, the technology for such electrical infrastructure is largely outdated and, outside some cities, not widely distributed (see [[Conduit current collection]], [[trams]], [[electric (rail)|electric rail]], [[Tram|trolleys]], [[third rail]]). Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs could perhaps be funded by toll revenue or by dedicated transportation taxes.\n\n===Hybrid fuel (dual mode)===\n[[File:Ford Escape E85 Flex Plug-in Hybrid views and badging WAS 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid]] with a [[flexible fuel]] capability to run on [[E85]] ([[ethanol]]) ]]\nIn addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for [[Ground propulsion|propulsion]], some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy sources or input types (\"[[fuel]]s\") using the same engine to be hybrids, although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms, these are perhaps more correctly described as [[dual mode]] vehicles:\n* Some [[electric trolleybus]]es can switch between an on-board [[diesel engine]] and overhead electrical power depending on conditions (see [[dual mode bus]]). In principle, this could be combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug-in hybrid trolleybus, although {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, no such design seems to have been announced.\n* [[Flexible-fuel vehicle]]s can use a mixture of input fuels mixed in one tank \u2014 typically [[gasoline]] and [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[biobutanol]].\n* [[Bi-fuel vehicle]]: [[Liquified petroleum gas]] and [[natural gas]] are very different from petroleum or diesel and cannot be used in the same tanks, so it would be impossible to build an (LPG or NG) flexible fuel system. Instead vehicles are built with two, parallel, fuel systems feeding one engine. For example, some Chevrolet [http://www.chevrolet.com/culture/article/bi-fuel-silverado-natural-gas.html Silverado 2500 HDs] can effortlessly switch between petroleum and natural gas, offering a range of over 1000&nbsp;km (650&nbsp;miles).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bi-Fuel Silverado 2500HD Can Switch Between Gasoline And Natural Gas|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/culture/article/bi-fuel-silverado-natural-gas.html|accessdate=2013-03-31}}</ref> While the duplicated tanks cost space in some applications, the increased range, decreased cost of fuel, and flexibility where [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] or [[CNG]] infrastructure is incomplete may be a significant incentive to purchase. While the US Natural gas infrastructure is partially incomplete, it is increasing at a fast pace, and already has 2600 [[CNG]] stations in place.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/stations_counts.html|accessdate=2013-03-31}}</ref> With a growing fueling station infrastructure, a large scale adoption of these bi-fuel vehicles could be seen in the near future. Rising gas prices may also push consumers to purchase these vehicles. When gas prices trade around US$4.00, the price of gasoline is US{{convert|28.00|$/MMBtu|$/MWh|lk=on}}, compared to natural gas's {{convert|4.00|$/MMBtu|$/MWh}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Halber |first=Deborah |title=What is the energy of gasoline compared to the same cost of other fuels in BTUs per dollar? |url=http://engineering.mit.edu/live/news/39-what-is-the-energy-of-gasoline-compared-to-the |accessdate=2013-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406211227/http://engineering.mit.edu/live/news/39-what-is-the-energy-of-gasoline-compared-to-the |archivedate=2013-04-06 }}</ref> On a per unit of energy comparative basis, this makes natural gas much cheaper than gasoline. All of these factors are making CNG-Gasoline bi-fuel vehicles very attractive.\n* Some vehicles have been modified to use another fuel source if it is available, such as cars modified to run on [[Autogas|autogas (LPG)]] and diesels modified to run on [[waste vegetable oil]] that has not been processed into biodiesel.\n* Power-assist mechanisms for [[bicycle]]s and other [[Human-powered transport|human-powered vehicles]] are also included (see [[Motorized bicycle]]).\n\n===Fluid power hybrid===\n{{see also|Compressed air car}}\n[[File:2011 Chrysler Town & Country Touring - L -- 04-22-2011.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysler minivan, petro-hydraulic hybrid]]\n[[File:Catvertroquette.jpg|thumb|right|French MDI petro-air hybrid car developed with Tata]]\n\n[[Hydraulic hybrid]] and [[pneumatic hybrid vehicle]]s use an engine or regenerative braking (or both) to charge a pressure accumulator to drive the wheels via [[hydraulic]] (liquid) or [[pneumatic]] (compressed gas) drive units.

Regenerative braking can be used to recover some of the supplied drive energy back into the accumulator.\n\n====Petro-air hybrid====\nA French company, [[Motor Development International|MDI]], has designed and has running models of a petro-air hybrid engine car.

The auto industry recently focused on this hybrid configuration as it now shows promise for introduction into smaller vehicles.\n\nIn petro-hydraulic hybrids, the [[energy recovery]] rate is high and therefore the system is more efficient than electric battery charged hybrids using the current electric battery technology, demonstrating a 60% to 70% increase in [[energy economy]] in US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) testing.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/otaq/technology/420f05006.htm EPA Announces Partnership to Demonstrate World's First Full Hydraulic Hybrid Urban Delivery Vehicle | Modeling, Testing, and Research | US EPA].

The charging engine runs at optimum speed and load for efficiency and longevity. Under tests undertaken by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a hydraulic hybrid [[Ford Expedition]] returned {{convert|32|mpgus}} City, and {{convert|22|mpgus}} highway.<ref name=\"demo-veh\"/><ref name=\"Capturing the power of hydraulics\"/> [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] currently has two trucks in service using this technology.<ref name=\"autoblog.com\"/>\n\nAlthough petro-hydraulic hybrid technology has been known for decades, and used in trains and very large construction vehicles, high costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars. In the modern sense an experiment proved the viability of small petro-hydraulic hybrid road vehicles in 1978. A group of students at Minneapolis, Minnesota's Hennepin Vocational Technical Center, converted a [[VW Beetle|Volkswagen Beetle]] car to run as a petro-hydraulic hybrid using off-the shelf components. A car rated at {{convert|32|mpgus|abbr=on}} was returning {{convert|75|mpgus|abbr=on}} with the 60&nbsp;hp engine replaced by a 16&nbsp;hp engine. The experimental car reached {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Mother Earth News\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, a team of engineers working at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory succeeded in developing a revolutionary type of petro-hydraulic hybrid powertrain that would propel a typical American sedan car. The test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined EPA city/highway driving cycles. Acceleration was 0-60&nbsp;mph in 8 seconds, using a 1.9 liter diesel engine. No lightweight materials were used. The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only $700 to the base cost of the vehicle.<ref name=\"demo-veh\"/>\n\nThe petro-hydraulic hybrid system has faster and more efficient charge/discharge cycling than petro-electric hybrids and is also cheaper to build. The accumulator vessel size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than an electric battery set. Any vehicle space consumed by a larger size of accumulator vessel may be offset by the need for a smaller sized charging engine, in HP and physical size.\n\nResearch is underway in large corporations and small companies. Focus has now switched to smaller vehicles. The system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. A drawback was that the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load. A British company (Artemis Intelligent Power) made a breakthrough introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor/pump, the Digital Displacement\u00ae motor/pump. The pump is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads, giving feasibility to small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artemisip.com/our-technology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017071459/http://www.artemisip.com/our-technology |archivedate=2013-10-17 }}</ref> The company converted a BMW car as a test bed to prove viability. The BMW 530i, gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car. This test was using the standard 3,000&nbsp;cc engine, with a smaller engine the figures would have been more impressive. The design of petro-hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators allows downsizing an engine to average power usage, not peak power usage. Peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator. A smaller more efficient constant speed engine reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisip.com/applications/on-road|title=On-road|accessdate=2015-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525063540/http://www.artemisip.com/applications/on-road|archive-date=2015-05-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCurrent vehicle bodies are designed around the mechanicals of existing engine/transmission setups. It is restrictive and far from ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups. One research project's goal is to create a blank paper design new car, to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle. All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car. One design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car. The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw-back kinetic braking energy. The hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes, mechanical transmissions, drive shafts and U joints, reducing costs and weight. Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|author=mmh.com |url=http://www.mmh.com/article/lift_trucks_15_ways_the_lift_truck_is_evolving/D2/ |title=Lift Trucks: 15 ways the lift truck is evolving - Article from Modern Materials Handling |publisher=Modern Materials Handling |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions.

Most commonly the internal combustion engine, the electric motor and gear box are coupled by automatically controlled clutches. For electric driving the clutch between the internal combustion engine is open while the clutch to the gear box is engaged. While in combustion mode the engine and motor run at the same speed.\n\nThe first mass production parallel hybrid sold outside Japan was the 1st generation [[Honda Insight]].\n\n===Mild parallel hybrid===\nThese types use a generally compact electric motor (usually <20&nbsp;kW) to provide auto-stop/start features and to provide extra power assist<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/automobile-technology/IMA/detail/ |title=Honda IMA technology |accessdate=2009-05-01 |publisher=Honda Motor}}</ref> during the acceleration, and to generate on the deceleration phase (aka [[regenerative braking]]).\n\nOn-road examples include [[Honda Civic Hybrid]], [[Honda Insight]] 2nd generation, [[Honda CR-Z]], [[Honda Accord Hybrid]], Mercedes Benz [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class#S-Class hybrids|S400 BlueHYBRID]], BMW 7 Series hybrids, [[General Motors]] [[BAS Hybrid]]s, [[Suzuki S-Cross]], [[Suzuki Wagon R]] and [[Smart fortwo]] with micro hybrid drive.\n\n===Power-split or series-parallel hybrid===\nIn a power-split hybrid electric drive train there are two motors: a traction electric motor and an internal combustion engine. The power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power split device, which is a simple [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gear]] set. The ratio can be from 100% for the combustion engine to 100% for the traction electric motor, or anything in between. The combustion engine can act as a generator charging the batteries.\n\nModern versions such as the Toyota [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]] have a second electric motor/generator connected to the planetary gear. In cooperation with the traction motor/generator and the power-split device this provides a continuously variable transmission.\n\nOn the open road, the primary power source is the internal combustion engine. When maximum power is required, for example to overtake, the traction electric motor is used to assist. This increases the available power for a short period, giving the effect of having a larger engine than actually installed. In most applications, the combustion engine is switched off when the car is slow or stationary thereby reducing curbside emissions.\n\nPassenger car installations include [[Toyota Prius]], Ford Escape and Fusion, as well as [[Lexus RX]]400h, RX450h, GS450h, LS600h, and CT200h.\n\n===Series hybrid===\n[[File:Chevrolet Volt charging WAS 2011 833.jpg|thumb|[[Chevrolet Volt]], a [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in]] [[series hybrid]], also called an ''extended range electric vehicle'' (''EREV'')]]\nA '''series- or serial-hybrid vehicle''' is driven by an electric motor, functioning as an electric vehicle while the battery pack energy supply is sufficient, with an engine tuned for running as a generator when the battery pack is insufficient. There is typically no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels, and the primary purpose of the range extender is to charge the battery. Series-hybrids have also been referred to as [[Range extender (vehicle)|extended range electric vehicle]], range-extended electric vehicle, or electric vehicle-extended range (EREV/REEV/EVER).\n\nThe [[BMW i3]] with Range Extender is a production series-hybrid. It operates as an electric vehicle until the battery charge is low, and then activates an engine-powered generator to maintain power, and is also available without the range extender. The [[Fisker Karma]] was the first series-hybrid production vehicle.\n\nWhen describing cars, the battery of a series-hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in - but a series-hybrid may also allow for a battery to only act as a buffer (and for regeneration purposes), and for the electric motor's power to be supplied constantly by a supporting engine. Series arrangements have been common in [[diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s and ships. [[Ferdinand Porsche]] effectively invented this arrangement in speed-record-setting racing cars in the early 20th century, such as the [[Lohner-Porsche|Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid]]. Porsche named his arrangement \"System Mixt\" and it was a [[wheel hub motor]] design, where each of the two front wheels was powered by a separate motor. This arrangement was sometimes referred to as an ''electric transmission'', as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission. The vehicle could not move unless the internal combustion engine was running.\n\nIn 1997 Toyota released the first series-hybrid bus sold in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19970822a8.html |title=Toyota debuts power-hybrid bus &#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=1997-08-22 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> [[General Motors|GM]] introduced the [[Chevy Volt]] series plug-in hybrid in 2010, aiming for an [[all-electric range]] of {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Stossel|first=Sage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/general-motors |title=Electro-Shock Therapy \u2013 The Atlantic (July/August 2008) |magazine=The Atlantic |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> though this car also has a mechanical connection between the engine and drivetrain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/shocker-chevy-says-volts-gas-engine-can-power-the-wheels-its|title=Shocker|date=2010-10-11|website=|accessdate=}}</ref> [[Supercapacitors]] combined with a [[lithium ion]] battery bank have been used by [[AFS Trinity]] in a converted Saturn Vue SUV vehicle.

As with pure electric vehicles, the total emissions saving, for example in CO<sub>2</sub> terms, is dependent upon the energy source of the electricity generating company.\n\nFor some users, this type of vehicle may also be financially attractive so long as the electrical energy being used is cheaper than the petrol/diesel that they would have otherwise used. Current tax systems in many European countries use mineral oil taxation as a major income source. This is generally not the case for electricity, which is taxed uniformly for the domestic customer, however that person uses it. Some electricity suppliers also offer price benefits for off-peak night users, which may further increase the attractiveness of the plug-in option for commuters and urban motorists.\n\n===Road safety for cyclists, pedestrians===\n[[File:2017 Nissan LEAF (ZE0 MY17) hatchback (2018-11-02) 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first [[plug-in electric car]] equipped with [[Nissan]]'s Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians.]]{{Main|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}\nA 2009 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report examined [[hybrid electric vehicle]] accidents that involved pedestrians and cyclists and compared them to accidents involving [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles (ICEV).

For accidents where a vehicle was slowing or stopping, backing up, entering or leaving a parking space (when the sound difference between HEVs and ICEVs is most pronounced), HEVs were twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than ICEVs.

These savings are primarily achieved by three elements of a typical hybrid design:\n# Relying on both the engine and the electric motors for peak power needs, resulting in a smaller engine size more for average usage rather than peak power usage. A smaller engine can have less internal losses and lower weight.\n# Having significant battery storage capacity to store and reuse recaptured energy, especially in stop-and-go traffic typical of the city [[driving cycle]].\n# Recapturing significant amounts of energy during braking that are normally wasted as heat. This [[regenerative braking]] reduces vehicle speed by converting some of its kinetic energy into electricity, depending upon the power rating of the motor/generator;\nOther techniques that are not necessarily 'hybrid' features, but that are frequently found on hybrid vehicles include:\n# Using [[Atkinson cycle]] engines instead of [[Otto cycle]] engines for improved fuel economy.\n# Shutting down the engine during traffic stops or while coasting or during other idle periods.\n# Improving [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamics]]; (part of the reason that SUVs get such bad fuel economy is the drag on the car. A box shaped car or truck has to exert more force to move through the air causing more stress on the engine making it work harder). Improving the shape and aerodynamics of a car is a good way to help better the fuel economy and also improve [[vehicle handling]] at the same time.\n# Using low [[rolling resistance]] [[tires]] (tires were often made to give a quiet, smooth ride, high grip, etc., but efficiency was a lower priority). Tires cause mechanical [[drag (physics)|drag]], once again making the engine work harder, consuming more fuel. Hybrid cars may use special tires that are more inflated than regular tires and stiffer or by choice of [[tire#Components|carcass]] structure and rubber compound have lower rolling resistance while retaining acceptable grip, and so improving fuel economy whatever the power source.\n# Powering the a/c, power steering, and other auxiliary pumps electrically as and when needed; this reduces mechanical losses when compared with driving them continuously with traditional engine belts.\n\nThese features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops, coasting and idling periods. In addition [[roadway noise|noise emissions]] are reduced, particularly at idling and low operating speeds, in comparison to conventional engine vehicles. For continuous high speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions.\n\n===Hybrid vehicle emissions===\nHybrid vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to 5.5 metric tons of {{CO2}}. The three most popular hybrid vehicles, [[Honda Civic]], [[Honda Insight]] and [[Toyota Prius]], set the standards even higher by producing 4.1, 3.5, and 3.5 tons showing a major improvement in carbon dioxide emissions. Hybrid vehicles can reduce air emissions of smog-forming pollutants by up to 90% and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deq.state.id.us/air/prog_issues/pollutants/vehicles.cfm#low |title=Air Quality: Vehicle Emissions and Air Quality |first=J. |last=Garcia |publisher=Idaho Department of Environmental Quality |year=2008 |access-date=2009-11-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117133254/http://www.deq.state.id.us/air/prog_issues/pollutants/vehicles.cfm#low |archive-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\nMore fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/does-hybrid-car-production-waste-offset-hybrid-benefits.htm|title=Does hybrid car production waste offset hybrid benefits?|date=2010-12-06}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental impact of hybrid car battery===\n{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2008|section}}\n\nThough hybrid cars consume less fuel than conventional cars, there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the hybrid car battery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giansoldati|first=Marco|last2=Rotaris|first2=Lucia|last3=Scorrano|first3=Mariangela|last4=Danielis|first4=Romeo|date=March 2020|title=Does electric car knowledge influence car choice?

The same electric motor that powers the drivetrain is used to resist the motion of the drivetrain. This applied resistance from the electric motor causes the wheel to slow down and simultaneously recharge the batteries.\n* '''Dual power.''' Power can come from either the engine, motor or both depending on driving circumstances. Additional power to assist the engine in accelerating or climbing might be provided by the electric motor. Or more commonly, a smaller electric motor provides all of the power for low-speed driving conditions and is augmented by the engine at higher speeds.\n* '''Automatic start/shutoff.''' It automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarts it when the accelerator is pressed down. This automation is much simpler with an electric motor. Also see dual power above.\n\n==Alternative green vehicles==\n{{Main|Green vehicle#Types}}\nOther types of green vehicles include other vehicles that go fully or partly on alternative energy sources than [[fossil fuel]].

This \"green myopia\" as Ottman calls it, fails because marketers focus on the greenness of the product and not on the actual effectiveness. Researchers and analysts say people are drawn to the new technology, as well as the convenience of fewer fill ups. Secondly, people find it rewarding to own the better, newer, flashier, and so called greener car. In the beginning of the hybrid movement car companies reached out to the young people, by using top celebrities, astronauts, and popular TV shows to market hybrids. This made the new technology of hybrids a status to obtain for many people and a must to be cool or even the practical choice for the time. With the many benefits and status of owning a hybrid it is easy to think it's the right thing to do, but in fact may not be as green as it appears.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn 2019 the term \"self-charging hybrid\" became popular in advertising, though cars referred to by this name do not offer any different functionality than a standard hybrid vehicle provides.

These analogs collectively suggest it would take at least 30 years for hybrid and electric vehicles to capture 80% of the US passenger vehicle stock.\n<ref>{{cite book| first=Saurin D. |last=Shah |chapter=2 Electrification of Transport and Oil Displacement |title=Plug-In Electrical Vehicles: What Role for Washington |editor-first=David |editor-last=Sandalow |publisher=Brookings Institution |year=2009 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9XEgUchZzgC&lpg=PA22&ots=uTQUg766ET&dq=saurin%20shah%20and%20oil%20displacement&pg=PA22#v=onepage |isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |accessdate=2011-08-11 }}</ref>\n\n==European Union 2020 regulation standards==\nThe European Parliament, Council and European Commission has reached an agreement which is aimed at reducing the average CO<sub>2</sub> passenger car emissions to 95 g/km by 2020, according to a European Commission press release.\n\nAccording to the release, the key details of the agreement are as follows:\n\nEmissions target: The agreement will reduce average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from new cars to 95 g/km from 2020, as proposed by the Commission. This is a 40% reduction from the mandatory 2015 target of 130 g/km. The target is an average for each manufacturer's new car fleet; it allows OEMs to build some vehicles that emit less than the average and some that emit more.\n2025 target: The Commission is required to propose a further emissions reduction target by end-2015 to take effect in 2025. This target will be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals.\nSuper credits for low-emission vehicles: The Regulation will give manufacturers additional incentives to produce cars with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 50 g/km or less (which will be electric or plug-in hybrid cars). Each of these vehicles will be counted as two vehicles in 2020, 1.67 in 2021, 1.33 in 2022 and then as one vehicle from 2023 onwards. These super credits will help manufacturers further reduce the average emissions of their new car fleet. However, to prevent the scheme from undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation, there will be a 2.5 g/km cap per manufacturer on the contribution that super credits can make to their target in any year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ihs.com/products/global-insight/industry-economic-report.aspx?id=1065980565 |title=EU agrees deal on 2020 car emissions regulations |access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Ecology}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternative propulsion]]\n* [[Bivalent (engine)]]\n* [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel-electric]]\n* [[Efficient energy use]]\n* [[Electric vehicle]]\n* [[Global Hybrid Cooperation]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Human-electric hybrid vehicle]]\n* [[Hybrid electric vehicle]]\n* [[Hybrid locomotive]]\n* [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain]]\n* [[List of hybrid vehicles]]\n* [[Multifuel stove]]\n* [[Plug-in hybrid]]\n* [[PNGV]]\n* [[Solid oxide fuel cell]]\n* [[Triple-hybrid]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hybrid-powered vehicles}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720205230/http://www.ama.ab.ca/westworld/?%2Farticles%2Fhail_a_hybrid Hybrid Taxi Pilot Program]\n* [http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/01/scuderi-20100116.html Scuderi Group to Present Preliminary Results on Air-Hybrid Study and Update on Scuderi Engine Prototype Testing at Washington Auto Show]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113537/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/131/1/ The Future of Flight (Obese Pelicans to Shape-Shifting Switchblades)]\n\n{{Alternative propulsion}}\n{{Automobile configuration}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hybrid vehicles| ]]\n[[Category:Engines]]\n[[Category:Electric vehicles]]\n[[Category:Hybrid electric buses]]\n", "name_user": "Sheharyarakhtar786", "label": "safe", "comment": "The electric motor provides all the physical mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels.
