Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

They were badly routed at the [[Battle of Middleburg]], a blemish on an otherwise competent combat record.\n\n==History==\nThe regiment was organized between December 1861 and March 1862 at [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] as the '''1st New England Cavalry'''. Late in that month, the regiment was sent to [[Washington D.C.]] and initially assigned to Hatch's cavalry brigade in [[Nathaniel Banks]]' [[V Corps (ACW)|V Corps]] in the Department of the Shenandoah. Throughout the war, the regiment would be a part of many reorganizations of the cavalry, although the majority of its service was with the [[Army of the Potomac]].\n\nMost of the regiment's service in 1862 was in northern [[Virginia]], where it served as scouts to determine enemy movements, as well as foraging for supplies and screening infantry movements. The troopers saw action contesting [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s cavalry in the Valley Campaign. They fought in the [[Second Battle of Manassas|Second Bull Run Campaign]], as well as many other battles of note, including service in the cavalry actions surrounding the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. \n\nIn 1863, they participated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville Campaign]], and played an important role in the opening battle of the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] at [[Battle of Brandy Station|Brandy Station]]. Shortly thereafter, isolated and alone deep in Confederate territory on a scouting mission, they lost nearly 240 of their 280 remaining men at the June 17 skirmish at Middleburg. The regiment was refitted with new recruits and performed scouting and outpost duty along the upper [[Potomac River]] until September, when they rejoined the Army of the Potomac, participating in the [[Bristoe Campaign]] and [[Mine Run Campaign]]. \n\nThe following year, the 1st Rhode Island served in the defenses of Washington D.C. before eventually returning to the Shenandoah Valley under the command of [[Philip H. Sheridan]]. Due to heavy battle losses, the regiment was consolidated to a [[battalion]] of four companies on January 1, 1865. They continued serving in the valley for much of the rest of the war before being mustered out at [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on August 3, 1865.\n\nDuring the war, the regiment lost 1 officer and 16 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 2 officers and 77 enlisted men to disease. Hundreds more were wounded or captured. A total of 2,124 different men served in the regiment at various times, although its field strength normally was less than 500 effectives.\n\n==Notable members==\n* Captain [[George N.

{"title_page": "Michel de Castelnau", "text_new": "[[File:Steven van Herwijck medal of Michel de Castelnau.jpg|thumb|Portrait [[medal]] of Michel de Castelnau, Sieur de la Mauvissi\u00e8re, by [[Steven van Herwijck]], 1565.]]\n'''Michel de Castelnau, Sieur de la Mauvissi\u00e8re''' (c. 1520\u20131592), French soldier and diplomat, ambassador to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].  His memoirs, covering the period between 1559 and 1570, are considered a more reliable source for the period than many others.\n\n==Life==\nHe was born in La Mauvissi\u00e8re (now part of [[Neuvy-le-Roi]], [[Indre-et-Loire]]), [[Touraine]] about 1520. He was one of a large family of children, and his grandfather, Pierre de Castelnau, was [[Master of the Horse|Equerry]] (Master of the Horse) to [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nEndowed with a clear and penetrating intellect and remarkable strength of memory, he received a careful education, capped off with travels in Italy and a long stay at Rome. He then spent some time in [[Malta]] and afterwards entered the army. His first acquaintance with war was in the campaigns of the French in Italy. His abilities and his courage won him the friendship and protection of the [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine]], who took him into his service. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1557 a command in the [[navy]] was given to him, and the cardinal proposed to get him knighted. This, however, he declined, and then rejoined the French army in [[Picardy]]. Various delicate missions requiring tact and discretion were entrusted to him by the [[Grand Constable of France|Constable]], [[Anne de Montmorency]], and these he discharged so satisfactorily that he was sent by the king, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], to [[Scotland]] with dispatches for [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was betrothed to the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (afterwards [[Francis II of France|Francis II]]). {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFrom Scotland he passed into England in 1559, and treated with Queen Elizabeth respecting her claims on [[Calais]], a settlement of which was effected at the congress of [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]]. He was next sent as ambassador to the princes of Germany, for the purpose of prevailing upon them to withdraw their favor from the [[Protestant]]s. This embassy was followed by missions to [[Margaret of Austria (1522-1583)|Margaret of Austria]], governess of the Netherlands, to [[Savoy]], and then to Rome, to ascertain the views of [[Pope Paul IV]] in regard to France. Paul having died just before his arrival, Castelnau used his influence in favor of the election of [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]]. Returning to France, he once more entered the navy, and served under his former patron. It was his good fortune, at [[Nantes]], to discover the earliest symptoms of the [[Conspiracy of Amboise]], which he immediately reported to the government.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAfter the death of Francis II in December 1560, he accompanied the queen, Mary Stuart, to Scotland, and remained with her a year, during which time he made several journeys into England in an attempt to bring about a reconciliation between Mary and Queen Elizabeth. The wise and moderate counsel that he offered to the former were unheeded. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1562, as a consequence of the civil war in France, he returned there. He was employed against the Protestants in [[Brittany]], was taken prisoner in an engagement with them and sent to [[Le Havre|Havre]], but was soon after exchanged. In the midst of the excited passions of his countrymen, Castelnau, who was a sincere [[Roman Catholic]], maintained a wise self-control and moderation, and by his counsels rendered valuable service to the government. He served at the [[siege of Rouen]], distinguished himself at the [[battle of Dreux]], took [[Tancarville]], and contributed in 1563 to the recapture of Havre from the English.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nDuring the next ten years Castelnau was employed in various important missions: first to Queen Elizabeth to negotiate a peace; next to the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], the new governor of the Netherlands. On this occasion he discovered the project formed by the [[Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince of Cond\u00e9]] and [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] to seize and carry off the royal family at [[Monceaux]] (1567). After the [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1567)|battle of St. Denis]] he was again sent to Germany to solicit aid against the Protestants; and on his return he was rewarded for his services with the post of governor of [[Saint-Dizier]] and a company of orderlies. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAt the head of his company he took part in the battles of [[Battle of Jarnac|Jarnac]] and [[Battle of Moncontour|Moncontour]]. In 1572 he was sent to England by [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] to allay the excitement created by the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], and the same year he was sent to Germany and Switzerland. Two years later he was reappointed by [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] ambassador to Queen Elizabeth, and he remained at her court for ten years. During this period he used his influence to promote the marriage of the queen with the [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Alen\u00e7on]], with a view especially to strengthen and maintain the alliance of the two countries. But Elizabeth made so many promises only to break them that at last he refused to accept them or communicate them to his government.\n\nOn his return to France he found that his ch\u00e2teau of La Mauvissi\u00e8re had been destroyed in the civil war; and as he refused to recognize the authority of the League, the [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] deprived him of the governorship of Saint-Dizier. He was thus brought almost to a state of destitution. But on the accession of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the king, who knew his worth, and was confident that although he was a Catholic he might rely on his fidelity, gave him a command in the army, and entrusted him with various confidential missions.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nCastelnau died at [[Joinville, Haute-Marne|Joinville]] in 1592. His ''M\u00e9moires'' rank very high among the original authorities for the period they cover, the eleven years between 1559 and 1570. They were written during his last embassy in England for the benefit of his son; and they possess the merits of clearness, veracity and impartiality. They were first printed in 1621; again, with additions by Le Laboreur, in 2 vols. folio, in 1659; and a third time, still further enlarged by Jean Godefroy, 3 vols. folio, in 1731. Castelnau translated into [[French language|French]] the [[Latin]] work of [[Petrus Ramus|Ramus]], ''On the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Gauls''. Various letters of his are preserved in the Cottonian and Harleian collections in the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis grandson, [[Jacques de Castelnau]] (1620\u20131658), distinguished himself in the war against Austria and Spain during the ministries of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], and died a [[Marshal of France]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Castelnau, Michel de|volume=5 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=onNZAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s Laboureur, Jean de, ed., ''Les memoires de Messire Michel de Castelnau, seigneur de Mauvissiere'', vol.1 (1731)]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAFAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s Petitot, ed., ''M\u00e9moires de messire Michel de Castelnau: seigneur de Mauvissi\u00e8re at de Concressaut, baron de Jonville, comte de Beaumont, Le Roger etc.'', vol.33, ''Collection de M\u00e9moires'', Paris (1823)]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Castelnau, Michel de}}\n[[Category:1520s births]]\n[[Category:1592 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Indre-et-Loire]]\n[[Category:French military personnel]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of France to Scotland]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of France to England]]\n[[Category:Court of Mary, Queen of Scots]]\n[[Category:16th-century French diplomats]]\n[[Category:16th-century French people]]\n[[Category:French memoirists]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Steven van Herwijck medal of Michel de Castelnau.jpg|thumb|Portrait [[medal]] of Michel de Castelnau, Sieur de la Mauvissi\u00e8re, by [[Steven van Herwijck]], 1565.]]\n'''Michel de Castelnau, Sieur de la Mauvissi\u00e8re''' (c. 1520\u20131592), French soldier and diplomat, ambassador to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].
