It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/03/08/national/railway-to-pay-for-1995-fatality/ |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 8, 2001 |title= Railway to pay for 1995 fatality; Shinkansen victim's parents win 49 million yen in damages  }}</ref> There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153|title=Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Trains) and Maglev Magnetic Trains |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122174638/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.<ref name=BBC33322794>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33322794 |title=Japan bullet train passenger starts fire injuring eight |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

Use of the GCT was estimated to result in a time saving of 28.5% (32 minutes) on the current timetable. The proposed time saving if a 'relay' service is introduced is unknown at this time.\n\nAs part of this proposal, the current 12.8&nbsp;km section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen is proposed to be duplicated.

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013. The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at [[Shin-Yatsushiro Station]] (on [[Kyushu]]), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating 33,000&nbsp;km, following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies.<ref name=\"mynavi20141224\">{{cite web |url= http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2014/12/24/335/ |script-title=ja:\u4e5d\u5dde\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u6b20\u640d\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u8010\u4e45\u8d70\u884c\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u4f11\u6b62 |trans-title= Kyushu Shinkansen Free Gauge Train endurance testing suspended following discovery of defects |date= 24 December 2014|work= Mynavi News|publisher= Mynavi Corporation |location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 27 December 2014}}</ref> The train was being trialled between [[Kumamoto]], travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer has been installed, so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to [[Kagoshima]].

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot. [[JR Central]] called the plan \"unrealistic\" due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Maehara sounds out JR Tokai over shinkansen link for Haneda airport|newspaper= Japan Today|date= 28 December 2009|url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/maehara-sounds-out-jr-tokai-over-shinkansen-link-for-haneda-airport|accessdate= 28 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chuo Shinkansen (sometimes referred to as a bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit beyond that.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Line\n!colspan=2|Speed\n!colspan=2|Length\n!rowspan=2|Construction began/proposed\n!rowspan=2|Expected start of revenue services\n|-\n!km/h\n!mph\n!km\n!mi\n|-\n| [[Kyushu Shinkansen]] (West Kyushu Route)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|66.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2009 \n|FY2022\n|-\n| [[Hokuriku Shinkansen]] Phase 3 (Kanazawa \u2013 Tsuruga)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|120.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2012 \n|FY2022\n|-\n| [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] Phase 2 (Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto \u2013 Sapporo)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|211.3|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|2012 \n|FY2030\n|-\n| Hokuriku Shinkansen Phase 4 (Tsuruga \u2013 Obama \u2013 Kyoto \u2013 Shin-Osaka)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}} \n|2030 \n|FY2045\n|}\n\n== List of train types ==\nTrains are up to sixteen cars long.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started.

Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/03/08/national/railway-to-pay-for-1995-fatality/ |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 8, 2001 |title= Railway to pay for 1995 fatality; Shinkansen victim's parents win 49 million yen in damages  }}</ref> There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153|title=Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Trains) and Maglev Magnetic Trains |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122174638/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.<ref name=BBC33322794>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33322794 |title=Japan bullet train passenger starts fire injuring eight |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013.

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started. Shinkansen runs between these cities in about two hours or less.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Osaka (515&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is dominant because of fast (2 hours 22 minutes) and frequent service (up to every 10 minutes by ''Nozomi''); however, air travel has a certain share (~20\u201330%).\n* Tokyo \u2013 Okayama (676&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Hiroshima (821&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is reported to have increased its market share from ~40% to ~60% over the last decade.<ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\">{{cite web |url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |title=Japanese airlines facing threat from below- Nikkei Asian Review |publisher=Asia.nikkei.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301141326/http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Shinkansen takes about three to four hours and there are ''Nozomi'' trains every 30 minutes, but airlines may provide cheaper fares, attracting price-conscious passengers.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Fukuoka (1,069&nbsp;km): The Shinkansen takes about five hours on the fastest ''Nozomi'', and discount carriers have made air travel far cheaper, so most people choose air. Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

The alien claims to be [[Kukulkan]], god of the ancient [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and [[Aztec]] peoples of Earth. He says that he is actually a very long-lived, benevolent entity who wants the humans to worship him, as the Mayas and Aztecs did. Upon resistance by the crew, he proclaims them \"thankless\".\n\nKukulkan transports [[Captain Kirk]], Chief Medical Officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]], Chief Engineer [[Montgomery Scott|Scott]] and Ensign Walking Bear to his ship. By using technology similar to a [[holodeck]], Kukulkan makes them believe they are standing in the middle of an ancient city. Kukulkan warns them that he will only appear before them once they've solved the riddle of the city.\n\nThe city combines the architectures of many ancient Earth cultures: Egyptian, Aztec, Chinese, etc. Kirk concludes that Kukulkan had visited many of the peoples on Earth, but each only took a portion of what he taught them. So none of them ever fulfilled the complete instructions to signal his return.\n\nBy chance, Kirk scales a huge pyramid in the center of the city. There, he concludes that the sun will activate Kukulkan's signalling device. He orders Bones and Scotty to turn huge serpent-headed statues toward the pyramid. In doing so, the now focused sunlight ignites the signalling device. Kukulkan responds, \"Behold, my design is complete. See me now with your own eyes!\"\n\nKukulkan does appear and turns out to be an alien winged serpent.\n\nThe city disappears, only to make the group realize that they were never really there. They now realize that the collection of animals they see before them in small glass \"cages\" was exactly how they experienced the city. The animals are unaware of being on Kukulkan's ship, much as the group thought they were actually in an ancient city.\n\nKukulkan demands that the humans worship him, just as the ancients on Earth did. He grows angry when Kirk explains that mankind has \"grown up\" and no longer needs to worship him.\n\nIn the meantime, Science Officer [[Spock]] has figured out a way to release the ''Enterprise'' from Kukulkan's beam and breaks free. This, too, angers Kukulkan who exclaims that he will \"smash\" the ''Enterprise''. To buy Spock some time, Kirk and Bones decide to break loose a Capellan Power Cat from one of Kukulkan's glass cages. The distraction works, as the ''Enterprise'' is able to use its phasers to disable Kukulkan's ship.\n\nWith the Power Cat threatening Kukulkan, Kirk leaps at the animal and is able to sedate it with a hypo. Kirk again attempts to reason with Kukulkan, conceding that while the alien did help humanity when it needed it, they no longer need his guidance. The alien reluctantly agrees, and departs.\n\n==Production==\n[[Russel Bates]] knew the series' story editor, [[D. C. Fontana]], through ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' producer [[Gene L.

The alien claims to be [[Kukulkan]], god of the ancient [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and [[Aztec]] peoples of Earth. He says that he is actually a very long-lived, benevolent entity who wants the humans to worship him, as the Mayas and Aztecs did. Upon resistance by the crew, he proclaims them \"thankless\".\n\nKukulkan transports [[Captain Kirk]], Chief Medical Officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]], Chief Engineer [[Montgomery Scott|Scott]] and Ensign Walking Bear to his ship. By using technology similar to a [[holodeck]], Kukulkan makes them believe they are standing in the middle of an ancient city. Kukulkan warns them that he will only appear before them once they've solved the riddle of the city.\n\nThe city combines the architectures of many ancient Earth cultures: Egyptian, Aztec, Chinese, etc. Kirk concludes that Kukulkan had visited many of the peoples on Earth, but each only took a portion of what he taught them. So none of them ever fulfilled the complete instructions to signal his return.\n\nBy chance, Kirk scales a huge pyramid in the center of the city. There, he concludes that the sun will activate Kukulkan's signalling device. He orders Bones and Scotty to turn huge serpent-headed statues toward the pyramid. In doing so, the now focused sunlight ignites the signalling device. Kukulkan responds, \"Behold, my design is complete. See me now with your own eyes!\"\n\nKukulkan does appear and turns out to be an alien winged serpent.\n\nThe city disappears, only to make the group realize that they were never really there. They now realize that the collection of animals they see before them in small glass \"cages\" was exactly how they experienced the city. The animals are unaware of being on Kukulkan's ship, much as the group thought they were actually in an ancient city.\n\nKukulkan demands that the humans worship him, just as the ancients on Earth did. He grows angry when Kirk explains that mankind has \"grown up\" and no longer needs to worship him.\n\nIn the meantime, Science Officer [[Spock]] has figured out a way to free the ''Enterprise'' from Kukulkan's beam and breaks free. This, too, angers Kukulkan who exclaims that he will \"smash\" the ''Enterprise''. To buy Spock some time, Kirk and Bones decide to break loose a Capellan Power Cat from one of Kukulkan's glass cages. The distraction works, as the ''Enterprise'' is able to use its phasers to disable Kukulkan's ship.\n\nWith the Power Cat threatening Kukulkan, Kirk leaps at the animal and is able to sedate it with a hypo. Kirk again attempts to reason with Kukulkan, conceding that while the alien did help humanity when it needed it, they no longer need his guidance. The alien reluctantly agrees, and departs.\n\n==Production==\n[[Russel Bates]] knew the series' story editor, [[D. C. Fontana]], through ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' producer [[Gene L.

{"title_page": "Abelard Snazz", "text_new": "[[Image:Abelard snazz.png|right|thumb|200px|Abelard Snazz.]]\n'''Abelard Snazz''' was a fictional comics character, created by  [[Alan Moore]], and first illustrated by artist [[Steve Dillon]]. A super intelligent man, nicknamed  \"The Man With The Multi-Storey Mind\", he appeared on the pages of British magazine ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nAbelard Snazz, also known as \"the man with the two/multi-story brain\", is a genius whose plans nevertheless do not work quite as intended.<ref name=\"comics.org\">[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=41657 Comics.org Information on Eagle's 2000AD #4 reprint]. Accessed February 4, 2008</ref> His first name was likely inspired by Moore's half-memory of having read about the philosopher [[Peter Abelard]], but no specific link was implied. Snazz was Alan Moore's first recurring character for ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', and appeared in eight issues between 1980 and 1983.<ref name=\"2000ad.org\">[http://www.2000ad.org/thrillpower/2kad1.html Grant Goggans' ''Touched by the hand of Tharg'' Part One]. Accessed February 4, 2008</ref> Snazz first appeared in Moore's third ''[[ABC Warriors|Ro-Jaws]]' Robo Tales'' strip for ''2000 AD'' (and third work overall for that publication), in the two-part story \"The Final Solution\", in issues #189-190.<ref>[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=2000AD&choice=ROJAWS ''Ro Jaws' Robo Tales'' at 2000ADOnline]. Accessed February 4, 2008</ref> Moving briefly into the ''[[Future Shocks|Tharg's Future Shocks]]'' for his second storyline (third appearance) in #209, Snazz then gained his own short-lived strip in #237. 'The Man with the Double-Decker Brain' is a mutant with two brains and two sets of eyes (occasionally adorned by two sets of glasses).<ref name=\"Abelard Snazz at InternationalHero\">[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/snazz.htm Abelard Snazz at InternationalHero]. Accessed February 4, 2008</ref> Convinced - with some accuracy - of his own genius, he acted as a consultant inventor, \"offering to handle complex problems with even more complicated solutions,\" and shared many character traits that Moore would return to with the [[America's Best Comics]] character [[Jack B. Quick]] in his ''[[Tomorrow Stories]]'' anthology comic, two decades later.<ref name=\"2000ad.org\"/><ref name=\"Abelard Snazz at InternationalHero\"/>\n\nTypically his innovative solutions build upon one another to great comic effect as his initial errors are compounded in ever-more bizarre ways. [[Joe McCulloch]] describes the logical progression of two of the strips in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>Upon inventing ultra-sophisticated police robots to rid crime, Snazz winds up reducing a planet to a police state, so he invents complementary robot criminals, but then innocent citizens are getting caught in the crossfire, so he invents robot civilians to be harmlessly wasted, and eventually the robots crowd the humans off the planet. In another scenario, he creates a Virtue-Converter to transmute the unlimited selflessness of the beatific Farbian Crottle-Worms into a lucrative source of energy, at least until his callous attitude toward his beaming work-force engenders Pride within them, counteracting their virtue and spoiling the plan.</blockquote>\n\nSnazz is regularly accompanied by his robot sidekick Edwin, whose dialogue tends to revolve around variations on the phrase \"You're a genius, Master!\", serving to stroke the ego of Snazz spurring him to ever more unlikely feats of \"intelligence\", while also underscoring the humour for the reader.<ref name=\"joglikescomics.blogspot.com\">[http://joglikescomics.blogspot.com/2005/03/yuk-yuk.html Joe McCulloch's \"Yuk Yuk.\", ''Jog - the Blog''].

All bar one of the ''Abelard Snazz'' strips feature in the second of the two volumes, because as Moore explains in the introduction to \"Twisted Times\", \"The Return of the Two-Storey Brain\" did not, due to \"unintentional plagiarism\" on his part from a story by [[R.

The officials of Twopp ask Snazz for a solution to the planet's crime problem. Snazz's answer is to create a race of giant police robots, heavily armed and programmed to make unlimited arrests. Snazz is hailed as a genius by his sycophantic robot assistant, Edwin. Unfortunately, the police robots are so efficient that they arrest all of the criminals on the planet, and continue to fill out their arrest quotient by arresting citizens for minor offences, such as breaking the laws of etiquette, good taste, and grammar. With everybody getting arrested, the officials return to Snazz for help. Snazz creates a race of giant criminal robots to keep the robot police busy, thus saving innocent people from being arrested. However, the perfectly matched conflict between the robot police and robot criminals creates an all-out war which kills scores of innocent bystanders. After another visit from the officials, Snazz's latest solution is to create a race of little robot innocent bystanders to suffer in the humans\u2019 stead. This saves the people from harm, but it also leaves the planet Twopp overcrowded with robots. The humans abandon the planet, and when Snazz announces his idea of building a giant robot planet for them, the enraged officials have had enough and eject Snazz and Edwin into outer space.\n\n===\"The Return of the Two-Storey Brain!\"===\nAbelard Snazz and Edwin are rescued from deep space by a passing cruiser piloted by Hoolio Moolabar, who is despondent because he has lost his life savings on the casino world of Beteldryve. Snazz believes his genius can help Mollabar recoup his losses, and hits upon the idea of creating a time machine to make Hoolio and himself rich. After returning to Beteldryve, Snazz uses his \"Time Box\" to repeatedly place bets on games he already knows the outcome of. Snazz and Hoolio soon become the richest people in the galaxy, but Snazz subsequently loses all of their money by losing two-hundred coin-tosses against a doorman who, unbeknownst to Snazz, has been using an \u201c[[Acme Corporation|Acme]] Probability Scrambler.\u201d Edwin was unavailable to assist Snazz as he was busy getting drunk with some robot dancers. An enraged Hoolio refuses to let Snazz use the Time Box to win back their money, and instead uses it to send Snazz and Edwin back in time to when they were trapped in space. This time, when Hoolio's cruiser passes them, it doesn't stop to pick them up.  This story is missing from most reprints due to Moore's \"unintentional plagiarism\" from a story by R. A. Lafferty.\n\n===\"The Double-Decker Dome Strikes Back\"===\nAdrift in deep space with a rapidly diminishing oxygen supply, Abelard Snazz is cryogenically preserved after a passing meteor ruptures his space suit's thermostat and freezes his body. Two thousand years later, a passing race of morose, [[Viking]]-like beings, the Farbians, rescue Snazz and bring him and the corroded remains of Edwin aboard their ship. After Snazz is defrosted and gets his bearings, he gleefully disposes of Edwin's remains via the ship's garbage disposal chute. The Farbians take Snazz back to their home planet, Farbus. The Farbians believe that Snazz is a god-like being, the \u201cToglub of the Two-Fold Gaze,\u201d and worship him accordingly. They also inform Snazz that he is the fulfillment of a prophecy \u2013 that the Toglub has been sent to deliver Farbus from three major calamities: their economic crisis, caused by the \u201cFarbian Crottle\u201d weed killing all their vegetation; their energy crisis, caused by a lack of fuel; and the crisis of a [[black hole]]\u2019s imminent approach to the planet. Snazz is duly informed that, should the Toglub fail to solve these three problems in a single stroke, he will be thrown to the Piranha-Dogs. After much thought, Snazz discovers that the Farbian Crottle is overrun and fed on by the intelligent \u201cFarbian Crottle-Worms\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe most saintly and good-natured beings in known space.\u201d Snazz creates a \u201cvirtue converter\u201d to transform the worms\u2019 good thoughts into an unlimited supply of energy \u2013 thus solving the energy crisis. Snazz theorises that other races will want to harness this source of energy, and the Farbians can sell abundant supplies of Farbian Crottle to them \u2013 thus solving the economic crisis. As for the black hole, Snazz comes up with the idea of stitching up the hole with a thread-like stream of \u201ccohesive neutrinos\u201d from a faster-than-light spaceship, piloted by himself and powered by Farbian Crottle-Worms. This plan initially works, until the Farbians praise the worms. An enraged Snazz declares that all the thanks should go to him, and that the worms are merely a bunch of \u201cdo-gooder maggots\u201d and \u201cmindless invertebrates.\u201d The worms are so insulted that they lose their good thoughts, and thus the ship loses power \u2013 and is sucked into the black hole.\n\n===\"Halfway to Paradise\"===\nAbelard Snazz ends up in an [[immigration]]-authority queue where people who have fallen into black holes are processed. When Snazz informs the official that his previous occupation was being employed by the people of Farbus as the \u201cGreat God Toglub,\u201d he is dispatched to the \u201cBide-a-Wee-Twilight Dimension for Disinherited Deities.\u201d There, Snazz encounters a collection of ancient gods (mostly from [[Greek mythology]]) who have lost their power because no one believes in them anymore. Snazz appoints himself the gods\u2019 new manager, and begins a massive promotional campaign to rebrand the gods and bring them up to date, making himself rich in the process. Snazz brings the \u201cGods Revival\u2019\u201d to [[Ursa Minor]], where he introduces to the inhabitants the gods\u2019 new roles, including [[Ares]] as the God of [[Space Invaders]] Machines, [[Demeter]] as the Goddess of [[health food store|Health Food Stores]], [[Apollo]] as the [[Disco]] God, and [[Eros]] as the God of Popular [[Romantic Fiction]]. Unfortunately, the people worship the gods so much that they revert to [[human sacrifice]] to placate them. An appalled Snazz tries to convince the gods to put an end to it, but they inform him that creating barbarism \u201cis what being a god is all about!\u201d Snazz refuses to allow this, so the gods decide to banish him: Snazz is left stranded in \u201ca realm of bleak isolation\u201d from which he can only escape if he solves a puzzle left by [[Zeus]] - a gigantic [[Rubik's Cube]].\n\n===\"The Multi-Storey Mind Mellows Out!\"===\nSix million years later, Abelard Snazz is rescued from the Dimension of Bleak Desolation by a pair of [[hippies]] working for [[Amnesty International|Amnesty Intergalactic]]. Snazz is rescued just before he can use a giant crane to make the final turn to solve the giant Rubik's Cube \u2013 it took Snazz twelve thousand years to mine enough metal to build the crane, and another thirty thousand years to actually build it. The hippies take Snazz back to Earth, which has enjoyed a [[utopia]]n existence ever since [[California]] won World War 26. Snazz is dismayed that Earth has become such a \u201ctechnological paradise\u201d that there is nothing left for him to invent. However, he soon hits upon the idea of creating robot [[tennis]] players to replace human players. The hippies of City Hall agree that making tennis purely a spectator sport would make the game more \u201cmellow\u201d and more of a \u201ccommunal sharing experience.\u201d Snazz duly creates robot tennis players, gigantic enough to be seen by huge crowds. Snazz explains that the robots are highly skilled at tennis because they have been programmed with the personalities of great 20th century tennis players. Unfortunately, one of the robots has the personality of [[John McEnroe]], and after arguing with the [[tennis umpire]] during a match, the robot loses its temper and begins to destroy the stadium. The humans run for their lives, and punish Snazz by attempting to drown him in the city's giant [[Jacuzzi]].\n\n===\"Genius is Pain\"===\nBefore he falls into the giant whirlpool bath, Abelard Snazz is teleported to the other side of the universe to face trial before the Manager of the Universe. The Manager recounts all of Snazz's misadventures up to this point, and Snazz's attempt to escape by threatening him with a \u201cNeuron-Whisk\u201d fails. At the moment of pronouncing judgment, everyone begins singing \u201c[[Happy Birthday to You]]\u201d to Snazz. The Manager explains to Snazz that any citizen who passes \u201cthe six million mark\u201d is honored with a celebration and \u201cthe one gift\u201d that would make him \u201chappier than anything in the world.\u201d Snazz unwraps his \u201cperfect gift,\u201d but rather than empiric power or riches, Snazz is dismayed to discover that his gift is his old robot servant Edwin, who has been recovered from deep space and rebuilt. Overjoyed to see his old master, Edwin is as cloying as ever, and Snazz breaks down in tears of anguish, misinterpreted by those in the room as tears of gratitude. Snazz is left to reacquaint himself with Edwin, and elects to pummel the robot repeatedly instead. Between each knock, Edwin still proclaims Snazz to be \u201ca genius!\u201d\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=ABELARD 2000 AD profile]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080113114319/http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/alan-moore/twisted-times.htm Alan Moore's ''Twisted Times'' (1987) Content at FantasticFiction]\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/snazz.htm Abelard Snazz profile at International Hero]\n* [http://www.2000ad.org/thrillpower/2kad1.html Abelard Snazz information; Grant Goggans' ''Touched by the hand of Tharg'' Part One]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snazz, Abelard}}\n[[Category:2000 AD comic strips]]\n[[Category:2000 AD characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Abelard snazz.png|right|thumb|200px|Abelard Snazz.]]\n'''Abelard Snazz''' was a fictional comics character, created by  [[Alan Moore]], and first illustrated by artist [[Steve Dillon]].

[[Joe McCulloch]] describes the logical progression of two of the strips in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>Upon inventing ultra-sophisticated police robots to rid crime, Snazz winds up reducing a planet to a police state, so he invents complementary robot criminals, but then innocent citizens are getting caught in the crossfire, so he invents robot civilians to be harmlessly wasted, and eventually the robots crowd the humans off the planet.

The Manager recounts all of Snazz\u2019s misadventures up to this point, and Snazz\u2019s attempt to escape by threatening him with a \u201cNeuron-Whisk\u201d fails. At the moment of pronouncing judgment, everyone begins singing \u201c[[Happy Birthday to You]]\u201d to Snazz. The Manager explains to Snazz that any citizen who passes \u201cthe six million mark\u201d is honored with a celebration and \u201cthe one gift\u201d that would make him \u201chappier than anything in the world.\u201d Snazz unwraps his \u201cperfect gift,\u201d but rather than empiric power or riches, Snazz is dismayed to discover that his gift is his old robot servant Edwin, who has been recovered from deep space and rebuilt. Overjoyed to see his old master, Edwin is as cloying as ever, and Snazz breaks down in tears of anguish, misinterpreted by those in the room as tears of gratitude. Snazz is left to reacquaint himself with Edwin, and elects to pummel the robot repeatedly instead. Between each knock, Edwin still proclaims Snazz to be \u201ca genius!\u201d\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=ABELARD 2000 AD profile]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080113114319/http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/alan-moore/twisted-times.htm Alan Moore's ''Twisted Times'' (1987) Content at FantasticFiction]\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/snazz.htm Abelard Snazz profile at International Hero]\n* [http://www.2000ad.org/thrillpower/2kad1.html Abelard Snazz information; Grant Goggans' ''Touched by the hand of Tharg'' Part One]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snazz, Abelard}}\n[[Category:2000 AD comic strips]]\n[[Category:2000 AD characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: doesn\u2019t \u2192 doesn't, \u2019s \u2192 's (10)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelard_Snazz"}
