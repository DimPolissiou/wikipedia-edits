His wife, Elizabeth, died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando's eldest brother, Edward, to care for the orphaned children. Of these children only the eldest son, [[Christopher Gibbons]], became a musician.\n\n==Music==\nOne of the most versatile English composers of his time, Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]] for [[viol]]s, a number of [[madrigal]]s (the best-known being \"[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]\"), and many popular [[verse anthem]]s, all to English texts (the best known being \"Great Lord of Lords\"). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', which sets an [[Advent]] text for solo [[countertenor]] or [[tenor]], alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text's rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons's full anthems include the expressive ''O Lord, in thy wrath'', and the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] anthem ''O clap your hands together'' (after Psalm 47) for eight voices.\n\nHe contributed six pieces to the first printed collection of keyboard music in England, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' (to which he was by far the youngest of the three contributors), published in about 1611. Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in ''Pavane in D minor'' and ''Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard''.<ref>[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]]. 1972.

Then here upon (his death being so sudden) rumours were cast out that he did die of the plague, whereupon we . . . caused his body to be searched by certain women that were sworn to deliver the truth, who did affirm that they never saw a fairer corpse. Yet notwithstanding we to give full satisfaction to all did cause the skull to be opened in our presence & we carefully viewed the body, which we found also to be very clean without any show or spot of any contagious matter. In the brain we found the whole & sole cause of his sickness namely a great admirable blackness & syderation in the outside of the brain.

His wife, Elizabeth, died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando's eldest brother, Edward, to care for the orphaned children. Of these children only the eldest son, [[Christopher Gibbons]], became a musician.\n\n==Music==\nOne of the most versatile English composers of his time, Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]] for [[viol]]s, a number of [[madrigal]]s (the best-known being \"[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]\"), and many popular [[verse anthem]]s, all to English texts (the best known being \"Great Lord of Lords\"). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', which sets an [[Advent]] text for solo [[countertenor]] or [[tenor]], alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text's rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons's full anthems include the expressive ''O Lord, in thy wrath'', and the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] anthem ''O clap your hands together'' (after Psalm 47) for eight voices.\n\nHe contributed six pieces to the first printed collection of keyboard music in England, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' (to which he was by far the youngest of the three contributors), published in about 1611. Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in ''Pavane in D minor'' and ''Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard''.<ref>[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]]. 1972.

Then here upon (his death being so sudden) rumours were cast out that he did die of the plague, whereupon we . . . caused his body to be searched by certain women that were sworn to deliver the truth, who did affirm that they never saw a fairer corpse. Yet notwithstanding we to give full satisfaction to all did cause the skull to be opened in our presence & we carefully viewed the body, which we found also to be very clean without any show or spot of any contagious matter. In the brain we found the whole & sole cause of his sickness namely a great admirable blackness & syderation in the outside of the brain.
