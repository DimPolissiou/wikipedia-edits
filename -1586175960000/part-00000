Founded as a [[railway town]], it quickly became a logging community and the surrounding lakes made it a [[resort town]]. Today, it exists in part as a [[commuter town]] to jobs in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] metropolitan area.<ref>http://www.pinecitymn.com/news/study-pine-county-workers-have-th-longest-commute/article_64bb7786-6caf-11e7-85be-eb61666a5f4b.html</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Pine City Aerial.JPG|thumb|left|Historic Pine City Aerial, overlooking the railroad]]\nThe [[Sioux|Dakota]] Indians were the first in the area.  With the [[Ojibwa#Post-contact with Europeans|Ojibwa expansion]], the area became a mixture of the two. By the early 19th century, the area became predominantly [[Ojibwa]]. They trapped and hunted on the land and [[fur trade|traded furs]] at the nearby trading posts. With the [[Treaty of St. Peters]] of 1837, dubbed the \"White Pine Treaty\", lumbering began in the area. Lumbering, though, was limited by access to the available waterways.\n\nIn the late 19th century, European settlers came to the Pine City area, which was still heavily forested with thick stands of [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]], some of the largest in the state. When the railroad arrived in Pine City so began a logging expansion. Pine City prospered and grew into a city that had everything needed to serve residents, farmers, and the fast expanding lumber industry. Pine City was [[plat]]ted in 1869.<ref>{{cite book|last=Upham|first=Warren|title=Minnesota Geographic Names: Their Origin and Historic Significance|url=https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog|year=1920|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|page=[https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog/page/n432 413]}}</ref> The city was incorporated in 1881.\n\nWhen [[Buchanan County, Minnesota|Buchanan County]] was merged with Pine County in 1861, the county seat was consolidated to Pine City because it was already well-established. Because of its location on the far southern edge of [[Pine County]], there have been attempts over the years to move the county seat to more centrally located [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]] and [[Sandstone, Minnesota|Sandstone]]. However, being the most populous city in the county, Pine City always prevailed as the county seat.\n\nIn 2005, the city became the first in rural Minnesota with an annual gay pride event, [[East-Central Minnesota Pride]], and one of only two rural communities to hold such an event in the United States. A book capturing Pine City's history in vintage photos was written as part of the [[Images of America]] series and became available in 2010.\n\n===Timeline===\n{{Div col}} \n* 1804 \u2013 The seasonal living of the [[Ojibwe]] changed when Europeans arrived.<ref>http://www.mnhs.org/furpost/learn/ojibwe</ref>\n* 1837 \u2013 With the [[Treaty of St. Peters]], dubbed \u201cWhite Pine Treaty\", lumbering began in the area.<ref>https://minnesotawaters.org/crosslakeofpinecounty/cross-lalesnake-river/</ref>\n* 1848 \u2013 The Ojibwe community of [[Chengwatana, Minnesota|Chengwatana]] forms as an official village.\n* 1856 \u2013 Chengwatana became the county seat for [[Pine County]].\n* 1872 \u2013 Two years after a fire at the Chengwatana courthouse, by popular vote Pine City became the county seat and a new courthouse was built.\n* 1881 \u2013 Pine City incorporated as a village west of Chengwatana due to the railroad's location west of Cross Lake.

Also, a local historical site situated along the [[Snake River (St. Croix River tributary)|Snake River]], the [[Snake River Fur Post]], has become a tourist draw; it was used by British fur traders nearly two centuries ago.\n\nPine City is also home to two golf courses, the Pine City Country Club, a nine-hole, par 36 public course that opened in 1971, and Pokegema Lake Golf Course, a course located just west of town.\n\nThe [[Pine County Fair]] takes place in Pine City each year in late July/early August. A highlight of the fair is a three-night demolition derby that is one of Minnesota's largest, drawing several thousand spectators each evening. The five-day event is a free gate fair and also features free on-site parking.\n\nThe Initiative Foundation named Pine City \"Outstanding Community\" of 2009<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwMSMTsKOZc 2009 Outstanding Community Video]</ref> and the NAMM Foundation identified it as one of the \"Best Communities for Music Education in America\" for 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref>http://www.namm.org/news/press-releases/namm-foundation-survey-reveals-best-communities-mu</ref>  In 2016, Movoto named Pine City one of \"The 7 Best Towns in Minnesota for [[LGBT]] Families\".<ref>https://www.movoto.com/guide/mn/the-7-best-towns-in-minnesota-for-lgbt-families/</ref> It is also a participant in the Green Steps program by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.<ref>https://greenstep.pca.state.mn.us/cityInfo.cfm?ctu_code=665301</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Southern PC Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Winter scene with native pines in the background]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.91|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|3.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelow is a table of average high and low temperatures throughout the year in Pine City.

Founded as a [[railway town]], it quickly became a logging community and the surrounding lakes made it a [[resort town]]. Today, it exists in part as a [[commuter town]] to jobs in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] metropolitan area.<ref>http://www.pinecitymn.com/news/study-pine-county-workers-have-th-longest-commute/article_64bb7786-6caf-11e7-85be-eb61666a5f4b.html</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Pine City Aerial.JPG|thumb|left|Historic Pine City Aerial, overlooking the railroad]]\nThe [[Sioux|Dakota]] Indians were the first in the area.  With the [[Ojibwa#Post-contact with Europeans|Ojibwa expansion]], the area became a mixture of the two. By the early 19th century, the area became predominantly [[Ojibwa]]. They trapped and hunted on the land and [[fur trade|traded furs]] at the nearby trading posts. With the [[Treaty of St. Peters]] of 1837, dubbed the \"White Pine Treaty\", lumbering began in the area. Lumbering, though, was limited by access to the available waterways.\n\nIn the late 19th century, European settlers came to the Pine City area, which was still heavily forested with thick stands of [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]], some of the largest in the state. When the railroad arrived in Pine City so began a logging expansion. Pine City prospered and grew into a city that had everything needed to serve residents, farmers, and the fast expanding lumber industry. Pine City was [[plat]]ted in 1869.<ref>{{cite book|last=Upham|first=Warren|title=Minnesota Geographic Names: Their Origin and Historic Significance|url=https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog|year=1920|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|page=[https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog/page/n432 413]}}</ref> The city was incorporated in 1881.\n\nWhen [[Buchanan County, Minnesota|Buchanan County]] was merged with Pine County in 1861, the county seat was consolidated to Pine City because it was already well-established. Because of its location on the far southern edge of [[Pine County]], there have been attempts over the years to move the county seat to more centrally located [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]] and [[Sandstone, Minnesota|Sandstone]]. However, being the most populous city in the county, Pine City always prevailed as the county seat.\n\nIn 2005, the city became the first in rural Minnesota with an annual gay pride event, [[East-Central Minnesota Pride]], and one of only two rural communities to hold such an event in the United States. A book capturing Pine City's history in vintage photos was written as part of the [[Images of America]] series and became available in 2010.\n\n===Timeline===\n{{Div col}} \n* 1804 \u2013 The seasonal living of the [[Ojibwe]] changed when Europeans arrived.<ref>http://www.mnhs.org/furpost/learn/ojibwe</ref>\n* 1837 \u2013 With the [[Treaty of St. Peters]], dubbed \u201cWhite Pine Treaty\", lumbering began in the area.<ref>https://minnesotawaters.org/crosslakeofpinecounty/cross-lalesnake-river/</ref>\n* 1848 \u2013 The Ojibwe community of [[Chengwatana, Minnesota|Chengwatana]] forms as an official village.\n* 1856 \u2013 Chengwatana became the county seat for [[Pine County]].\n* 1872 \u2013 Two years after a fire at the Chengwatana courthouse, by popular vote Pine City became the county seat and a new courthouse was built.\n* 1881 \u2013 Pine City incorporated as a village west of Chengwatana due to the railroad\u2019s location west of Cross Lake.

Even so, the words \u201cPine City village hall\u201d were carved over the east entrance.\n* 1952 \u2013 The towered, Romanesque Revival style courthouse building built in 1886 was struck by lightning, causing it to burn.\n* 1954 \u2013 In a bond issue, the county raised the money needed for a new courthouse and added it onto the north end of the one-time city hall (which ironically is used in part by city hall today), using the same marble wainscoting and terrazzo floors.

Also, a local historical site situated along the [[Snake River (St. Croix River tributary)|Snake River]], the [[Snake River Fur Post]], has become a tourist draw; it was used by British fur traders nearly two centuries ago.\n\nPine City is also home to two golf courses, the Pine City Country Club, a nine-hole, par 36 public course that opened in 1971, and Pokegema Lake Golf Course, a course located just west of town.\n\nThe [[Pine County Fair]] takes place in Pine City each year in late July/early August. A highlight of the fair is a three-night demolition derby that is one of Minnesota's largest, drawing several thousand spectators each evening. The five-day event is a free gate fair and also features free on-site parking.\n\nThe Initiative Foundation named Pine City \"Outstanding Community\" of 2009<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwMSMTsKOZc 2009 Outstanding Community Video]</ref> and the NAMM Foundation identified it as one of the \"Best Communities for Music Education in America\" for 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref>http://www.namm.org/news/press-releases/namm-foundation-survey-reveals-best-communities-mu</ref>  In 2016, Movoto named Pine City one of \"The 7 Best Towns in Minnesota for [[LGBT]] Families\".<ref>https://www.movoto.com/guide/mn/the-7-best-towns-in-minnesota-for-lgbt-families/</ref> It is also a participant in the Green Steps program by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.<ref>https://greenstep.pca.state.mn.us/cityInfo.cfm?ctu_code=665301</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Southern PC Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Winter scene with native pines in the background]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.91|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|3.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelow is a table of average high and low temperatures throughout the year in Pine City.

Suburban growth southward from greater Phoenix has begun to [[urban sprawl|spread]] into the northern parts of the county; similarly, growth northward from Tucson is spreading into the southern portions of the county. The Pinal County cities of [[Maricopa, Arizona|Maricopa]] and [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]], as well as many [[unincorporated area]]s, have shown accelerated growth patterns in recent years; such suburban development is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n==History==\nPinal County was carved out of neighboring [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] and [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] on February 1, 1875, during the [[8th Arizona Territorial Legislature|Eighth Legislature]]. In the August 18, 1899, issue of ''The Arizona Magazine,'' the name \"Pinal\" is said to come from the pine-clad mountains in the area.<ref>{{cite book |last=Granger |first=Byrd Howell |date=1983 |title=Arizona's Names (X Marks the Place) |location= Tucson, AZ |publisher= The Falconer Publishing Company |page= 483 |isbn= 0918080185}}</ref> Pinal County was the second-fastest-growing county in the U.S. between 2000 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-01.pdf|title=PopulationDistributionandChange:2000to2010|format=PDF|date=March 2011|publisher=UnitedStatesCensusBureau|page=9|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 CNN Money named Pinal County as the 2nd fastest growing county in the USA.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fastest Growing U.S. Counties|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/real_estate/1006/gallery.fastest_growing_US_counties/2.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014|date=June 21, 2010|agency=CNN Money}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pickepost Peak, AZ.jpg|thumb|Picketpost Peak, a prominent landmark above [[Superior, Arizona|Superior]].]]\n[[File:Sondes.jpg|thumb|upright|Spring wildflowers in the [[Sonoran Desert National Monument]].]][[File:Gila County-Queen Creek Tunnel-Hwy 60 in Gila County-1952-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Queen Creek Tunnel]] built in 1952]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|5374|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|5366|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.6|sqmi}} (0.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_04.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 23, 2015|date=August 23, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Mountain ranges===\n{{See also|List of mountain ranges of Arizona#Pinal County}}\n*[[Mineral Mountains, Arizona|Mineral Mountains]]\n*[[Sacaton Mountains, Arizona|Sacaton Mountains]]\n*[[Superstition Mountains]]\n*[[Waterman Mountains]]\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] - west, north\n* [[Gila County, Arizona|Gila County]] - north\n* [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham County]] - east\n* [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] - south\n\n===Major highways===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Image:I-8 (AZ).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 8 (Arizona)|Interstate 8]]\n*[[Image:I-10 (AZ).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 10 (Arizona)|Interstate 10]]\n*[[Image:US 60.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|U.S. Route 60]]\n*[[Image:US 80 (AZ historic).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 80 in Arizona#Historic U.S. Route 80|Historic U.S. Route 80]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 77.svg|20px]] [[Arizona State Route 77|State Route 77]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 79.svg|20px]] [[Arizona State Route 79|State Route 79]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 84.svg|20px]] [[Arizona State Route 84|State Route 84]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 87.svg|20px]] [[Arizona State Route 87|State Route 87]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 177.svg|25px]] [[Arizona State Route 177|State Route 177]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 287.svg|25px]] [[Arizona State Route 287|State Route 287]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 347.svg|25px]] [[Arizona State Route 347|State Route 347]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 387.svg|25px]] [[Arizona State Route 387|State Route 387]]\n*[[Image:Arizona 587.svg|25px]] [[Arizona State Route 587|State Route 587]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument]]\n* [[Coronado National Forest]] (part)\n* [[Hohokam Pima National Monument]]\n* [[Ironwood Forest National Monument]] (part)\n* [[Sonoran Desert National Monument]] (part)\n* [[Tonto National Forest]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 3044\n|1890= 4251\n|1900= 7779\n|1910= 9045\n|1920= 16130\n|1930= 22081\n|1940= 28841\n|1950= 43191\n|1960= 62673\n|1970= 67916\n|1980= 90918\n|1990= 116379\n|2000= 179727\n|2010= 375770\n|estyear=2019\n|estimate=462789\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/az190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Nixon. As a result of the urban sprawl from Phoenix spreading into the county, a major political reversal has taken place between it and neighboring Maricopa County since the turn of the millennium. With an increasing number of white conservative residents, Pinal voters now trend more Republican than traditionally conservative Maricopa County as of the 2016 election. Since 2008, Pinal has become a safely Republican county.

The [[county seat]] is [[Florence, Arizona|Florence]]. The county was founded in 1875.\n\nPinal County contains parts of the [[Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation]], the [[Gila River Indian Community]] and the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]], as well as the entirety of the [[Ak-Chin Indian Community]].\n\nPinal County is included in the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-[[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]]-[[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], Arizona [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Suburban growth southward from greater Phoenix has begun to [[urban sprawl|spread]] into the northern parts of the county; similarly, growth northward from Tucson is spreading into the southern portions of the county.

With an increasing number of white conservative residents, Pinal voters now trend more Republican than traditionally conservative Maricopa County as of the 2016 election. Since 2008, Pinal has become a safely Republican county.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 980,263,<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04/04001.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref> making it Arizona's second-most populous county. The [[county seat]] is [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]],<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=June 7, 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> where nearly all of the population is centered. The county is named after the [[Pima people|Pima]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s who are indigenous to this area.\n\nPima County includes the Tucson, Arizona [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nPima County contains parts of the [[Tohono O'odham Nation]], as well as all of the [[San Xavier Indian Reservation]], the [[Pascua Yaqui Indian Reservation]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument]] and [[Saguaro National Park]].\n\nThe vast majority of the county population lies in and around the city of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] (2017 city population: 535,677), filling much of the eastern part of the county with urban development. Tucson, Arizona's second largest city, is a major commercial and academic center.

While Marcel has become famous and Pierre has not, both are happy with their lives. Pierre is happily married to Romaine, a stylish young [[flapper]]. However, Marcel meets and falls in love with her, which Marcel little suspects. Romaine carries on her affair with Marcel, even as Pierre falls ill, which she may have deliberately exacerbated with her treatment in order to [[murder]] him. Soon Marcel goes on a concert tour, and Romaine abandons Pierre for a romantic tryst. When Marcel returns, Romaine reconsiders the affair, and realizes that she loves both Pierre and Marcel. She decides that she does not want to hurt either her husband or her lover, and as no other solution seems possible, she commits [[suicide]]. Three years later, Pierre visits Marcel to seek the truth, and Marcel tells him that no illicit affair occurred, thereby honoring her memory.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Sabine Az\u00e9ma]] as Romaine Belcroix\n*[[Fanny Ardant]] as Christiane Levesque\n*[[Pierre Arditi]] as Pierre Belcroix\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]] as Marcel Blanc\n*[[Jacques Dacqmine]] as Dr. Remy\n*[[Hubert Gignoux]] as Le Pr\u00eatre\n*[[Catherine Arditi]] as Yvonne\n\n==Reception==\nVincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that ''M\u00e9lo'', \"though it appears to be limpid, is as maddening as ''Marienbad.'' It's not obscure, but it's difficult to understand what it is about the project that so fascinates this most sophisticated and intellectual of French film makers.\" Describing the film, he wrote, \"Though the camera moves in for close-ups from time to time, the sets and lighting are intentionally artificial. A curtain falls between acts, and scenes are played in extended, fluid, unbroken takes that evoke the theatrical experience.

While Marcel has become famous and Pierre has not, both are happy with their lives. Pierre is happily married to Romaine, a stylish young [[flapper]]. However, Marcel meets and falls in love with her, which Marcel little suspects. Romaine carries on her affair with Marcel, even as Pierre falls ill, which she may have deliberately exacerbated with her treatment in order to [[murder]] him. Soon Marcel goes on a concert tour, and Romaine abandons Pierre for a romantic tryst. When Marcel returns, Romaine reconsiders the affair, and realizes that she loves both Pierre and Marcel. She decides that she does not want to hurt either her husband or her lover, and as no other solution seems possible, she commits [[suicide]]. Three years later, Pierre visits Marcel to seek the truth, and Marcel tells him that no illicit affair occurred, thereby honoring her memory.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Sabine Az\u00e9ma]] as Romaine Belcroix\n*[[Fanny Ardant]] as Christiane Levesque\n*[[Pierre Arditi]] as Pierre Belcroix\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]] as Marcel Blanc\n*[[Jacques Dacqmine]] as Dr. Remy\n*[[Hubert Gignoux]] as Le Pr\u00eatre\n*[[Catherine Arditi]] as Yvonne\n\n==Reception==\nVincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that ''M\u00e9lo'', \"though it appears to be limpid, is as maddening as ''Marienbad.'' It's not obscure, but it's difficult to understand what it is about the project that so fascinates this most sophisticated and intellectual of French film makers.\" Describing the film, he wrote, \"Though the camera moves in for close-ups from time to time, the sets and lighting are intentionally artificial. A curtain falls between acts, and scenes are played in extended, fluid, unbroken takes that evoke the theatrical experience. Unfortunately, the film's opening scene sets such a high standard that nothing that follows can come up to it.\"<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/05/movies/film-festival-alain-resnais-s-melo-from-a-1929-romance.html</ref>\n\nScott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that Resnais' films involve \"seeing just how far he can ostensibly push an audience away by exposing his artistic scaffolding ... all the while stealthily drawing us closer in.
