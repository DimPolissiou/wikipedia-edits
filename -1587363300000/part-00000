He uses a whip-like [[bolas]] in combat, with which he can render himself invisible to the naked eye.\n\nIn the episode \"All That Glitters,\" Lion-O instructs Tygra, \"If I do not return, you will be the new Lord of the ThunderCats.\" This verifies that Tygra is second-in-command.

It passes [[Sellafield]] and [[Ravenglass]] before ending at the [[Dalton-in-Furness]] by-pass, in southern Cumbria, where it joins the [[A590 road|A590]] trunk road. The road is mostly [[single carriageway]], apart from in central Carlisle, where it passes the [[Carlisle Castle|castle]] as a busy [[dual carriageway]] road named Castle Way, and prior to that as Bridge Street and Church Street, where it passes close to the [[McVitie's]] or [[Carr's]] [[biscuit]] factory. The Lillyhall bypass is also dual carriageway.\n\nThe road in the [[Whitehaven]] area was laid out in the 1930s and the A595 was designated a trunk route in 1946. It was detrunked in 1998, apart from an {{Convert|18|mi|adj=on}} section between Little Clifton and [[Calder Bridge]]. This section represents the route from [[Sellafield]] to the [[A66 road (England)|A66]].\n\nAt Duddon Bridge and at Dove Ford near Grizebeck the road passes through farmyards.\n\n==Route==\n\n===Northern section===\nThe {{convert|85|mi|adj=on}} long A595 is also known as the Cumbrian Coast Road despite much of the road following in an inland route. Starting at the Hardwicke Circus roundabout junction with the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], it forms a short section of dual carriageway known as Castle Way. This section passes [[Carlisle Castle]] and [[Tullie House]]. Prior to the construction of Castle Way, the road was split in 2 at this section. It then continues over Caldew Bridge to a thoroughfare called Caldewgate, before arriving at a roundabout close to the [[McVitie's]] factory in the city centre. It then follows the route of Wigton Road through the district of Morton, before reaching the outer boundary of Carlisle. At this point it passes the start point of the Carlisle Northern Development Route, where construction work commenced in 2009. This route is the A689.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\">http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A595</ref> A further roundabout was constructed in 2011 around 1 mile south of Carlisle in anticipation of increased traffic for a nearby garden centre development.\n\nThe route continues in a south-westerly direction until it reaches a roundabout on the outskirts of [[Thursby]] at a junction with [[A596 road|A596]]. The roads previously met in the centre of the village of Thursby, before the construction of the Thursby bypass in the 1980s. The A595 runs largely parallel to [[A596]], before the [[A596]] terminates in Workington.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe road then continues in a southerly direction, passing close to the town of [[Wigton]]. A staggered crossroads at the section provides access to Wigton and also the [[B5305 road|B5305]] towards [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]. The twin transmitters of [[Caldbeck]] and [[Sandale transmitting station|Sandale]] are visible close to this section of the road.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe next section follows a meandering path through several hamlets, before reaching the village of [[Bothel, Cumbria|Bothel]], where the [[A591]] from [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] terminates. The road then passes the site of the former Moota motel. This section of the route is notable for the two long straight sections, which are fairly rare on the A595. The road once again meanders until the roundabout junction with the [[A594 road (Cumbria)|A594]] road from [[Cockermouth]] to [[Maryport]]. It then passes over the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]] via Papcastle Bridge before turning west and becoming the part of the [[A66 road (England)|A66]] until Little Clifton. During the [[2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods|2009 Cumbrian floods]], the Papcastle bridge was briefly closed, essentially splitting [[West Cumbria]] in two. With bridge collapses and damage on the nearby [[A596]], and a road closure on the [[A591]], the only passable route to anywhere north of the River Derwent was via the [[A66 road|A66]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] - a diversion of over {{convert|90|mi}}.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nAt this point the road turns towards Lillyhall, passing through Lillyhall Industrial Estate and joining the [[Distington]] bypass, constructed in 2008. This section of road is notable as it is the only section of national speed limit dual carriageway along the whole length of the road. The end of the dual carriageway section is a roundabout junction near [[Lowca]] rejoining the original A595 road. It is then a short journey along the coast to the edge of [[Whitehaven]].<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\n===Southern section===\nThe road passes through Loop Road North & Loop Road South in [[Whitehaven]] passing the suburbs of the Highlands, Hill Crest and [[Hensingham]]. It forms the [[Hensingham]] bypass at this section, constructed in the 1980s to ease the passage of construction traffic to [[Sellafield]] through a particularly narrow and busy section of the road. It then passes close to [[West Cumberland Hospital]] and West Lakes Science & Technology Park. There is a campaign to build a bypass from the recently built [[Distington]] Bypass to this part of the A595 to ease congestion in the [[Whitehaven]] area.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nAfter this, the road the passes near to [[Moor Row]] and through the centre of Bigrigg, before heading downhill to [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]]. The northbound side of the road here was upgraded in the 1980s to provide an extra uphill lane for overtaking due to the steep gradient. At the bottom of the hill the roundabout forms a junction with the B5086 which gives access to [[Cleator Moor]] and eventually [[Cockermouth]].<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe A595 the forms the [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]] bypass. This bypass was built in the early '90s as a result of an investment by [[BNFL]] in local infrastructure following the siting of the THORP reprocessing plant at [[Sellafield]]. Prior to the bypass, the A595 originally passed right through the middle of town of Egremont. Once past the village of Thornhill, you can then see the sprawling [[Sellafield]] nuclear site. Twin cooling towers previously dominated the skyline here. However, they were demolished in 2007.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe road then passes [[Beckermet]] and [[Calder Bridge]], junctions here give access to the [[Sellafield]] site. From Calder Bridge, the A595 forms the boundary of the [[Lake District National Park]], going between the villages of [[Seascale]] and [[Gosforth, Cumbria|Gosforth]]. It enters the national park at the bridge over the [[River Irt]] at Holmrook and continues past the village of [[Ravenglass]], then passes through [[Waberthwaite, Cumbria|Waberthwaite]] and [[Bootle, Cumbria|Bootle]] and round the foot of [[Black Combe]].<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" /><ref name=\"OS OL6\">{{cite map | title = The English Lakes South-Western Area: OL6|date = March 2015|scale = 1:25,000|series = OS Explorer|publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]]}}</ref>\n\nAt Whicham the road has a [[List of road-related terminology#T|TOTSO]] (turn off to stay on) junction with the [[A5093 road|A5093]], close to the town of [[Millom]], taking a north-easterly route along Whicham Valley. For much of this stretch, the road is close to or is the boundary of the Lake District National Park. At [[Duddon Bridge]], the road crosses the river Duddon which previously marked the boundary of the historic county of [[Cumberland]] and [[Lancashire]]. The road then turns towards [[Broughton-in-Furness]] and used to go through it but now diverts via Foxfield before turning north to rejoin its old route, then once again turning south. At Grizebeck, the [[A5092 road|A5092]] then branches off the road to connect with the [[A590]] forming another TOTSO. This is also the point at which the A595 ceases to be the boundary to the Lake District National Park.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />{{r|OS OL6}}\n\nThe road finally passes through [[Kirkby-in-Furness]], Ireleth and [[Askam-in-Furness]] before terminating {{convert|1.8|mi}} further south at Elliscales roundabout where it crosses the Dalton bypass [[A590]].\n\nThe last section of the road is particularly narrow and even passes through a farmyard.<ref>{{cite news|title=Residents asked how to improve the A595 |url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/residents-asked-how-to-improve-the-a595-1.741880? |accessdate=20 January 2011 |newspaper=North West Evening Mail |date=3 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005172450/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/residents-asked-how-to-improve-the-a595-1.741880 |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n\nThe road, along with the A66, is considered to be the most dangerous road in Cumbria.<ref>[http://www.timesandstar.co.uk/1.143669 Times & Star - Detrunked A595 more dangerous] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719185210/http://www.timesandstar.co.uk/1.143669 |date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> There are several accident blackspots along the length of the road.

It passes [[Sellafield]] and [[Ravenglass]] before ending at the [[Dalton-in-Furness]] by-pass, in southern Cumbria, where it joins the [[A590 road|A590]] trunk road. The road is mostly [[single carriageway]], apart from in central Carlisle, where it passes the [[Carlisle Castle|castle]] as a busy [[dual carriageway]] road named Castle Way, and prior to that as Bridge Street and Church Street, where it passes close to the [[McVitie's]] or [[Carr's]] [[biscuit]] factory. The Lillyhall bypass is also dual carriageway.\n\nThe road in the [[Whitehaven]] area was laid out in the 1930s and the A595 was designated a trunk route in 1946. It was detrunked in 1998, apart from an {{Convert|18|mi|adj=on}} section between Little Clifton and [[Calder Bridge]]. This section represents the route from [[Sellafield]] to the [[A66 road (England)|A66]].\n\nAt Duddon Bridge and at Dove Ford near Grizebeck the road passes through farmyards.\n\n==Route==\n\n===Northern section===\nThe {{convert|85|mi|adj=on}} long A595 is also known as the Cumbrian Coast Road despite much of the road following in an inland route. Starting at the Hardwicke Circus roundabout junction with the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], it forms a short section of dual carriageway known as Castle Way. This section passes [[Carlisle Castle]] and [[Tullie House]]. Prior to the construction of Castle Way, the road was split in 2 at this section. It then continues over Caldew Bridge to a thoroughfare called Caldewgate, before arriving at a roundabout close to the [[McVitie's]] factory in the city centre. It then follows the route of Wigton Road through the district of Morton, before reaching the outer boundary of Carlisle. At this point it passes the start point of the Carlisle Northern Development Route, where construction work commenced in 2009. This route is the A689.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\">http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A595</ref> A further roundabout was constructed in 2011 around 1 mile south of Carlisle in anticipation of increased traffic for a nearby garden centre development.\n\nThe route continues in a south-westerly direction until it reaches a roundabout on the outskirts of [[Thursby]] at a junction with [[A596 road|A596]]. The roads previously met in the centre of the village of Thursby, before the construction of the Thursby bypass in the 1980s. The A595 runs largely parallel to [[A596]], before the [[A596]] terminates in Workington.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe road then continues in a southerly direction, passing close to the town of [[Wigton]]. A staggered crossroads at the section provides access to Wigton and also the [[B5305 road|B5305]] towards [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]. The twin transmitters of [[Caldbeck]] and [[Sandale transmitting station|Sandale]] are visible close to this section of the road.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe next section follows a meandering path through several hamlets, before reaching the village of [[Bothel, Cumbria|Bothel]], where the [[A591]] from [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] terminates. The road then passes the site of the former Moota motel. This section of the route is notable for the two long straight sections, which are fairly rare on the A595. The road once again meanders until the roundabout junction with the [[A594 road (Cumbria)|A594]] road from [[Cockermouth]] to [[Maryport]]. It then passes over the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]] via Papcastle Bridge before turning west and becoming the part of the [[A66 road (England)|A66]] until Little Clifton. During the [[2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods|2009 Cumbrian floods]], the Papcastle bridge was briefly closed, essentially splitting [[West Cumbria]] in two. With bridge collapses and damage on the nearby [[A596]], and a road closure on the [[A591]], the only passable route to anywhere north of the River Derwent was via the [[A66 road|A66]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] - a diversion of over {{convert|90|mi}}.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nAt this point the road turns towards Lillyhall, passing through Lillyhall Industrial Estate and joining the [[Distington]] bypass, constructed in 2008. This section of road is notable as it is the only section of national speed limit dual carriageway along the whole length of the road. The end of the dual carriageway section is a roundabout junction near [[Lowca]] rejoining the original A595 road. It is then a short journey along the coast to the edge of [[Whitehaven]].<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\n===Southern section===\nThe road passes through Loop Road North & Loop Road South in [[Whitehaven]] passing the suburbs of the Highlands, Hill Crest and [[Hensingham]]. It forms the [[Hensingham]] bypass at this section, constructed in the 1980s to ease the passage of construction traffic to [[Sellafield]] through a particularly narrow and busy section of the road. It then passes close to [[West Cumberland Hospital]] and West Lakes Science & Technology Park. There is a campaign to build a bypass from the recently built [[Distington]] Bypass to this part of the A595 to ease congestion in the [[Whitehaven]] area.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nAfter this, the road the passes near to [[Moor Row]] and through the centre of Bigrigg, before heading downhill to [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]]. The northbound side of the road here was upgraded in the 1980s to provide an extra uphill lane for overtaking due to the steep gradient. At the bottom of the hill the roundabout forms a junction with the B5086 which gives access to [[Cleator Moor]] and eventually [[Cockermouth]].<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe A595 the forms the [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]] bypass. This bypass was built in the early '90s as a result of an investment by [[BNFL]] in local infrastructure following the siting of the THORP reprocessing plant at [[Sellafield]]. Prior to the bypass, the A595 originally passed right through the middle of town of Egremont. Once past the village of Thornhill, you can then see the sprawling [[Sellafield]] nuclear site. Twin cooling towers previously dominated the skyline here. However, they were demolished in 2007.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />\n\nThe road then passes [[Beckermet]] and [[Calder Bridge]], junctions here give access to the [[Sellafield]] site. From Calder Bridge, the A595 forms the boundary of the [[Lake District National Park]], going between the villages of [[Seascale]] and [[Gosforth, Cumbria|Gosforth]]. It enters the national park at the bridge over the [[River Irt]] at Holmrook and continues past the village of [[Ravenglass]], then passes through [[Waberthwaite, Cumbria|Waberthwaite]] and [[Bootle, Cumbria|Bootle]] and round the foot of [[Black Combe]].<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" /><ref name=\"OS OL6\">{{cite map | title = The English Lakes South-Western Area: OL6|date = March 2015|scale = 1:25,000|series = OS Explorer|publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]]}}</ref>\n\nAt Whicham the road has a [[List of road-related terminology#T|TOTSO]] (turn off to stay on) junction with the [[A5093 road|A5093]], close to the town of [[Millom]], taking a north-easterly route along Whicham Valley. For much of this stretch, the road is close to or is the boundary of the Lake District National Park. At [[Duddon Bridge]], the road crosses the river Duddon which previously marked the boundary of the historic county of [[Cumberland]] and [[Lancashire]]. The road then turns towards [[Broughton-in-Furness]] and used to go through it but now diverts via Foxfield before turning north to rejoin its old route, then once again turning south. At Grizebeck, the [[A5092 road|A5092]] then branches off the road to connect with the [[A590]] forming another TOTSO. This is also the point at which the A595 ceases to be the boundary to the Lake District National Park.<ref name=\"sabre-roads\" />{{r|OS OL6}}\n\nThe road finally passes through [[Kirkby-in-Furness]], Ireleth and [[Askam-in-Furness]] before terminating {{convert|1.8|mi}} further south at Elliscales roundabout where it crosses the Dalton bypass [[A590]].\n\nThe last section of the road is particularly narrow and even passes through a farmyard.<ref>{{cite news|title=Residents asked how to improve the A595 |url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/residents-asked-how-to-improve-the-a595-1.741880? |accessdate=20 January 2011 |newspaper=North West Evening Mail |date=3 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005172450/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/residents-asked-how-to-improve-the-a595-1.741880 |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n\nThe road, along with the A66, is considered to be the most dangerous road in Cumbria.<ref>[http://www.timesandstar.co.uk/1.143669 Times & Star - Detrunked A595 more dangerous] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719185210/http://www.timesandstar.co.uk/1.143669 |date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> There are several accident blackspots along the length of the road.
