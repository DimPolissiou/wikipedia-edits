The only Archies song not to feature Ron Dante on lead was 1971's \"Love Is Living In You\", sung by Bob Levine (co-author of the song) and produced by Ritchie Adams. The last single, released 1972, was \"Strangers in the Morning\"; its B-side song was \"Plum Crazy\".\n\n[[Jeff Barry]], [[Andy Kim]], [[Ellie Greenwich]], Susan Morse, [[Ritchie Adams]], Maeretha Stewart, [[Bobby Bloom]] and [[Lesley Miller]], contributed background vocals at various times, with Barry contributing his trademark bass voice (portrayed as being sung by Jughead in the cartoon) on cuts such as \"Jingle Jangle\", \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\", \"A Summer Prayer For Peace\" (which hit number one in South Africa and Scandinavia in 1971), and \"You Little Angel, You\". Musicians on Archies records included guitarists [[Hugh McCracken]] and Dave Appell, bassists [[Chuck Rainey]] and Joey Macho, keyboard player Ron Frangipane, and drummers [[Buddy Saltzman]] and [[Gary Chester]].\n\nThe Archies' records were initially released on the Calendar Records label,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> but the name was shortly thereafter changed to Kirshner Records.\n\nThe sound engineer was Fred Weinberg, who was Jeff Barry's and Andy Kim's favorite, and who also recorded Barry's other hits \"[[Be My Baby]]\", \"[[Baby, I Love You]]\", and Kim's \"[[Rock Me Gently (Andy Kim song)|Rock Me Gently]]\". Fred Weinberg is an award-winning composer and producer in his own right. However, the music for ''[[The U.S. of Archie]]'' TV show which aired in 1974, was produced by Jackie Mills, a Hollywood producer, who also produced [[Bobby Sherman]] and the [[The Brady Kids|Brady Kids]]. The vocalist for these shows was Tom McKenzie, who also sang on some ''[[Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies|Groovie Goolies]]'' segments, and was a regular member of the popular singing group, [[The Doodletown Pipers|Doodletown Pipers]].\n\nAlthough the verses of \"Jingle Jangle\" seem to be sung by either [[Betty Cooper|Betty]] or [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]] (the only two female members of the fictional group), the song was actually sung by Dante, using a [[falsetto]] voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbutforgottenoldies.net/interviews/ron-dante/ |title=Interview With Ron Dante |publisher=Allbutforgottenoldies.net |date=2004-10-09 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> \n\nLegendary animator [[Don Bluth]] worked on the show, providing layouts for the series.\n\nSome of the group songs have appeared on episodes from [[The CW]] television series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/artist/the-archies|title=Music from The Archies|work=[[Tunefind]]|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref> The Archies made a live action debut appearance in ''Riverdale'', in the musical episode \"[[Chapter Seventy-Four: Wicked Little Town]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2020/01/28/riverdale-hedwig-musical-episode-season-4/|title=Riverdale Sizes Up Hedwig for Season 4 Musical Episode \u2014 See Who's Singing|last=Swift|first=Andy|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 28, 2020|accessdate=February 21, 2020}}</ref> It includes [[KJ Apa]] as Archie, [[Cole Sprouse]] as Jughead, [[Lili Reinhart]] as Betty, [[Camila Mendes]] as Veronica and [[Casey Cott]] as [[Kevin Keller (comics)|Kevin Keller]].

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the City and Borough had a population of 31,276. In 2018, the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau was 32,113, making it the second most populous city in [[Alaska]] after [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>  Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from [[Quebec]], [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]], though the place was for a time called ''Rockwell'' and then ''Harrisburg'' (after Juneau's co-prospector, [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]]). The Tlingit name of the town is {{lang|tli|Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni}} (\"Base of the Flounder's River,\" {{lang|tli|dz\u00e1nti}} 'flounder,' {{lang|tli|\u2013k\u02bci}} 'base,' {{lang|tli|h\u00e9en}} 'river'), and [[Auke Bay]] just north of Juneau proper is called {{lang|tli|\u00c1ak'w}} (\"Little lake,\" {{lang|tli|\u00e1a}} 'lake,' {{lang|tli|-k\u02bc}} 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The [[Taku River]], just south of Juneau, was named after the cold {{lang|tli|t'aakh}} wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\nJuneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a ''de facto'' island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's being on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging {{convert|16|ft|m|0}}, below steep mountains about {{convert|3500|ft|m|-2}} to {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} high. Atop these mountains is the [[Juneau Icefield]], a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the [[Mendenhall Glacier]] and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\nThe [[Alaska State Capitol]] in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the [[Alaska Legislature|state legislature]] and the offices of the [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] and [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]]. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Taku.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Anotklosh of the Taku tribe, circa 1913]]\n\nLong before European settlement in the Americas, the [[Gastineau Channel]] was a favorite fishing ground for  the [[Auke Indians|Auke]] (''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'') and [[Taku Indians|Taku]] tribes, who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years. The ''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'' had a village and burying ground here. In the 21st century it is known as Indian Point. They annually harvested herring during the spawning season, and celebrated this bounty.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the A'akw Kw\u00e1an, together with the [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]], have resisted European-American development of Indian Point, including proposals by the [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). They consider it sacred territory, both because of the burying ground and the importance of the point in their traditions of gathering sustenance from the sea. They continue to gather clams, gumboots, grass and sea urchins here, as well as tree bark for medicinal uses.<ref name=\"nrhp\"/> The city and state supported [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]] in documenting the 78-acre site, and in August 2016 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. \"It is the first traditional cultural property in Southeast Alaska to be placed on the register.\"<ref name=\"nrhp\">[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 ICTMN Staff, \"Indian Point Goes on National Register of Historic Places\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000125/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 |date=August 21, 2016 }}, ''Indian Country Today,'' 18 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref><ref name=\"phu\">[http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection Lisa Phu, \"Feds designate Juneau's Indian Point as sacred, worthy of protection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820155548/http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection |date=August 20, 2016 }}, ''Juneau Empire,'' 16 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref>\n\nDescendants of these indigenous cultures include the [[Tlingit people]]. Native cultures have rich artistic traditions expressed in carving, weaving, orating, singing, and dancing. Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit, [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] of Southeast Alaska.\n\n===European encounters===\nAlthough the Russians had a colony in the Alaska territory from 1784 to 1867, they did not settle in Juneau. They conducted extensive fur trading with Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak.\n\nThe first European to see the Juneau area was [[Joseph Whidbey]], master of the ''[[HMS Discovery (1789)|Discovery]]'' during [[George Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver Expedition|1791\u201395 expedition]]. He and his party explored the region in July\u2013August 1794. Early in August he viewed the length of Gastineau Channel from the south, noting a small island in mid-channel. He later recorded seeing the channel again, this time from the west. He said it was unnavigable, being filled with ice.<ref name=\"Vancouver\">{{cite book| last1 = Vancouver| first1 = George| last2= Vancouver| first2= John| title = A voyage of discovery to the North Pacific ocean, and round the world| publisher = J.

In 1880, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] mining engineer [[George Pilz]] offered a reward to any local Native in Alaska who could lead him to gold-bearing ore. A local Native arrived with some ore, and several prospectors were sent to investigate. On their first trip to Gold Creek, they found deposits of little interest. However,Pilz sent [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]] and [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]] back to the Gastineau Channel, directing them to Snow Slide Gulch (the head of Gold Creek). According to the Rev. Samuel Young, in his book Alaska Days with John Muir, it was their party's campsite at the creek head that Juneau and Harris decided to explore, in the summer of 1879. There they found nuggets \"as large as peas and beans,\" in Harris' words.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Juneau City, 1887.jpg|thumb|Juneau City in 1887]]\nOn October 18, 1880, the two men marked a {{convert|160|acre|m2|adj=on}} town site where soon a mining camp sprang up. Within a year, so many miners had arrived that the camp became a village, albeit made up mostly of tents and shacks rather than substantial buildings. It was the first [[European American]] settlement founded in this territory after the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]].\n\nBy the autumn of 1881, the village had a population of over 100 and was known as Rockwell, after Lt. Com. Charles Rockwell; later it was known as Harrisburg after prospector Richard Harris.  On December 14, 1881, a miners' meeting of 72 persons decided to name the settlement Juneau, after [[prospecting|prospector]] Joe Juneau.<ref name=Spencer>{{Cite book |author=Arthur C.

It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the [[Tlingit language]] in the 1830s\u20131840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to come to their settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church was completed in 1894 and has maintained a strong presence among the Tlingit, Serbians, and other Europeans who followed this church. The iconostasis has six large panels sent from Russia.<ref name=nrhpdoc>{{cite web |url={{NRHP url|id=73000377}} |title=St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church |author=Amos Wallace |date=April 10, 1973 |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=73000377|title=accompanying photos from 1961 and 1972|photos=y}}</ref>\n\n===Development of mining===\nDuring this period, prospector and [[placer mine]]r [[John Lemon (prospector)|John Lemon]] operated in what is today the [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]] area. The neighborhood that developed there was named for him by early settlers, as have been several other landmarks in Juneau.\n\nMajor mining operations in the [[Juneau mining district]] prior to World War II included the [[Treadwell gold mine|Treadwell Mine]], [[Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company|The Alaska-Juneau Mine]], and [[Alaska-Gastineau Mine]].\n\nBy 1906, after the decline of whaling and the fur trade, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], the original capital of Alaska, had become less important and the territorial legislature moved the seat of government to Juneau in accordance with a 1900 federal law.<ref name=\":0\" /> Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter-war years, passing [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] in the [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]]. In the post-World War II years, it was displaced by [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in [[1950 United States Census|1950]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn 1911, the United States Congress authorized funds for construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. [[World War I]] delayed construction and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco architectural style]]. The building was originally used by the federal government to house the federal courthouse and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.\n\nThe Alaska Governor's Mansion was commissioned under the Public Building Act in 1910. The mansion was designed by [[James Knox Taylor]] in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. Construction was completed in 1912. The territorial governor at that time was the first governor to inhabit the mansion, and he held the first open house for citizens on January 1, 1913. The area of the mansion is {{convert|14400|sqft|m2}}. It has ten bathrooms, six bedrooms, and eight fireplaces. The governor resides here when in Juneau on official business. In June 1923, President [[Warren G. Harding]] became the first president to visit Alaska. Harding visited the Governor's Mansion while Territorial Governor [[Scott Bone]], who was appointed by Harding, was in office. Harding spoke from the porch of the mansion explaining his policies and met with attendees.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], more than 50 Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans residing in Juneau were [[internment of Japanese Americans|evacuated to the internment camps inland]] as a result of [[Executive Order 9066]]\u2014which authorized the forced removal of all ethnic Japanese away from their homes and businesses on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. The removal of Juneau's Japanese community during the war was later commemorated known as the ''[[Empty Chair Memorial]]'' in July 2014 during a dedication ceremony at the neighborhood of Capital School Park in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Empty Chair Project recognizes Juneau's Japanese WWII internees | url=https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | author=Jeremy Hsieh | date=July 13, 2014 | publisher=[[KTOO (FM)|KTOO]] | accessdate=July 8, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709022307/https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | archive-date=July 9, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Atwood]], then publisher of the ''[[Anchorage Times]]'' and an Anchorage \"booster,\" was an early leader in efforts to move the capital to Fairbanks, which many in both cities resisted. Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital to be at least {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]], a town {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin. Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated $900 million. A 1984 \"ultimate\" capital-move vote also failed, as did a 1996 vote.\n\n[[File:Downtown Juneau with Mount Juneau rising in the background.jpg|thumb|Downtown Juneau, with [[Mount Juneau]] in the background]]\nJuneau remains the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |title=Sean Parnell, 10th Governor of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=2011-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223217/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 }}</ref> Once Alaska was granted [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1959, Juneau's population increased along with the growth of state government.

This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the [[University of Alaska Southeast]]. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.<ref>The Associated Press.

In 2005, the [[cruise ship]] industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise outlook for 2005 shows growth|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|accessdate=November 15, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416002456/http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|archive-date=April 16, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>  While cruise ships provide an economic boost to segments of the economy, not all locals are appreciative.  The Juneau Public Library, built atop a parking garage along South Franklin Street near the [[Red Dog Saloon]], was designed to take advantage of the view of and across Gastineau Channel.  This view is often blocked by docking cruise ships, which have become so large that they tower over the five-story structure.

Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan.  The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries.

The Juneau Symphony performs regularly. The Juneau Lyric Opera and Opera to Go are the two local opera companies. The JUMP Society hosts screenings of locally made short films two times a year.\n\nDowntown Juneau has many art galleries that participate in the monthly First Friday Art Walk and annual Gallery Walk held in the first week of December. The Juneau Arts & Humanities Council coordinates events and operates the Juneau Arts & Culture Center, which features a community center, gallery and lobby shop. The [[University of Alaska Southeast]] Campus offers lectures, concerts, and theater performances.

The mayor is the titular head of the city, is the presiding officer (or chair) of the [[Assembly of the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska|Juneau Assembly]] (council), and is one of three members of that body elected [[at-large]], or areawide.  The remaining six members are elected by [[single-member district]]s: two districts have been defined by the Assembly, as of its last redistricting in 2003:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|title=CBJ Assembly Districts|date=June 30, 2012|work=juneau.org|publisher=Office of the City and Borough of Juneau Clerk|accessdate=April 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831055407/http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|archive-date=August 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 1 precincts\n** [[Douglas, Alaska|Douglas]]\n** Juneau No. 1\n** Juneau No. 2\n** Juneau No. 3\n** [[Juneau International Airport|Juneau Airport]]\n** [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]]\n** [[Douglas Island|North Douglas]]\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 2 precincts\n** [[Auke Bay, Alaska|Auke Bay]]\n** [[Out the road|Lynn Canal]]\n** [[Mendenhall Valley]] No. 1\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 2\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 3\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 4\n|} They hire a professional city manager to handle daily affairs.\n\nThese districts are nearly aligned with the boundaries of the 31st and 32nd election districts that were established by the state.  The main difference is that the 32nd District includes communities outside the CBJ: [[Gustavus, Alaska|Gustavus]], [[Kupreanof, Alaska|Kupreanof]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] and [[Tenakee Springs, Alaska|Tenakee Springs]].  The Juneau Airport precinct is in the 31st district, which is otherwise identical to the 2nd Assembly District.\n\nSince Juneau was split into two state house districts by the state during [[redistricting]] in the early 1990s, the districts comprising downtown Juneau, Douglas Island and surrounding areas have exclusively elected [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], while the districts comprising Mendenhall Valley and surrounding areas have mostly elected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].  The 31st District is currently represented in the House by Democrat [[Andi Story]], who has been in office since 2018.  The 32nd District is represented by Democrat [[Sara Hannan]].\n\nCombined, these two election districts form [[Alaska Senate]] District Q. That seat is held by Democrat [[Dennis Egan]], a former Juneau mayor who has been in office since 2009. The last Republican to represent Juneau in the state Senate was Elton Engstrom, Jr., the father of Cathy Mu\u00f1oz. He left office at the end of his term in early 1971, after failing to be re-elected in 1970.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:left; margin:15px\"\n|+ '''Presidential Election Results for the City and Borough of Juneau 2004\u20132008'''<ref>\"2008 Presidential Election Results by House District in Alaska\".

A number of executive branch departments, as well as the legislature, are based in Juneau.  The legislature, in response to repeated pressure from [[Southcentral Alaska]] to move either the capital or the legislature, acquired and renovated several buildings in the vicinity of the [[Alaska State Capitol]], which hold committee meeting rooms and administrative offices for the [[Alaska Legislative Council|Legislative Affairs Agency]].  These buildings were named for former legislators [[Terry Miller (politician)|Terry Miller]] and Thomas B. Stewart.  Stewart, a Juneau native and son of early Juneau mayor Benjamin D. Stewart, represented Juneau in the Senate during the [[1st Alaska State Legislature]]. He later served in Juneau's [[Alaska Superior Court]] judgeship and was noted as an authority on the latter territory/early statehood eras of [[History of Alaska|Alaska's history]].\n\nThe federal government has a nine-story federal building in Juneau in the area known as \"The Flats\". Along [[Gold Creek (Juneau, Alaska)|Gold Creek]] near its mouth and a short distance east of the [[Juneau-Douglas Bridge]], the building houses numerous federal agencies, the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]], and Juneau's main [[United States Postal Service|post office]]. It was designed by [[Linn A. Forrest]] and constructed in 1966. Under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]], the Federal and Territorial Building was transferred to the new state for use as its [[Alaska State Capitol|capitol]].\n\n==Education==\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nJuneau is served by the [[Juneau School District]] and includes the following schools:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |title=Schools in the Juneau School District |access-date=December 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111190635/http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |archive-date=November 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:70%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Gastineau Elementary School\n*Harborview Elementary School\n*Riverbend Elementary School\n*Mendenhall River Elementary School\n*Glacier Valley Elementary School\n*Auke Bay Elementary School\n*Juneau Community Charter School\n*Montessori Borealis School\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School\n*[[Floyd Dryden Middle School]]\n*[[Juneau-Douglas High School]]\n*[[Thunder Mountain High School]]\n*[[Yaa\u1e35oosg\u00e9 Daakah\u00eddi Alternative High School]]\n*HomeBRIDGE ([[homeschooling]] program)\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following private schools also serve Juneau:\n* (Glacier) Valley Baptist Academy\n* Faith Community School\n* Thunder Mountain Learning Center (Formerly Thunder Mountain Academy)\n* Juneau Seventh-day Adventist Christian School\n* Juneau Montessori School\n\n===Colleges and universities===\nThe [[University of Alaska Southeast]] is within the [[Auke Bay]] community along the shore of [[Auke Lake]].

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the City and Borough had a population of 31,276. In 2018, the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau was 32,113, making it the second most populous city in [[Alaska]] after [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>  Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from [[Quebec]], [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]], though the place was for a time called ''Rockwell'' and then ''Harrisburg'' (after Juneau's co-prospector, [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]]). The Tlingit name of the town is {{lang|tli|Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni}} (\"Base of the Flounder's River,\" {{lang|tli|dz\u00e1nti}} 'flounder,' {{lang|tli|\u2013k\u02bci}} 'base,' {{lang|tli|h\u00e9en}} 'river'), and [[Auke Bay]] just north of Juneau proper is called {{lang|tli|\u00c1ak'w}} (\"Little lake,\" {{lang|tli|\u00e1a}} 'lake,' {{lang|tli|-k\u02bc}} 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The [[Taku River]], just south of Juneau, was named after the cold {{lang|tli|t'aakh}} wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\nJuneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a ''de facto'' island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's being on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging {{convert|16|ft|m|0}}, below steep mountains about {{convert|3500|ft|m|-2}} to {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} high. Atop these mountains is the [[Juneau Icefield]], a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the [[Mendenhall Glacier]] and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\nThe [[Alaska State Capitol]] in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the [[Alaska Legislature|state legislature]] and the offices of the [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] and [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]]. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Taku.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Anotklosh of the Taku tribe, circa 1913]]\n\nLong before European settlement in the Americas, the [[Gastineau Channel]] was a favorite fishing ground for  the [[Auke Indians|Auke]] (''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'') and [[Taku Indians|Taku]] tribes, who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years. The ''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'' had a village and burying ground here. In the 21st century it is known as Indian Point. They annually harvested herring during the spawning season, and celebrated this bounty.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the A'akw Kw\u00e1an, together with the [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]], have resisted European-American development of Indian Point, including proposals by the [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). They consider it sacred territory, both because of the burying ground and the importance of the point in their traditions of gathering sustenance from the sea.

Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit, [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] of Southeast Alaska.\n\n===European encounters===\nAlthough the Russians had a colony in the Alaska territory from 1784 to 1867, they did not settle in Juneau. They conducted extensive fur trading with Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak.\n\nThe first European to see the Juneau area was [[Joseph Whidbey]], master of the ''[[HMS Discovery (1789)|Discovery]]'' during [[George Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver Expedition|1791\u201395 expedition]]. He and his party explored the region in July\u2013August 1794. Early in August he viewed the length of Gastineau Channel from the south, noting a small island in mid-channel. He later recorded seeing the channel again, this time from the west. He said it was unnavigable, being filled with ice.<ref name=\"Vancouver\">{{cite book| last1 = Vancouver| first1 = George| last2= Vancouver| first2= John| title = A voyage of discovery to the North Pacific ocean, and round the world| publisher = J.

In 1880, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] mining engineer [[George Pilz]] offered a reward to any local Native in Alaska who could lead him to gold-bearing ore. A local Native arrived with some ore, and several prospectors were sent to investigate. On their first trip to Gold Creek, they found deposits of little interest. However,Pilz sent [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]] and [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]] back to the Gastineau Channel, directing them to Snow Slide Gulch (the head of Gold Creek). According to the Rev. Samuel Young, in his book Alaska Days with John Muir, it was their party's campsite at the creek head that Juneau and Harris decided to explore, in the summer of 1879. There they found nuggets \"as large as peas and beans,\" in Harris' words.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Juneau City, 1887.jpg|thumb|Juneau City in 1887]]\nOn October 18, 1880, the two men marked a {{convert|160|acre|m2|adj=on}} town site where soon a mining camp sprang up. Within a year, so many miners had arrived that the camp became a village, albeit made up mostly of tents and shacks rather than substantial buildings. It was the first [[European American]] settlement founded in this territory after the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]].\n\nBy the autumn of 1881, the village had a population of over 100 and was known as Rockwell, after Lt. Com. Charles Rockwell; later it was known as Harrisburg after prospector Richard Harris.  On December 14, 1881, a miners' meeting of 72 persons decided to name the settlement Juneau, after [[prospecting|prospector]] Joe Juneau.<ref name=Spencer>{{Cite book |author=Arthur C.

It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the [[Tlingit language]] in the 1830s\u20131840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to come to their settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church was completed in 1894 and has maintained a strong presence among the Tlingit, Serbians, and other Europeans who followed this church.

The neighborhood that developed there was named for him by early settlers, as have been several other landmarks in Juneau.\n\nMajor mining operations in the [[Juneau mining district]] prior to World War II included the [[Treadwell gold mine|Treadwell Mine]], [[Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company|The Alaska-Juneau Mine]], and [[Alaska-Gastineau Mine]].\n\nBy 1906, after the decline of whaling and the fur trade, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], the original capital of Alaska, had become less important and the territorial legislature moved the seat of government to Juneau in accordance with a 1900 federal law.<ref name=\":0\" /> Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter-war years, passing [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] in the [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]]. In the post-World War II years, it was displaced by [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in [[1950 United States Census|1950]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn 1911, the United States Congress authorized funds for construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. [[World War I]] delayed construction and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco architectural style]]. The building was originally used by the federal government to house the federal courthouse and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.\n\nThe Alaska Governor's Mansion was commissioned under the Public Building Act in 1910. The mansion was designed by [[James Knox Taylor]] in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. Construction was completed in 1912. The territorial governor at that time was the first governor to inhabit the mansion, and he held the first open house for citizens on January 1, 1913. The area of the mansion is {{convert|14400|sqft|m2}}. It has ten bathrooms, six bedrooms, and eight fireplaces. The governor resides here when in Juneau on official business. In June 1923, President [[Warren G. Harding]] became the first president to visit Alaska. Harding visited the Governor's Mansion while Territorial Governor [[Scott Bone]], who was appointed by Harding, was in office. Harding spoke from the porch of the mansion explaining his policies and met with attendees.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], more than 50 Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans residing in Juneau were [[internment of Japanese Americans|evacuated to the internment camps inland]] as a result of [[Executive Order 9066]]\u2014which authorized the forced removal of all ethnic Japanese away from their homes and businesses on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. The removal of Juneau's Japanese community during the war was later commemorated known as the ''[[Empty Chair Memorial]]'' in July 2014 during a dedication ceremony at the neighborhood of Capital School Park in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Empty Chair Project recognizes Juneau's Japanese WWII internees | url=https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | author=Jeremy Hsieh | date=July 13, 2014 | publisher=[[KTOO (FM)|KTOO]] | accessdate=July 8, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709022307/https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | archive-date=July 9, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Atwood]], then publisher of the ''[[Anchorage Times]]'' and an Anchorage \"booster,\" was an early leader in efforts to move the capital to Fairbanks, which many in both cities resisted. Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital to be at least {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]], a town {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin. Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated $900 million. A 1984 \"ultimate\" capital-move vote also failed, as did a 1996 vote.\n\n[[File:Downtown Juneau with Mount Juneau rising in the background.jpg|thumb|Downtown Juneau, with [[Mount Juneau]] in the background]]\nJuneau remains the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |title=Sean Parnell, 10th Governor of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=2011-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223217/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 }}</ref> Once Alaska was granted [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1959, Juneau's population increased along with the growth of state government.

This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the [[University of Alaska Southeast]]. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.<ref>The Associated Press.

In 2005, the [[cruise ship]] industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise outlook for 2005 shows growth|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|accessdate=November 15, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416002456/http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|archive-date=April 16, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>  While cruise ships provide an economic boost to segments of the economy, not all locals are appreciative.  The Juneau Public Library, built atop a parking garage along South Franklin Street near the [[Red Dog Saloon]], was designed to take advantage of the view of and across Gastineau Channel.  This view is often blocked by docking cruise ships, which have become so large that they tower over the five-story structure.

Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan.  The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries.

The remaining six members are elected by [[single-member district]]s: two districts have been defined by the Assembly, as of its last redistricting in 2003:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|title=CBJ Assembly Districts|date=June 30, 2012|work=juneau.org|publisher=Office of the City and Borough of Juneau Clerk|accessdate=April 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831055407/http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|archive-date=August 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 1 precincts\n** [[Douglas, Alaska|Douglas]]\n** Juneau No. 1\n** Juneau No. 2\n** Juneau No. 3\n** [[Juneau International Airport|Juneau Airport]]\n** [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]]\n** [[Douglas Island|North Douglas]]\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 2 precincts\n** [[Auke Bay, Alaska|Auke Bay]]\n** [[Out the road|Lynn Canal]]\n** [[Mendenhall Valley]] No. 1\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 2\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 3\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 4\n|} They hire a professional city manager to handle daily affairs.\n\nThese districts are nearly aligned with the boundaries of the 31st and 32nd election districts that were established by the state.  The main difference is that the 32nd District includes communities outside the CBJ: [[Gustavus, Alaska|Gustavus]], [[Kupreanof, Alaska|Kupreanof]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] and [[Tenakee Springs, Alaska|Tenakee Springs]].  The Juneau Airport precinct is in the 31st district, which is otherwise identical to the 2nd Assembly District.\n\nSince Juneau was split into two state house districts by the state during [[redistricting]] in the early 1990s, the districts comprising downtown Juneau, Douglas Island and surrounding areas have exclusively elected [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], while the districts comprising Mendenhall Valley and surrounding areas have mostly elected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].  The 31st District is currently represented in the House by Democrat [[Andi Story]], who has been in office since 2018.  The 32nd District is represented by Democrat [[Sara Hannan]].\n\nCombined, these two election districts form [[Alaska Senate]] District Q. That seat is held by Democrat [[Dennis Egan]], a former Juneau mayor who has been in office since 2009. The last Republican to represent Juneau in the state Senate was Elton Engstrom, Jr., the father of Cathy Mu\u00f1oz. He left office at the end of his term in early 1971, after failing to be re-elected in 1970.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:left; margin:15px\"\n|+ '''Presidential Election Results for the City and Borough of Juneau 2004\u20132008'''<ref>\"2008 Presidential Election Results by House District in Alaska\".

A number of executive branch departments, as well as the legislature, are based in Juneau.  The legislature, in response to repeated pressure from [[Southcentral Alaska]] to move either the capital or the legislature, acquired and renovated several buildings in the vicinity of the [[Alaska State Capitol]], which hold committee meeting rooms and administrative offices for the [[Alaska Legislative Council|Legislative Affairs Agency]].  These buildings were named for former legislators [[Terry Miller (politician)|Terry Miller]] and Thomas B. Stewart.  Stewart, a Juneau native and son of early Juneau mayor Benjamin D. Stewart, represented Juneau in the Senate during the [[1st Alaska State Legislature]]. He later served in Juneau's [[Alaska Superior Court]] judgeship and was noted as an authority on the latter territory/early statehood eras of [[History of Alaska|Alaska's history]].\n\nThe federal government has a nine-story federal building in Juneau in the area known as \"The Flats\". Along [[Gold Creek (Juneau, Alaska)|Gold Creek]] near its mouth and a short distance east of the [[Juneau-Douglas Bridge]], the building houses numerous federal agencies, the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]], and Juneau's main [[United States Postal Service|post office]]. It was designed by [[Linn A. Forrest]] and constructed in 1966. Under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]], the Federal and Territorial Building was transferred to the new state for use as its [[Alaska State Capitol|capitol]].\n\n==Education==\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nJuneau is served by the [[Juneau School District]] and includes the following schools:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |title=Schools in the Juneau School District |access-date=December 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111190635/http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |archive-date=November 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:70%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Gastineau Elementary School\n*Harborview Elementary School\n*Riverbend Elementary School\n*Mendenhall River Elementary School\n*Glacier Valley Elementary School\n*Auke Bay Elementary School\n*Juneau Community Charter School\n*Montessori Borealis School\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School\n*[[Floyd Dryden Middle School]]\n*[[Juneau-Douglas High School]]\n*[[Thunder Mountain High School]]\n*[[Yaa\u1e35oosg\u00e9 Daakah\u00eddi Alternative High School]]\n*HomeBRIDGE ([[homeschooling]] program)\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following private schools also serve Juneau:\n* (Glacier) Valley Baptist Academy\n* Faith Community School\n* Thunder Mountain Learning Center (Formerly Thunder Mountain Academy)\n* Juneau Seventh-day Adventist Christian School\n* Juneau Montessori School\n\n===Colleges and universities===\nThe [[University of Alaska Southeast]] is within the [[Auke Bay]] community along the shore of [[Auke Lake]]. Juneau-Douglas Community College, founded in 1956, and Southeastern Senior College, established in 1972, were merged in 1980 forming the University of Alaska Juneau. The university was restructured as the University of Alaska Southeast to include Ketchikan and Sitka campuses. The university offers undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\n==Transportation==\nJuneau is not directly accessible by road, although there are road connections to several areas immediately adjacent to the city. Primary access to the city is by air and sea. Cars and trucks are transported to and from Juneau by barge or the [[Alaska Marine Highway|Alaska Marine Highway ferry system]].\n\n[[File:Alaska Marine Highway Ferry.jpg|thumb|An Alaska Marine Highway ferry boat docked in Juneau, Alaska]]\n[[File:Cruise Ships in Juneau Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|Juneau is a popular cruise ship destination.]]\n[[File:Juneau International Airport.jpg|thumb|right|Alaska Airlines flight moments after landing at [[Juneau International Airport]]]]\n[[File:View of downtown Juneau, Alaska from the Juneau-Douglas Bridge.jpg|thumb|View of downtown Juneau, Alaska from the [[Juneau-Douglas Bridge]].

In 1982 the Israelis once again used the M60 during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], equipped with upgrades such as [[explosive reactive armor]] to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks. The M60 also saw use in 1983 with [[United States invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault into Grenada. M60s delivered to Iran also served in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The United States' largest deployment of M60s was in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where the US Marines equipped with M60A1s effectively defeated Iraqi armored forces, including [[T-72|T-72M]] tanks. The United States readily retired the M60 after Operation Desert Storm, with the last units being retired from active service in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=28|title=M60 (Patton) Main Battle Tank (MBT) - United States|website=www.militaryfactory.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> M60-series vehicles continue in front-line service with a number of countries' militaries, though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield.\n\nThe M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle's service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the US and its Cold War allies, especially those in [[NATO]], and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the [[M1 Abrams]] in the US military. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles, bridge layers and combat engineering vehicles. As of 2015 [[Egypt]] is the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, [[Turkey]] is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and [[Saudi Arabia]] is third with over 650 units.\n\n==Development==\n===Impetus===\nThe United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the [[Korean War]], when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\">https://www.benning.army.mil/Armor/Historian/content/PDF/Armor%20Dev%20Cold%20War.pdf</ref> Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\"/>\n\nThe [[M47 Patton]] entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. The [[M48 Patton]] tank entered US service in 1952 but its early designs were deemed unsatisfactory by Army Field Forces (AFF). The improvements to the M48 focused on improving the 90mm main gun and fire control systems while simultaneously exploring the development of silicas glass composite armor and autoloader systems. The tank continued further development through 1955 in conjunction with its simultaneous mass production. The course of its development during the mid 1950s was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees.\n\nThe [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 program]], which began in 1955 was intended to supersede the M48. It featured a host of innovative and experimental components such as its 90&nbsp;mm smoothbore T208 cannon rigidly affixed to its turret, experimental X-shaped engine design, composite armor and infrared rangefinder. The burden of developing them, however, slowed the overall program to a crawl. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |title=The Beast of Budapest |website=HistoryNet.com |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921230135/http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |archive-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> After a brief examination of this tank's armor by a British military attach\u00e9 it was concluded that the [[Ordnance QF 20-pounder|20-pounder (84mm L/66.7)]] was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor with HEAT or APC ammunition. Its 100mm main gun was a significant advancement over the weapon of the [[T-44]]. Also there were rumors of an even larger 115mm gun in the works. These events spurred the [[United Kingdom]] to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the [[Royal Ordnance L7]] to keep the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] viable against this new Soviet tank design and the [[United States]] to develop the XM60 tank in 1957.<ref name=Halberstadt>{{Cite book |last=Halberstadt |first=Hans |title=Inside the Great Tanks |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Wiltshire, England |year=1997 |pages=94\u201396 |isbn=1-86126-270-1 |oclc=40989477 |quote=The T-54/T-55 series is the hands down, all time most popular tank in history.}}</ref> This new tank design incorporated many Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committee improvements to the M48, chiefly the use of diesel engines to increase its operational range and the use of a more powerful main gun.\n\n===Choice of components===\n\n====M68 105 mm Main Gun====\nThe main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nAn M48A2C was fit with the 90&nbsp;mm M41 and tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round. A smoothbore version of the 90&nbsp;mm, the T208E9, was mounted on the T95E1 tank and tested the T320E62 APDS round. An American version of the British L7 105&nbsp;mm gun, under the name [[Royal Ordnance L7#United States|105&nbsp;mm T254E1]], was mounted on the T95E2 and tested with British APDS ammunition. Finally, two versions of the 120&nbsp;mm gun from the M103 were trialed, the existing M58 model and a lightened variant known as T123E6 which was mounted on the T95E4.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }}\n\nThe T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=153 }} The ammunition was in two parts, shell and propellant bag, which required significant time to load. In the M103 this was addressed by adding a second loader, but a medium tank would not have the internal space needed for another crewmember and the firing rate would suffer as a result. In testing it demonstrated a maximum rate  of 4 rounds per minute vs. the T254's 7 rpm.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nBased on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the [[Royal Ordnance L7|Cannon, 105mm Gun, M68]]. It used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock.

The M60 hull had a straight slope and beak compared to the earlier M48's rounded one. The hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms and one shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.

The T95E5 turret used on the M60 was hemispherically shaped and bore a strong resemblance to the M48 Patton. The M60A1 was the first version to employ the newly designed T95E7 turret with a redesigned bustle increasing the number of rounds for the main gun to 63. The M60A2 featured a specially designed turret for the M162 gun/missile launcher that greatly reduced the frontal arc in comparison to the M60A1's T95E7 turret.  The M60A3's turret was similar to the A1's but with increased armor protection for the frontal arc and mantlet in an effort to provide additional protection of the turret's hydraulics system.\n\n====M19 Commander's Cupola====\nA redesigned full vision cupola was envisioned for the commander's station. It had 7 tiltable vision blocks arranged to give the commander a 360 degree field of view with overlapping vision between adjacent vision blocks. The front vision block could be replaced with a dual power M34 7x50 binocular day sight or an M19E1 IR periscope. A special feature was that the cupola body could be raised up to 3 1/2 inches providing the commander a direct field of vision while remaining under armor protection. Access was through a hatch cover on the roof and a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun was pedestal mounted on the forward part of the cupola. It could be aimed and fired with the cupola closed. Also there was an 11 inch long hydraulically operated port on the left side allowing spent cartridge cases to be ejected.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} After creating a full-sized mock up of this design using the [[T95 Medium Tank#Versions and modifications|T95E6 turret]], it was dropped in favor of a design based on the M1 cupola of the M48A2's turret. This T9 cupola provided the commander with more headroom than the T6 cupola of the T95 tank, carrying a new [[Receiver (firearms)|short receiver]] M85/T175 .50 caliber machine gun{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} and it was standardized as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun,<ref name=\"Direct Support 1975\" /> M19. The first M19 cupola (a modified T9) was ready on 27 October 1958. It has an M28C sight for the machine gun in the forward part of the cupola and eight vision blocks. The front vision block can be replaced by a M19E1 infrared periscope or an M36E1 passive periscope for night observation.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html |title = M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)}}</ref> Initial production of the cupola was problematic. The first 300 M60s produced were armed with a .50cal M2HB machine gun in a pedestal mount welded to the left side of the commander's cupola owing to production problems with the new M85 machine gun. Of these tanks, the first 45 manufactured were made without the cupola itself, also due to production problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Crismon, Fred W. U.S. Military Tracked Vehicles. Osceola, WI: Motorbooks International, 1992</ref> All of these early M60s eventually had the M19 cupola and M85 machine gun installed.\n\nCompared to a conventional pintle mount, the remote-controlled M85 machine gun was relatively ineffective in the anti-aircraft role for which it was designed. Removing the cupola lowered the vehicle's relatively high silhouette. The cupola's hatch also opened toward the rear of the vehicle and was dangerous to close if under small-arms fire owing to a lock-open mechanism that required the user to apply leverage to unlock it prior to closing. The commander was able to observe the battlefield using the binocular M34 vision block or M19E1 IR Periscope while remaining under armor protection with a 360 degree traverse independent of the turret,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |title=M60A3 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203428/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |archive-date=2018-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> was stabilized in azimuth and elevation<ref name=\"50megs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|title=105mm Gun Tank M60|website=afvdb.50megs.com|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528154422/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and carried 600 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |title=M60 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426112135/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |archive-date=2019-04-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> All M60s in US service retained the M19 cupola until the tank was phased out of service. The few M60A3s in Army service as training vehicles had their commander's cupola removed as it was deemed unnecessary for training and to better mimic the profile of Soviet tanks.\n\n====Main Battle Tank Designation====\nThe concept of the [[medium tank]] gradually evolved into the [[Main Battle Tank]] (MBT) in the 1960s. The MBT was to combine the firepower and protection sufficient for the assault role with the mobility to perform as a medium tank.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The main battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the \"universal tank\", exemplified by the [[Centurion (tank)|British Centurion]], filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical main battle tanks were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Yet they were cheap enough to be built in large numbers. The first generation consists of the medium tanks designed and produced directly after World War II that were later redefined as main battle tanks. These were exemplified by the [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]]s armed with  a 90mm main gun already in widespread US service. The original variant of the M60 series also fulfilled the definition of a late first generation MBT sometimes being referred to as an intermediate second generation design. The Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54 and T-55]] as well as the original configuration of the [[T-62|T-62A]] tank designs are also regarded as first generation MBTs. The second generation had enhanced night-fighting capabilities and in most cases NBC protection. Most western tanks of this generation were armed with the 105&nbsp;mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun or derivatives of it. Notable are the [[Chieftain (tank)|British Chieftain]] and [[Leopard 1|German Leopard 1]]. The United States fully committed to the main battle tank doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps deactivated its last [[M103 (heavy tank)|M103 Heavy Tank]] battalion.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|page= 327 }} The first American nomenclature-designated second generation MBT was the M60A1 version of the M60 series. The term MBT is used in strategic doctrine and the composition of force as determined by the United States Army. The M60 series tanks fulfilled the MBT role on a strategic and tactical level. It was never referred to as such in any official training or technical manuals. The first Soviet second generation main battle tank designs were the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]].<ref>\u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-62. \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0443\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. 1968</ref>\n\n===Production Versions===\n\n===XM60 Development===\nBy May 1957 it became clear that the [[T95 Medium Tank]] would not have a significant advantage over the [[M48A2]]. The X-shaped motor and electro-optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the T95 project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The course of the M48 Patton's tank production was the source of widespread Congressional debate. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2. Correctly predicting that Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and the AVDS-1790 engine. Since the main gun had not yet been specified, four XM60 weapons systems were submitted in September 1957.\n\n[[File:XM60 120 big.png|thumb|left|Concept design #1 of the XM60 mounting the T123E6 main gun and British styled gun barrel, the newly designed full-vision cupola using the T95E6 turret as preferred by the Ordnance Department.]] \nThe first concept was armed with the 120mm gun T123E6 in the long nosed T95E6 turret. This was the design preferred by the Ordnance Department. It was fitted with a newly designed full-vision commander's cupola. A full sized mock-up of this turret was constructed before this concept was dropped, mainly due to its slow rate of fire. The second carried the 105mm rifled T254E2 main gun in the T95E5 type turret and the T9 cupola style of the M48A2. The T254 guns used British X15/L52 barrels with a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 62 }} The Army Ordnance Technical Committee chose this design for production in August 1958. The third concept was to mount the 90mm T208 smooth-bore main gun and the T95E6 turret. It never progressed beyond design drawings. The fourth used the T95E1 turret and the T208 main gun. A mock-up was built using the new vision cupola. All of these conceptual designs were referred to as the XM60. A contract was awarded to Chrysler Engineering in September 1958 for the advanced production engineering (APE) of the XM60 concept #2.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }} The T95 hull was considered however its one-piece front casting was too difficult and expensive to produce in quantity. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototyping of the [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].<ref>Tank Data, vol. 3. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: US Army Ordnance School, Jul 1968.</ref> Instead the decision was made to use modified M48A2 hulls. The hulls had 3 return rollers and 6 steel roadwheel pairs per side with no shock absorbers, using only bumper springs on the first and sixth roadwheel arms, along with a widened turret well and ring, and a flat wedge-shaped glacis. The T254E2 gun was chosen to be the main weapon of the tank in August 1958 being standardized as the M68 105mm gun. After a briefing on 11 December 1958, [[Maxwell D. Taylor|General Maxwell Taylor]] ordered the XM60 into production because of the improvements it offered in firepower, protection, and cruising range.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }}  Since the tank had not yet received its official designation these prototype hulls were briefly referred to as the M68 in December 1958 until they were officially named the M60 in March 1959.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\" /> Fulfilling this requirement was an interim tank design that resulted in the M60-series,{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} which largely resembles the M48 it was based on, but has significant differences.\n\n===M60===\n[[File:M60 Pilot 1.jpg|thumb|M60 production pilot number 1 after completion by Chrysler on 2 July 1959.

Production pilot 2 was finished on 4 August and used to develop technical publications and an additional 47 tanks produced to complete the first low rate production buy. In August 1959, an engineering bid package was awarded for the second low rate production buy of M60s to be built at the Delaware Plant. Production pilot 3 was completed 2 September and went to the Detroit Arsenal Test Center for maintenance evaluations, it was then sent to Fort Knox for user trials. The fourth pilot was completed on 26 October  and was used as the master hull to verify production standards at the Detroit Tank Plant with a low-rate initial production total of 180 M60s built in 1959.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Subsequent production, starting with the October 1960 batch were built at the [[Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]], in Warren Michigan. It reached operational capability with fielding to Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> \n;Features\nThe original variant of the M60 series ultimately was produced as a quick fix engineering (QFE) upgrade of the M48 due to the Soviet Union's tank advancements of the late 1950s and the delays from developing the silicas armor and an improved turret design. The M60 mounted a 105&nbsp;mm M68 main gun with the [[bore evacuator]] mounted towards the middle of the tube carrying 57 rounds in the clamshell shaped turret style of the M48. Nine rounds were stowed in the left side of the turret bustle behind the loader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |title=90mm Gun Tank M48 Patton 48 |website=afvdb.50megs.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424102744/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |archive-date=2019-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> The remaining rounds were stored inside safe containers on the hull floor.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\"/> A new short receiver coaxial machine gun was designed for the M60 tank. This was the 7.62mm M73/T197E2 which replaced the .30 caliber M37 used on the M48A2. It had 2,000 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\"/> They had a reputation for jamming. After working to correct this, they were redesignated as the M219 in 1970.\n\n[[File:M60 PattonMediumTank.jpg|thumb|left|M60 with AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight on display at [[Mississippi Armed Forces Museum]], [[Camp Shelby]],  Mississippi]]\nThe electronics package on the M60 was essentially the same as used on the M48A2C including an improved turret control system and an all-metric measurement M16 Fire Control System (FCS), The M16 FCS consists of a new M10 ballistic drive and mechanical M16E1 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data<ref name=\"dtic.mil\">https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a141935.pdf</ref> with an M17 coincidence range finder.<ref name=\"50megs.com\"/>  The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M31E1 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIn late 1962 a kit was fielded that allowed the use of the AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight. The searchlight has both infrared and visible light capabilities and was positioned over the gun. Along with an M32 IR periscope for the gunner, M19 IR periscope and M18 IR binoculars for the commander provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] capability to the M60 and M60A1 tanks. This kit was also compatible with the M48A5.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 166\u2013167 }}\n\nThe hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms with cast aluminum roadwheels and return rollers along with a single shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. Cast aluminum road wheels were used to save weight. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.  Power was provided by the AVDS-1790-2A engine, CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and the T97E2 track assembly as used on the M48A3.<ref>afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m48patton.html</ref> The drive sprocket is located at the rear of the hull. The vehicle also provides full NBC protection for the crew using the M13A1 protection system creating a positive atmospheric pressure in the crew compartment. The positive pressure keeps contaminated air out and forces the smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. Access between the driver's compartment and the turret fighting compartment was also restricted, requiring that the turret be traversed to the rear.\n\nThe M60 was deployed to [[West Germany]] to counter the threat presented from the [[T-54]]s and [[T-55]]s of the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] as well as to South Korea but was never sent to [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] mainly due to unfavorable terrain and the general lack of significant numbers of North Vietnamese armor. In May 1961 Army Chief-of-Staff General [[George Decker]] announced that the [[United States European Command|European Command]] had been receiving the M60 to replace older tank inventory.<ref>{{cite news |title=Army to Get New Tank; M60s for Berlin Garrison Announced at Fete |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/05/21/archives/army-to-get-new-tank-m60s-for-berlin-garrison-announced-at-fete.html |accessdate=19 August 2018 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 May 1961 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819051200/https://www.nytimes.com/1961/05/21/archives/army-to-get-new-tank-m60s-for-berlin-garrison-announced-at-fete.html |archive-date=19 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> By October the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh Army]] was outfitted with many of the tanks.

A mushroom-shaped fume extractor was placed at the rear left of the turret bustle to vent smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. The addition of a shock absorber on the second roadwheel pair was also accompanied by a slight relocation of the first return roller. These modifications were needed due to the increased weight of the M60A1 turret as well as the additional hull armor.<ref>Decker, Oscar C. \"The Patton Tanks: The Cold War Learning Series.\" Camp Colt to Desert Storm: The History of U.S. Armored Forces. Eds. George F. Hofmann, Donn A. Starry. USA: University Press of Kentucky, 1999 pg.108</ref> The ammunition load for the main gun was increased to 63 rounds. Round storage was distributed between the turret bustle, with 15 ready rounds of various types were stowed and accessible for the loader, and the rest are stored inside safe containers on the hull floor.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\"/> The uncomfortable wire mesh seats for the loader and gunner were replaced with padded ones. The brake and accelerator pedal and gauges were also rearranged for more efficient and comfortable operation while the steering wheel was replaced by a T bar steering control.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 169 }} The engine and power train were supplied by the Continental AVDS-1790-2A engine and the CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and using the T97 track assembly.\n\nImprovements to the electronics package for this version included an improved electro-mechanical traverse assembly and a AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight above the gun shield.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 440 }} The M19 FCS consisted of the M17A1 coincidence rangefinder, M10A1 ballistic drive and the mechanical M19E1 ballistic computer for the gunner.<ref name=\"50megs.com\"/> The M60A1 tank uses the M68E1 variant of the gun carried in the M140 mount.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  The M68E1 gun shares the same firing characteristics as the M68. It featured several design improvements  including an updated gun hydraulic configuration, a stabilization upgrade for the gun, a gun elevation kill switch for the loader, improved ballistic drive and other component refinements.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\n;Upgrades\nAs development of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting almost 20 years. In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. As the major changes were incorporated into the production line, the vehicle model designations were changed. The first of which was Top Loading Air Cleaner (TLAC) in 1971. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life as well as easier servicing of the engine.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} Early TLAC panels were made from aluminum and were vulnerable to damage from small arms fire.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> Next came Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner's aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a back up power mode. The manual back up system permits the crew to aim and fire the weapons should the electrical/hydraulical subsystems fail.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> At a range of 2000 meters, hit probabilities of better than 70% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1s with this upgrade were denoted as the M60A1(AOS). The T142 track was fielded in 1974 which had replaceable rubber pads, better end connecters and improved service life.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} M60A1(AOS)+ was the denotation for M60A1s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the T142 track.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIntroduced in 1975 the Reliability Improved Selected Equipment (RISE) was a comprehensive upgrade of the M60A1 hull as well as integrating the previous TLAC and AOS upgrades. It included the upgraded [[Continental AV1790|AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine]] and CD-850-6 transmission that featured several changes in order to improve service life and reliability. A new 650 ampere oil cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnectors was also incorporated into the hull's electrical system{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} as well as armored steel TLAC panels and the return to the use of steel roadwheels and return rollers. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE).<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> The 1977 fielding of the passive M32E1 sight for the gunner and M36E1 periscope for the commander as well as the M24E1 IR night vision block for the driver provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 2 (GEN II)|second generation night vision]] capabilities for M60A1 and RISE tanks. These new passive gunner's sight and commander's periscope provide recognition capability at longer ranges and at relatively low night light levels (1/2 moonlight). Under starlight conditions, they will provide recognition beyond 500 meters with the use of an IR searchlight.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> During 1978 a kit for the mounting of the M240 as the coaxial machine gun was fielded.  The development of the M735 [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot|APFSDS]] ammunition required a cam update to the gun's mechanical ballistic drive for accurate firing. M60A1s configured to this standard were denoted as M60A1(RISE)+.\n[[File:US Army M551 Sheridan German village.jpg|thumb|A US Army M60A1 RISE Passive tank maneuvers through a narrow German village street while participating in [[Exercise REFORGER|REFORGER]] 1982.]]\nThe M60A1(RISE) Passive featured the implementation of all previous updates plus Kevlar spall liners for the turret, AN/VVS-2 passive night vision block for the driver, a deep water fording kit, the capability to mount Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA){{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 202 }}{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 56 }} and the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine with CD-850-6A transmission and a Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS) that visually obscured the area around the vehicle. The VEESS smokescreen system does not provide protection against infrared, thermal or laser detection. The two six-barreled, electronically fired M239 smoke grenade launchers, one on each side of the main gun and replacement of the coax machine gun with the M240C were implemented in late 1978. The smoke grenades contains a phosphors compound that masks the thermal signature of the vehicle to the enemy.  They were denoted as M60A1(RISE) Passive.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nOver the period of M60A1 tank production several essential engineering changes were incorporated. Many of these miscellaneous changes are to improve the system safety, reliability, maintainability and increase mission performance. The M60A1 tank Hull/Turret PIP Update Kit includes those items that could not be readily identified with basic major product improvements and to incorporate essential engineering changes that had occurred during M60A1 tank production. The update program included engineering changes and minor product improvements which were not part of specific product improvements, but were required to upgrade early vintage M60A1 tanks up to the current M60A1(RISE) Passive production configuration.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nThe M60A1 was in production from October 1962 until May 1980<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> and was extensively used by the US Army and Marine Corps as well as being widely exported to foreign governments. A total of 7,948 M60A1s (all variants including E60A) were built.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 327 }} Many of them were later converted to the A3 standard.\n\n===M60A2{{anchor|M60A2}}===\nDuring the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between 1800 and 2000 meters. The XM-13/MGM-51 missile system had proven itself viable, obtaining over 90% first round accuracy up to 4000 meters. But the development of a main-battle tank variant was bogged down by having too many design proposals. In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds and launching ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided-Missiles).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/|title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship'|date=7 July 2017|website=Tank Encyclopedia}}</ref> Three M60E1 tanks with T95 turrets were modified to permit the installation of the 152mm XM81 gun-launcher. Mounted on former M60 hulls, they were to provide test beds for the evaluation of the Shillelagh weapon system. Although this system was the preferred armament for the MBT-70, by late 1961 problems with the XM13 missile required that the program be reorganized. The missile was reclassified as an applied research project and it was obvious that there would be some delay before it would be available for service.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 627 }} On 10 January 1962, representatives from various ordnance organizations met at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Center (OTAC) to review armament systems that might be suitable replacements, if the Shillelagh missile could not be developed in a timely manner. Time was particularly critical for the AR/AAV (the XM551 Sheridan) which required a decision on the armament by April 1962. The possible delay was not as serious for the MBT-70 since the program was limited to conceptual design and component development. The requirements also differed for the tank because of its ability to carry a much heavier weapon system. Several backup weapons were also under consideration and concept studies were prepared showing their application to the MBT-70 concepts. The 152mm gun-launcher XM81 also was considered without the missile depending only on the combustible case conventional ammunition. It was expected that the Shillelagh or some other missile then could be introduced at a later date. The 105mm gun M68 as standardized for the M60 tank was considered as an alternate armament system. It had the advantage of being immediately available and its ammunition was already in production. Of the several turrets drafted, one of the earliest was the driver-in-turret integrated fighting compartment. This design was further developed using the [[MBT-70]]. Another proposal was a more compact turret design of the T95E7.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 pp.631-633</ref>\n\n;Development\n[[File:XM66 Type C design concept.png|thumb|Conceptual drawing of the XM66 with Type C turret]]\nDuring the development of the M60A2, three different turret types were considered, the Type A, Type B and Type C. The Type A turret would be constructed based on the T95E7 turret and then further modified and produced as the Type B standard. The Type C turret was essentially a larger [[M551 Sheridan]]-style turret. A mock-up of this turret was built, but the design was never seriously considered and soon abandoned. All of these conceptual variants were referred to as the XM66. On 10 January 1964, the Army reviewed all three variants and selected the Type A variant for further development. Initially two Type A turrets were built in 1964.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 138 }} The M60A1 hull was used starting in 1966 to develop the new compact turret design using the 152mm M162/XM81E13 rifled barrel main gun. These developmental tanks were designated as the M60A1E series.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 141 }}\n\nThe M60A1E1 referred to vehicles based on the modified T95E7 Type A turrets with M60 hulls used through 1965. The M60A1E1 variant was used to evaluate the M162/XM81E13 gun on different mounts and compatibility with the XM13 Guided Missile, Armor Defeating together with the XMTM51 training round. They used a modified M60A1/T95E7 turret. During the early testing of the M162/XM81E13 main gun it was noted that misfires and premature detonations of the M409 conventional case ammunition were caused by unburnt propellant in the bore and breech. This flaw was often catastrophic as it set off the projectile in the barrel as it was fired.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship' |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085943/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> To remedy this the guns were equipped with a traditional fume extractor on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= }} The XM81E13 Gun/Launcher also experienced frequent faulty breaches, often not closing correctly during a missile firing, allowing the exhaust of the launching Shillelagh to vent hot noxious gasses into the crew compartment.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> [[File:M60A1E1 Tank.jpg|thumb|left|M60A1E2 tank prototype with Type B turret.]] As the M60A1 hull became available in 1966, it was decided to upgrade these prototype vehicles to the M60A1 standard. Vehicles using the M60A1 hull and chassis received the M60A1E2 designation, and were used to develop the Type B compact turret.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 1/</ref> The M60A1E2 finalized the turret design with the use of a compact turret which reduced exposed frontal area by 40% compared to the M60A1 and continued development of the M51 Missile Guidance System (M51MGS).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> These were later standardized as the M60A2. Initial plans called to retrofit the turret of every M60 with the new A2 turret, and use them in the mobile anti-armor role  alongside the M60A1 tanks. But the continual technical and reliability difficulties with the dual purpose gun caused this to be abandoned. The M60A1E3 variant was a prototype mounting the M68 105&nbsp;mm rifled gun to the turret of the M60A1E2. This was evaluated due to several earlier faults noted in the M60A1E1's main gun. Compared to the Shillelagh system, the use of the 105mm gun increased the overall tank weight by about 1700 pounds.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 p.632</ref> The M60A1E4 was a conceptual variant that explored the use of various remote controlled weapons, including a 20mm gun as secondary armament. A mock-up of this design using the Type C turret was constructed.

It consisted of a large disk with a narrow channel in the center with each crew member in the turret having their own hatch. The gunner and loader were located to the right and left of the gun, respectively, and the commander was in a turret basket up and behind the main gun. As a result, each crew member was effectively isolated from one another with the gunner and loader separated by Shillelagh missiles in their storage position. The commander was in the rear compartment under a large redesigned cupola, which somewhat negated the low profile silhouette of the turret.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The M162 gun was fully stabilized in both turret traverse and gun elevation using the same upgrade kit as the M60A1 AOS. This system could be used by the gunner to engage targets with unguided M409 rounds while the vehicle was in motion, but the tank had to remain stationary when firing and tracking an MGM-51 missile.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The turret interior also received Kevlar spall liners. Four M226 smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret bustle.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Additionally  there was a mounting point to the left of the turret for an AN/VSS-1(V)1 Infrared Spotlight and M19E1 IR periscope providing [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] for night operations. A basket was fitted to the rear of the turret to stow the spotlight when not in use. Late production versions replaced the bore evacuator with the Closed-Bore Scavenger System (CBSS), a compressed air system that pushed the fumes and gasses out of the muzzle when the breach was opened.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Initial production M60A2s used the M60A1 hull powered by an AVDS-1790-2A TLAC engine, CD-850-5 cross-drive transmission and the T97 track assembly. Many of these hulls were later upgraded to the RISE standard.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/>\n\nThe M51 Missile Guidance System (MGS) for the Shillelagh missiles was designed by [[Ford Aerospace|Ford's Aerospace Division]].

After acquiring a target a small charge would propel the missile out of the barrel, the missile's solid-fueled sustainer rocket then ignited and launched the Shillelagh. For the time of flight of the missile, the gunner had to keep the cross-hairs pointed at the target. A direct infrared beam  missile tracker in the gunner's sight detected any deviation of the flight path from the line-of-sight to the target, and transmitted corrective commands to the missile via an infrared command link. The MGM-51A was stabilized by flip-out fins, and controlled by hot gas jet reaction controls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html|title=Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh|website=www.designation-systems.net}}</ref> The gunner also employed an [[M73 Machine gun|M73]] (later replaced with a [[M240 machine gun|M240C]]) to the gun mantle's right with 2,000 rounds.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume</ref> The commanders cupola was redesigned causing the [[M85 machine gun|M85]] to be mounted in the inverted position in order to provide access to its feed cover and mounted a single M34 periscope carrying 600 rounds.<ref name=\"auto5\">Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 2</ref> The M60A2's combat load for the M162 main gun consisted of 33 M409 rounds and 13 [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missiles.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/>\n\n;Flaws\nThis weapon system had several drawbacks. First the gunner had to keep the target in the crosshairs of the sight during the entire flight time of the missile.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109174232/https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |archive-date=2019-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> This meant that only one target could be tracked and engaged at a time. Furthermore, the M60A2 could not fire or track a missile while moving.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Secondly was the high minimum range of about 730&nbsp;m (2,400&nbsp;ft). Until the missile reached this range it flew beneath the tracking system's infrared beam and could therefore not be guided by the infrared command link. Also minimum range was slightly above the maximum effective range of the M60A2's conventional unguided munition, this created a dangerous gap area that could not be adequately covered by fire known as a \"dead zone\". It was also discovered that structural cracks in the barrel occurred after several missile firings. This defect was traced to a flaw in the longitudinal key, which fitted into a keyway inside the gun barrel. It was determined that a less deep key would significantly extend the service life of the barrel. The Missile Control System was also very fragile owing to its dependence on vacuum tubes which often broke when firing the gun.  Finally a Shillelagh missile was considerably more expensive than the M409 round. The vehicle was one of the most technologically complex of its era, eventually garnering an unofficial nickname of \"Starship\".<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> This also contributed to its failure, largely due to difficulties with maintenance, training, and complicated operation.\n\nThe M60A2 proved a disappointment, though its technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. Its intended successor, the [[MBT-70]], was canceled in 1971 and its funding diverted into the [[History of the M1 Abrams#Development|conceptual development of the XM1 Abrams]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title = MBT-70 / Xm803}}</ref> The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped.

M60 series tanks were phased out of US service by 1997 and [[Opposing Force|OPFOR(S)]] training use in 2005. Together with the large number of M60MBTs still in foreign service and a large US Army surplus inventory, several upgrades for the tank were offered starting in 1985. There are three basic approaches to upgrade decisions for the M60MBT. Some countries, such as Taiwan and Jordan, have sought to modernize the M60 as a frontline main battle tank. Turkey is seeking a middle-ground, keeping it useful as it develops more modern designs. Other countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are modernizing their M60 fleets for counterinsurgency-type operations. While the market for M60 modernization is somewhat limited, because the tank is generally operated by poorer countries or has been relegated to secondary tasks, other companies have come up with more advanced upgrade solutions. Additionally, several countries also funded their own design upgrades, notable examples are the [[Magach]], [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] and Phoenix variants. In 2005, M60 variants were in service with [[Military of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Military of Greece|Greece]], [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel]], [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordan]], [[Turkish Army|Turkey]], [[Republic of China Army|Taiwan]] and some 20 other nations to varying degrees.\n\n====Super M60/AX====\n[[File:Super-m60.jpg|thumb|right|General Dynamics Super M60/AX prototype, 1985]]The Super M60/AX, also called ''Super 60'', was a comprehensive update package for the M60A1 and A3 tanks, first offered in 1985 by General Dynamics. The vehicle was developed as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. The upgrade offered to increase the protection, firepower and mobility for the M60A1 and A3 tanks.\n\nAlthough the US Army chose not to pursue the installation of a new power pack or suspension system in the M60 series, General Dynamics formed a co-operative private venture with Telledyne Continental to develop an upgrade. The new engine and suspension not only smoothen the off-road ride, but also allowed the M60/AX to handle well in spite of its considerable weight increase over the original M60A1. After initial tests, additional modifications were applied, featuring an armor upgrade intended to increase protection from shaped charged projectiles.<ref>http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm</ref> It was referred to as the Super 60 Program.\n\nThe tank upgrade is based on the M60A1 RISE hull and the T95E7 turret as used on the M60A1 and A3 variants of the M60 series. Mobility was increased by 20% with a new engine and transmission. It featured the AVCR-1790-1B engine coupled to a Renk RK-304 transmission with 4 forward and 4 reverse gears. The torsion bar suspension system of the M60 was replaced with the National Waterlift hydropneumatic suspension system (HSS).{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|pages=  }} Survivability was enhanced with a layer of Chobham spaced [[Vehicle armour#Appliqu\u00e9|applique armor]] built around the M60A1 turret, that noticeably changed its appearance. The hull armor is enhanced with a layer of laminated [[Vehicle armour#Steel|steel armor panels]] covering the frontal arc of the hull. A pair of steel track skirts were added as well as Kevlar spall liners for the fighting compartment. It has a crew of 4, the commander, loader and gunner are positioned in the turret and the driver in the front of the hull.\n[[File:Magach-7-latrun-2.jpg|left|thumb|Magach 7C in Yad la-Shiryon museum, Latrun.]]\nThe weapons of the M60/AX are similar to those of the M60A3, but different models were used. The main gun is the rifled 105&nbsp;mm/L55 M68A1E2 with a longer XM24 tube and a thermal sleeve, the same weapon used on the M1 and M1IP versions of the [[M1 Abrams]] MBT with 43 rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanknutdave.com/the-us-super-m60-tank-upgrade-package/|title=The US Super M60 Tank Upgrade Package}}</ref>  The 7.62&nbsp;mm M73 coaxial machine gun used on the M60A1 is replaced with a 7.62&nbsp;mm M240C, with the same number of rounds. The M19 cupola was replaced with a low silhouette model with a pop-up hatch for the commander and a 12.7&nbsp;mm [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] machine gun on a pintle mount with 600 rounds. The Fire Control System (FCS) is essentially the same as used on the M60A3TTS consisting of an M21E1 solid-state ballistic computer, Raytheon AN/VSG2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS) for the gunner, a Raytheon AN/VVS2 flash-lamp pumped ruby-laser based range finder, accurate up to 5000 meters, an M10A2E3 electro-mechanical ballistic drive and solid-state analog data card bus.  The [[prototype]] built did not have an optical range finder but one could have been easily installed.\n\nAs one of the first upgrade packages offered for the M60 series, the M60/AX prototype demonstrated the potential for upgrading the M60A1/A3 and even the M48 series as well. Even though this update package offered M60 users an opportunity to dramatically increase the combat capabilities of their tank fleets, no country ever bought the update, and the program effectively ceased by the end of the [[Cold War]]. Only one [[prototype]] was built. The overall failure of the Super 60 Program was likely due to the lack of immediate necessity for such a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |title=Super M60 Prototype Main Battle Tank |website=Military-today.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520231703/http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |archive-date=2019-05-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This design was also developed independently by Israel in their [[Magach#Versions|Magach 7]] series.\n\n====M60-2000 Main Battle Tank====\n{{main|M60-2000 Main Battle Tank}}\n[[File:M60-1220S.png|thumb|right|M60-120S]]\nThe [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] (GDLS) M60-2000 or 120S was an upgrade of the M60A1 tank. The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to the large number of M60 Main Battle Tanks in service with many Middle Eastern nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. The M60-2000/120S was a GDLS supplied conversion kit that married the M1A1 turret of the [[M1 Abrams]] to the M60A1 RISE hull, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.\n\nIt was first referred to the M60-2000 Program and design work began in late 1999 by General Dynamics Land Systems as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Later the M60 designation was dropped because of the extensive changes and to highlight this as a new vehicle to potential customers thus changing the name to the 120S Project. The M60-2000 was test-marketed during 2000 and a number of countries in NATO and the Middle East were briefed on the vehicle. Following customer feedback, detailed engineering work was carried out and in December GDLS decided to build a functional prototype.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m60-2000.htm |title = M60-2000 / 120S Main Battle Tank}}</ref> In August 2001 the company rolled out the fully functional prototype of the 120S MBT at their Detroit, Michigan, facility. The prototype was shown at the IDEF Exhibition held in Turkey in October 2001.\n\nThe 120S was initially aimed at the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) M60 upgrade requirement but this competition was subsequently won by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI Military Industries]] with their [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra II]] upgrade. The [[Egyptian Army]] was considering this offer until it was finally rejected in favor of a licensed contract to build M1s in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/egypt-co-production-m1a1-abrams-tank |title = Egypt - Co-production of M1A1 Abrams Tank &#124; the Official Home of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency}}</ref> Only one prototype was made.

They were replaced in National Guard service by the M1IP version of the Abrams MBT.\n\nDue to the end of the Cold War, surplus US Army M1A1s were absorbed by the US Marines replacing their M60A1s on a one for one basis, allowing the Marine Corps to quickly become an all-M1 tank force at reduced cost. Except for a small number in [[TRADOC]] service for the combat training of units in Europe, most M60s were placed in reserve. Some 1,400 were transferred to NATO allies from 1991 to 1993 under the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] and some were sold, mainly to Middle Eastern countries. They were finally declared as excess to US needs in 1994. They were given to a few nations under governmental grants.\n\nAfter being retired from combat use in 1991, 18 M60A3s, with the M19 cupola removed, continued in active Army service to provide tactical combat training to US and [[NATO]] forces in Europe. They were fitted with the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System]] (MILES), given the mission to provide tactical engagement simulation for direct fire force-on-force training and were maintained at the [[U.S. Army Garrison Bavaria|Combat Maneuver Training Center]] (CMTC) near [[Hohenfels, Bavaria|Hohenfels]], Germany.

In 1982 the Israelis once again used the M60 during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], equipped with upgrades such as [[explosive reactive armor]] to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks. The M60 also saw use in 1983 with [[United States invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault into Grenada. M60s delivered to Iran also served in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The United States' largest deployment of M60s was in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where the US Marines equipped with M60A1s effectively defeated Iraqi armored forces, including [[T-72|T-72M]] tanks. The United States readily retired the M60 after Operation Desert Storm, with the last units being retired from active service in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=28|title=M60 (Patton) Main Battle Tank (MBT) - United States|website=www.militaryfactory.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> M60-series vehicles continue in front-line service with a number of countries' militaries, though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield.\n\nThe M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle's service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the US and its Cold War allies, especially those in [[NATO]], and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the [[M1 Abrams]] in the US military. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles, bridge layers and combat engineering vehicles. As of 2015 [[Egypt]] is the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, [[Turkey]] is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and [[Saudi Arabia]] is third with over 650 units.\n\n==Development==\n===Impetus===\nThe United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the [[Korean War]], when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\">https://www.benning.army.mil/Armor/Historian/content/PDF/Armor%20Dev%20Cold%20War.pdf</ref> Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\"/>\n\nThe [[M47 Patton]] entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. The [[M48 Patton]] tank entered US service in 1952 but its early designs were deemed unsatisfactory by Army Field Forces (AFF). The improvements to the M48 focused on improving the 90mm main gun and fire control systems while simultaneously exploring the development of silicas glass composite armor and autoloader systems. The tank continued further development through 1955 in conjunction with its simultaneous mass production. The course of its development during the mid 1950s was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees.\n\nThe [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 program]], which began in 1955 was intended to supersede the M48. It featured a host of innovative and experimental components such as its 90&nbsp;mm smoothbore T208 cannon rigidly affixed to its turret, experimental X-shaped engine design, composite armor and infrared rangefinder. The burden of developing them, however, slowed the overall program to a crawl. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |title=The Beast of Budapest |website=HistoryNet.com |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921230135/http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |archive-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> After a brief examination of this tank's armor by a British military attach\u00e9 it was concluded that the [[Ordnance QF 20-pounder|20-pounder (84mm L/66.7)]] was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor with HEAT or APC ammunition. Its 100mm main gun was a significant advancement over the weapon of the [[T-44]]. Also there were rumors of an even larger 115mm gun in the works. These events spurred the [[United Kingdom]] to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the [[Royal Ordnance L7]] to keep the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] viable against this new Soviet tank design and the [[United States]] to develop the XM60 tank in 1957.<ref name=Halberstadt>{{Cite book |last=Halberstadt |first=Hans |title=Inside the Great Tanks |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Wiltshire, England |year=1997 |pages=94\u201396 |isbn=1-86126-270-1 |oclc=40989477 |quote=The T-54/T-55 series is the hands down, all time most popular tank in history.}}</ref> This new tank design incorporated many Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committee improvements to the M48, chiefly the use of diesel engines to increase its operational range and the use of a more powerful main gun.\n\n===Choice of components===\n\n====M68 105 mm Main Gun====\nThe main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nAn M48A2C was fit with the 90&nbsp;mm M41 and tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round. A smoothbore version of the 90&nbsp;mm, the T208E9, was mounted on the T95E1 tank and tested the T320E62 APDS round. An American version of the British L7 105&nbsp;mm gun, under the name [[Royal Ordnance L7#United States|105&nbsp;mm T254E1]], was mounted on the T95E2 and tested with British APDS ammunition. Finally, two versions of the 120&nbsp;mm gun from the M103 were trialed, the existing M58 model and a lightened variant known as T123E6 which was mounted on the T95E4.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }}\n\nThe T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=153 }} The ammunition was in two parts, shell and propellant bag, which required significant time to load. In the M103 this was addressed by adding a second loader, but a medium tank would not have the internal space needed for another crewmember and the firing rate would suffer as a result. In testing it demonstrated a maximum rate  of 4 rounds per minute vs. the T254's 7 rpm.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nBased on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the [[Royal Ordnance L7|Cannon, 105mm Gun, M68]].

The M60 hull had a straight slope and beak compared to the earlier M48's rounded one.

The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.

The T95E5 turret used on the M60 was hemispherically shaped and bore a strong resemblance to the M48 Patton. The M60A1 was the first version to employ the newly designed T95E7 turret with a redesigned bustle increasing the number of rounds for the main gun to 63. The M60A2 featured a specially designed turret for the M162 gun/missile launcher that greatly reduced the frontal arc in comparison to the M60A1's T95E7 turret.  The M60A3's turret was similar to the A1's but with increased armor protection for the frontal arc and mantlet in an effort to provide additional protection of the turret's hydraulics system.\n\n====M19 Commander's Cupola====\nA redesigned full vision cupola was envisioned for the commander's station. It had 7 tiltable vision blocks arranged to give the commander a 360 degree field of view with overlapping vision between adjacent vision blocks. The front vision block could be replaced with a dual power M34 7x50 binocular day sight or an M19E1 IR periscope. A special feature was that the cupola body could be raised up to 3 1/2 inches providing the commander a direct field of vision while remaining under armor protection. Access was through a hatch cover on the roof and a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun was pedestal mounted on the forward part of the cupola. It could be aimed and fired with the cupola closed. Also there was an 11 inch long hydraulically operated port on the left side allowing spent cartridge cases to be ejected.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} After creating a full-sized mock up of this design using the [[T95 Medium Tank#Versions and modifications|T95E6 turret]], it was dropped in favor of a design based on the M1 cupola of the M48A2's turret. This T9 cupola provided the commander with more headroom than the T6 cupola of the T95 tank, carrying a new [[Receiver (firearms)|short receiver]] M85/T175 .50 caliber machine gun{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} and it was standardized as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun,<ref name=\"Direct Support 1975\" /> M19. The first M19 cupola (a modified T9) was ready on 27 October 1958. It has an M28C sight for the machine gun in the forward part of the cupola and eight vision blocks. The front vision block can be replaced by a M19E1 infrared periscope or an M36E1 passive periscope for night observation.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html |title = M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)}}</ref> Initial production of the cupola was problematic. The first 300 M60s produced were armed with a .50cal M2HB machine gun in a pedestal mount welded to the left side of the commander's cupola owing to production problems with the new M85 machine gun. Of these tanks, the first 45 manufactured were made without the cupola itself, also due to production problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Crismon, Fred W. U.S. Military Tracked Vehicles.

Removing the cupola lowered the vehicle's relatively high silhouette. The cupola's hatch also opened toward the rear of the vehicle and was dangerous to close if under small-arms fire owing to a lock-open mechanism that required the user to apply leverage to unlock it prior to closing. The commander was able to observe the battlefield using the binocular M34 vision block or M19E1 IR Periscope while remaining under armor protection with a 360 degree traverse independent of the turret,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |title=M60A3 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203428/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |archive-date=2018-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> was stabilized in azimuth and elevation<ref name=\"50megs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|title=105mm Gun Tank M60|website=afvdb.50megs.com|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528154422/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and carried 600 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |title=M60 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426112135/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |archive-date=2019-04-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> All M60s in US service retained the M19 cupola until the tank was phased out of service. The few M60A3s in Army service as training vehicles had their commander's cupola removed as it was deemed unnecessary for training and to better mimic the profile of Soviet tanks.\n\n====Main Battle Tank Designation====\nThe concept of the [[medium tank]] gradually evolved into the [[Main Battle Tank]] (MBT) in the 1960s. The MBT was to combine the firepower and protection sufficient for the assault role with the mobility to perform as a medium tank.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The main battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the \"universal tank\", exemplified by the [[Centurion (tank)|British Centurion]], filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical main battle tanks were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Yet they were cheap enough to be built in large numbers. The first generation consists of the medium tanks designed and produced directly after World War II that were later redefined as main battle tanks. These were exemplified by the [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]]s armed with  a 90mm main gun already in widespread US service. The original variant of the M60 series also fulfilled the definition of a late first generation MBT sometimes being referred to as an intermediate second generation design. The Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54 and T-55]] as well as the original configuration of the [[T-62|T-62A]] tank designs are also regarded as first generation MBTs. The second generation had enhanced night-fighting capabilities and in most cases NBC protection. Most western tanks of this generation were armed with the 105&nbsp;mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun or derivatives of it. Notable are the [[Chieftain (tank)|British Chieftain]] and [[Leopard 1|German Leopard 1]]. The United States fully committed to the main battle tank doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps deactivated its last [[M103 (heavy tank)|M103 Heavy Tank]] battalion.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|page= 327 }} The first American nomenclature-designated second generation MBT was the M60A1 version of the M60 series. The term MBT is used in strategic doctrine and the composition of force as determined by the United States Army. The M60 series tanks fulfilled the MBT role on a strategic and tactical level. It was never referred to as such in any official training or technical manuals. The first Soviet second generation main battle tank designs were the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]].<ref>\u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-62. \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0443\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. 1968</ref>\n\n===Production Versions===\n\n===XM60 Development===\nBy May 1957 it became clear that the [[T95 Medium Tank]] would not have a significant advantage over the [[M48A2]]. The X-shaped motor and electro-optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the T95 project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The course of the M48 Patton's tank production was the source of widespread Congressional debate. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2. Correctly predicting that Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and the AVDS-1790 engine. Since the main gun had not yet been specified, four XM60 weapons systems were submitted in September 1957.\n\n[[File:XM60 120 big.png|thumb|left|Concept design #1 of the XM60 mounting the T123E6 main gun and British styled gun barrel, the newly designed full-vision cupola using the T95E6 turret as preferred by the Ordnance Department.]] \nThe first concept was armed with the 120mm gun T123E6 in the long nosed T95E6 turret. This was the design preferred by the Ordnance Department. It was fitted with a newly designed full-vision commander's cupola. A full sized mock-up of this turret was constructed before this concept was dropped, mainly due to its slow rate of fire. The second carried the 105mm rifled T254E2 main gun in the T95E5 type turret and the T9 cupola style of the M48A2. The T254 guns used British X15/L52 barrels with a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 62 }} The Army Ordnance Technical Committee chose this design for production in August 1958. The third concept was to mount the 90mm T208 smooth-bore main gun and the T95E6 turret. It never progressed beyond design drawings. The fourth used the T95E1 turret and the T208 main gun. A mock-up was built using the new vision cupola. All of these conceptual designs were referred to as the XM60. A contract was awarded to Chrysler Engineering in September 1958 for the advanced production engineering (APE) of the XM60 concept #2.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }} The T95 hull was considered however its one-piece front casting was too difficult and expensive to produce in quantity. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototyping of the [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].<ref>Tank Data, vol. 3. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: US Army Ordnance School, Jul 1968.</ref> Instead the decision was made to use modified M48A2 hulls. The hulls had 3 return rollers and 6 steel roadwheel pairs per side with no shock absorbers, using only bumper springs on the first and sixth roadwheel arms, along with a widened turret well and ring, and a flat wedge-shaped glacis. The T254E2 gun was chosen to be the main weapon of the tank in August 1958 being standardized as the M68 105mm gun. After a briefing on 11 December 1958, [[Maxwell D. Taylor|General Maxwell Taylor]] ordered the XM60 into production because of the improvements it offered in firepower, protection, and cruising range.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }}  Since the tank had not yet received its official designation these prototype hulls were briefly referred to as the M68 in December 1958 until they were officially named the M60 in March 1959.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\" /> Fulfilling this requirement was an interim tank design that resulted in the M60-series,{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} which largely resembles the M48 it was based on, but has significant differences.\n\n===M60===\n[[File:M60 Pilot 1.jpg|thumb|M60 production pilot number 1 after completion by Chrysler on 2 July 1959.

In August 1959, an engineering bid package was awarded for the second low rate production buy of M60s to be built at the Delaware Plant. Production pilot 3 was completed 2 September and went to the Detroit Arsenal Test Center for maintenance evaluations, it was then sent to Fort Knox for user trials.

The M60 mounted a 105&nbsp;mm M68 main gun with the [[bore evacuator]] mounted towards the middle of the tube carrying 57 rounds in the clamshell shaped turret style of the M48.

The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIn late 1962 a kit was fielded that allowed the use of the AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight. The searchlight has both infrared and visible light capabilities and was positioned over the gun. Along with an M32 IR periscope for the gunner, M19 IR periscope and M18 IR binoculars for the commander provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] capability to the M60 and M60A1 tanks. This kit was also compatible with the M48A5.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 166\u2013167 }}\n\nThe hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms with cast aluminum roadwheels and return rollers along with a single shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. Cast aluminum road wheels were used to save weight. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.  Power was provided by the AVDS-1790-2A engine, CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and the T97E2 track assembly as used on the M48A3.<ref>afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m48patton.html</ref> The drive sprocket is located at the rear of the hull. The vehicle also provides full NBC protection for the crew using the M13A1 protection system creating a positive atmospheric pressure in the crew compartment. The positive pressure keeps contaminated air out and forces the smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. Access between the driver's compartment and the turret fighting compartment was also restricted, requiring that the turret be traversed to the rear.\n\nThe M60 was deployed to [[West Germany]] to counter the threat presented from the [[T-54]]s and [[T-55]]s of the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] as well as to South Korea but was never sent to [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] mainly due to unfavorable terrain and the general lack of significant numbers of North Vietnamese armor.

In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. As the major changes were incorporated into the production line, the vehicle model designations were changed. The first of which was Top Loading Air Cleaner (TLAC) in 1971. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life as well as easier servicing of the engine.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} Early TLAC panels were made from aluminum and were vulnerable to damage from small arms fire.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> Next came Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner's aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a back up power mode. The manual back up system permits the crew to aim and fire the weapons should the electrical/hydraulical subsystems fail.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> At a range of 2000 meters, hit probabilities of better than 70% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1s with this upgrade were denoted as the M60A1(AOS). The T142 track was fielded in 1974 which had replaceable rubber pads, better end connecters and improved service life.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} M60A1(AOS)+ was the denotation for M60A1s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the T142 track.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIntroduced in 1975 the Reliability Improved Selected Equipment (RISE) was a comprehensive upgrade of the M60A1 hull as well as integrating the previous TLAC and AOS upgrades. It included the upgraded [[Continental AV1790|AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine]] and CD-850-6 transmission that featured several changes in order to improve service life and reliability. A new 650 ampere oil cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnectors was also incorporated into the hull's electrical system{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} as well as armored steel TLAC panels and the return to the use of steel roadwheels and return rollers. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE).<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> The 1977 fielding of the passive M32E1 sight for the gunner and M36E1 periscope for the commander as well as the M24E1 IR night vision block for the driver provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 2 (GEN II)|second generation night vision]] capabilities for M60A1 and RISE tanks. These new passive gunner's sight and commander's periscope provide recognition capability at longer ranges and at relatively low night light levels (1/2 moonlight). Under starlight conditions, they will provide recognition beyond 500 meters with the use of an IR searchlight.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> During 1978 a kit for the mounting of the M240 as the coaxial machine gun was fielded.  The development of the M735 [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot|APFSDS]] ammunition required a cam update to the gun's mechanical ballistic drive for accurate firing. M60A1s configured to this standard were denoted as M60A1(RISE)+.\n[[File:US Army M551 Sheridan German village.jpg|thumb|A US Army M60A1 RISE Passive tank maneuvers through a narrow German village street while participating in [[Exercise REFORGER|REFORGER]] 1982.]]\nThe M60A1(RISE) Passive featured the implementation of all previous updates plus Kevlar spall liners for the turret, AN/VVS-2 passive night vision block for the driver, a deep water fording kit, the capability to mount Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA){{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 202 }}{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 56 }} and the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine with CD-850-6A transmission and a Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS) that visually obscured the area around the vehicle.

The two six-barreled, electronically fired M239 smoke grenade launchers, one on each side of the main gun and replacement of the coax machine gun with the M240C were implemented in late 1978. The smoke grenades contains a phosphors compound that masks the thermal signature of the vehicle to the enemy.  They were denoted as M60A1(RISE) Passive.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nOver the period of M60A1 tank production several essential engineering changes were incorporated. Many of these miscellaneous changes are to improve the system safety, reliability, maintainability and increase mission performance. The M60A1 tank Hull/Turret PIP Update Kit includes those items that could not be readily identified with basic major product improvements and to incorporate essential engineering changes that had occurred during M60A1 tank production. The update program included engineering changes and minor product improvements which were not part of specific product improvements, but were required to upgrade early vintage M60A1 tanks up to the current M60A1(RISE) Passive production configuration.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nThe M60A1 was in production from October 1962 until May 1980<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> and was extensively used by the US Army and Marine Corps as well as being widely exported to foreign governments. A total of 7,948 M60A1s (all variants including E60A) were built.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 327 }} Many of them were later converted to the A3 standard.\n\n===M60A2{{anchor|M60A2}}===\nDuring the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between 1800 and 2000 meters. The XM-13/MGM-51 missile system had proven itself viable, obtaining over 90% first round accuracy up to 4000 meters. But the development of a main-battle tank variant was bogged down by having too many design proposals. In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds and launching ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided-Missiles).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/|title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship'|date=7 July 2017|website=Tank Encyclopedia}}</ref> Three M60E1 tanks with T95 turrets were modified to permit the installation of the 152mm XM81 gun-launcher. Mounted on former M60 hulls, they were to provide test beds for the evaluation of the Shillelagh weapon system. Although this system was the preferred armament for the MBT-70, by late 1961 problems with the XM13 missile required that the program be reorganized. The missile was reclassified as an applied research project and it was obvious that there would be some delay before it would be available for service.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 627 }} On 10 January 1962, representatives from various ordnance organizations met at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Center (OTAC) to review armament systems that might be suitable replacements, if the Shillelagh missile could not be developed in a timely manner. Time was particularly critical for the AR/AAV (the XM551 Sheridan) which required a decision on the armament by April 1962. The possible delay was not as serious for the MBT-70 since the program was limited to conceptual design and component development. The requirements also differed for the tank because of its ability to carry a much heavier weapon system. Several backup weapons were also under consideration and concept studies were prepared showing their application to the MBT-70 concepts. The 152mm gun-launcher XM81 also was considered without the missile depending only on the combustible case conventional ammunition. It was expected that the Shillelagh or some other missile then could be introduced at a later date. The 105mm gun M68 as standardized for the M60 tank was considered as an alternate armament system. It had the advantage of being immediately available and its ammunition was already in production. Of the several turrets drafted, one of the earliest was the driver-in-turret integrated fighting compartment. This design was further developed using the [[MBT-70]]. Another proposal was a more compact turret design of the T95E7.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 pp.631-633</ref>\n\n;Development\n[[File:XM66 Type C design concept.png|thumb|Conceptual drawing of the XM66 with Type C turret]]\nDuring the development of the M60A2, three different turret types were considered, the Type A, Type B and Type C. The Type A turret would be constructed based on the T95E7 turret and then further modified and produced as the Type B standard. The Type C turret was essentially a larger [[M551 Sheridan]]-style turret. A mock-up of this turret was built, but the design was never seriously considered and soon abandoned. All of these conceptual variants were referred to as the XM66. On 10 January 1964, the Army reviewed all three variants and selected the Type A variant for further development. Initially two Type A turrets were built in 1964.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 138 }} The M60A1 hull was used starting in 1966 to develop the new compact turret design using the 152mm M162/XM81E13 rifled barrel main gun. These developmental tanks were designated as the M60A1E series.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 141 }}\n\nThe M60A1E1 referred to vehicles based on the modified T95E7 Type A turrets with M60 hulls used through 1965. The M60A1E1 variant was used to evaluate the M162/XM81E13 gun on different mounts and compatibility with the XM13 Guided Missile, Armor Defeating together with the XMTM51 training round. They used a modified M60A1/T95E7 turret. During the early testing of the M162/XM81E13 main gun it was noted that misfires and premature detonations of the M409 conventional case ammunition were caused by unburnt propellant in the bore and breech. This flaw was often catastrophic as it set off the projectile in the barrel as it was fired.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship' |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085943/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> To remedy this the guns were equipped with a traditional fume extractor on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= }} The XM81E13 Gun/Launcher also experienced frequent faulty breaches, often not closing correctly during a missile firing, allowing the exhaust of the launching Shillelagh to vent hot noxious gasses into the crew compartment.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> [[File:M60A1E1 Tank.jpg|thumb|left|M60A1E2 tank prototype with Type B turret.]] As the M60A1 hull became available in 1966, it was decided to upgrade these prototype vehicles to the M60A1 standard. Vehicles using the M60A1 hull and chassis received the M60A1E2 designation, and were used to develop the Type B compact turret.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 1/</ref> The M60A1E2 finalized the turret design with the use of a compact turret which reduced exposed frontal area by 40% compared to the M60A1 and continued development of the M51 Missile Guidance System (M51MGS).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> These were later standardized as the M60A2. Initial plans called to retrofit the turret of every M60 with the new A2 turret, and use them in the mobile anti-armor role  alongside the M60A1 tanks. But the continual technical and reliability difficulties with the dual purpose gun caused this to be abandoned. The M60A1E3 variant was a prototype mounting the M68 105&nbsp;mm rifled gun to the turret of the M60A1E2. This was evaluated due to several earlier faults noted in the M60A1E1's main gun. Compared to the Shillelagh system, the use of the 105mm gun increased the overall tank weight by about 1700 pounds.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1.

It consisted of a large disk with a narrow channel in the center with each crew member in the turret having their own hatch. The gunner and loader were located to the right and left of the gun, respectively, and the commander was in a turret basket up and behind the main gun. As a result, each crew member was effectively isolated from one another with the gunner and loader separated by Shillelagh missiles in their storage position. The commander was in the rear compartment under a large redesigned cupola, which somewhat negated the low profile silhouette of the turret.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The M162 gun was fully stabilized in both turret traverse and gun elevation using the same upgrade kit as the M60A1 AOS. This system could be used by the gunner to engage targets with unguided M409 rounds while the vehicle was in motion, but the tank had to remain stationary when firing and tracking an MGM-51 missile.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The turret interior also received Kevlar spall liners. Four M226 smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret bustle.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Additionally  there was a mounting point to the left of the turret for an AN/VSS-1(V)1 Infrared Spotlight and M19E1 IR periscope providing [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] for night operations. A basket was fitted to the rear of the turret to stow the spotlight when not in use. Late production versions replaced the bore evacuator with the Closed-Bore Scavenger System (CBSS), a compressed air system that pushed the fumes and gasses out of the muzzle when the breach was opened.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Initial production M60A2s used the M60A1 hull powered by an AVDS-1790-2A TLAC engine, CD-850-5 cross-drive transmission and the T97 track assembly. Many of these hulls were later upgraded to the RISE standard.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/>\n\nThe M51 Missile Guidance System (MGS) for the Shillelagh missiles was designed by [[Ford Aerospace|Ford's Aerospace Division]]. The M51 MGS consisted of an infrared (IR) direct beam guidance and control system to track the missile mounted to the turret over the mantel of the gun<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html |title=Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh |website=designation-systems.net |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230072854/http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html |archive-date=2018-12-30 |url-status=live }}</ref> with a telescopic sight and a Raytheon AN/VVS1 Flashlamp Pumped, Ruby Laser range finder,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship' |date=7 July 2017 |website=Tank Encyclopedia |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085943/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>TM 9-2350-232-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual for Turret, Elevating and Traversing Systems,Cupola, Gun/Launcher, and Mount Used on Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked, 152-MM Gun/Launcher M60A2 (2350-00-930-3590) 15 Feb 75</ref> accurate to 4,000 meters,<ref name=\"usarmygermany.com\"/> for the gunner.\nThe gunner aimed the cross-hairs in his direct telescopic sight at the target and fired the missile. After acquiring a target a small charge would propel the missile out of the barrel, the missile's solid-fueled sustainer rocket then ignited and launched the Shillelagh. For the time of flight of the missile, the gunner had to keep the cross-hairs pointed at the target. A direct infrared beam  missile tracker in the gunner's sight detected any deviation of the flight path from the line-of-sight to the target, and transmitted corrective commands to the missile via an infrared command link. The MGM-51A was stabilized by flip-out fins, and controlled by hot gas jet reaction controls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html|title=Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh|website=www.designation-systems.net}}</ref> The gunner also employed an [[M73 Machine gun|M73]] (later replaced with a [[M240 machine gun|M240C]]) to the gun mantle's right with 2,000 rounds.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume</ref> The commanders cupola was redesigned causing the [[M85 machine gun|M85]] to be mounted in the inverted position in order to provide access to its feed cover and mounted a single M34 periscope carrying 600 rounds.<ref name=\"auto5\">Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 2</ref> The M60A2's combat load for the M162 main gun consisted of 33 M409 rounds and 13 [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missiles.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/>\n\n;Flaws\nThis weapon system had several drawbacks. First the gunner had to keep the target in the crosshairs of the sight during the entire flight time of the missile.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109174232/https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |archive-date=2019-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> This meant that only one target could be tracked and engaged at a time. Furthermore, the M60A2 could not fire or track a missile while moving.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Secondly was the high minimum range of about 730&nbsp;m (2,400&nbsp;ft). Until the missile reached this range it flew beneath the tracking system's infrared beam and could therefore not be guided by the infrared command link. Also minimum range was slightly above the maximum effective range of the M60A2's conventional unguided munition, this created a dangerous gap area that could not be adequately covered by fire known as a \"dead zone\". It was also discovered that structural cracks in the barrel occurred after several missile firings. This defect was traced to a flaw in the longitudinal key, which fitted into a keyway inside the gun barrel. It was determined that a less deep key would significantly extend the service life of the barrel. The Missile Control System was also very fragile owing to its dependence on vacuum tubes which often broke when firing the gun.  Finally a Shillelagh missile was considerably more expensive than the M409 round. The vehicle was one of the most technologically complex of its era, eventually garnering an unofficial nickname of \"Starship\".<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> This also contributed to its failure, largely due to difficulties with maintenance, training, and complicated operation.\n\nThe M60A2 proved a disappointment, though its technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. Its intended successor, the [[MBT-70]], was canceled in 1971 and its funding diverted into the [[History of the M1 Abrams#Development|conceptual development of the XM1 Abrams]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title = MBT-70 / Xm803}}</ref> The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped.

M60 series tanks were phased out of US service by 1997 and [[Opposing Force|OPFOR(S)]] training use in 2005. Together with the large number of M60MBTs still in foreign service and a large US Army surplus inventory, several upgrades for the tank were offered starting in 1985. There are three basic approaches to upgrade decisions for the M60MBT. Some countries, such as Taiwan and Jordan, have sought to modernize the M60 as a frontline main battle tank. Turkey is seeking a middle-ground, keeping it useful as it develops more modern designs. Other countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are modernizing their M60 fleets for counterinsurgency-type operations. While the market for M60 modernization is somewhat limited, because the tank is generally operated by poorer countries or has been relegated to secondary tasks, other companies have come up with more advanced upgrade solutions. Additionally, several countries also funded their own design upgrades, notable examples are the [[Magach]], [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] and Phoenix variants. In 2005, M60 variants were in service with [[Military of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Military of Greece|Greece]], [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel]], [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordan]], [[Turkish Army|Turkey]], [[Republic of China Army|Taiwan]] and some 20 other nations to varying degrees.\n\n====Super M60/AX====\n[[File:Super-m60.jpg|thumb|right|General Dynamics Super M60/AX prototype, 1985]]The Super M60/AX, also called ''Super 60'', was a comprehensive update package for the M60A1 and A3 tanks, first offered in 1985 by General Dynamics. The vehicle was developed as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. The upgrade offered to increase the protection, firepower and mobility for the M60A1 and A3 tanks.\n\nAlthough the US Army chose not to pursue the installation of a new power pack or suspension system in the M60 series, General Dynamics formed a co-operative private venture with Telledyne Continental to develop an upgrade. The new engine and suspension not only smoothen the off-road ride, but also allowed the M60/AX to handle well in spite of its considerable weight increase over the original M60A1. After initial tests, additional modifications were applied, featuring an armor upgrade intended to increase protection from shaped charged projectiles.<ref>http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm</ref> It was referred to as the Super 60 Program.\n\nThe tank upgrade is based on the M60A1 RISE hull and the T95E7 turret as used on the M60A1 and A3 variants of the M60 series. Mobility was increased by 20% with a new engine and transmission. It featured the AVCR-1790-1B engine coupled to a Renk RK-304 transmission with 4 forward and 4 reverse gears. The torsion bar suspension system of the M60 was replaced with the National Waterlift hydropneumatic suspension system (HSS).{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|pages=  }} Survivability was enhanced with a layer of Chobham spaced [[Vehicle armour#Appliqu\u00e9|applique armor]] built around the M60A1 turret, that noticeably changed its appearance.

A pair of steel track skirts were added as well as Kevlar spall liners for the fighting compartment. It has a crew of 4, the commander, loader and gunner are positioned in the turret and the driver in the front of the hull.\n[[File:Magach-7-latrun-2.jpg|left|thumb|Magach 7C in Yad la-Shiryon museum, Latrun.]]\nThe weapons of the M60/AX are similar to those of the M60A3, but different models were used. The main gun is the rifled 105&nbsp;mm/L55 M68A1E2 with a longer XM24 tube and a thermal sleeve, the same weapon used on the M1 and M1IP versions of the [[M1 Abrams]] MBT with 43 rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanknutdave.com/the-us-super-m60-tank-upgrade-package/|title=The US Super M60 Tank Upgrade Package}}</ref>  The 7.62&nbsp;mm M73 coaxial machine gun used on the M60A1 is replaced with a 7.62&nbsp;mm M240C, with the same number of rounds. The M19 cupola was replaced with a low silhouette model with a pop-up hatch for the commander and a 12.7&nbsp;mm [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] machine gun on a pintle mount with 600 rounds. The Fire Control System (FCS) is essentially the same as used on the M60A3TTS consisting of an M21E1 solid-state ballistic computer, Raytheon AN/VSG2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS) for the gunner, a Raytheon AN/VVS2 flash-lamp pumped ruby-laser based range finder, accurate up to 5000 meters, an M10A2E3 electro-mechanical ballistic drive and solid-state analog data card bus.  The [[prototype]] built did not have an optical range finder but one could have been easily installed.\n\nAs one of the first upgrade packages offered for the M60 series, the M60/AX prototype demonstrated the potential for upgrading the M60A1/A3 and even the M48 series as well. Even though this update package offered M60 users an opportunity to dramatically increase the combat capabilities of their tank fleets, no country ever bought the update, and the program effectively ceased by the end of the [[Cold War]]. Only one [[prototype]] was built. The overall failure of the Super 60 Program was likely due to the lack of immediate necessity for such a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |title=Super M60 Prototype Main Battle Tank |website=Military-today.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520231703/http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |archive-date=2019-05-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This design was also developed independently by Israel in their [[Magach#Versions|Magach 7]] series.\n\n====M60-2000 Main Battle Tank====\n{{main|M60-2000 Main Battle Tank}}\n[[File:M60-1220S.png|thumb|right|M60-120S]]\nThe [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] (GDLS) M60-2000 or 120S was an upgrade of the M60A1 tank. The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to the large number of M60 Main Battle Tanks in service with many Middle Eastern nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. The M60-2000/120S was a GDLS supplied conversion kit that married the M1A1 turret of the [[M1 Abrams]] to the M60A1 RISE hull, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.\n\nIt was first referred to the M60-2000 Program and design work began in late 1999 by General Dynamics Land Systems as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Later the M60 designation was dropped because of the extensive changes and to highlight this as a new vehicle to potential customers thus changing the name to the 120S Project. The M60-2000 was test-marketed during 2000 and a number of countries in NATO and the Middle East were briefed on the vehicle. Following customer feedback, detailed engineering work was carried out and in December GDLS decided to build a functional prototype.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m60-2000.htm |title = M60-2000 / 120S Main Battle Tank}}</ref> In August 2001 the company rolled out the fully functional prototype of the 120S MBT at their Detroit, Michigan, facility. The prototype was shown at the IDEF Exhibition held in Turkey in October 2001.\n\nThe 120S was initially aimed at the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) M60 upgrade requirement but this competition was subsequently won by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI Military Industries]] with their [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra II]] upgrade.
