M. Kaye]], published in 1978, which tells the story of an English officer during the [[British Raj]]. There are many parallels between this novel and [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' that was published in 1900: the settings, the young English boy raised as a native by an Indian surrogate mother, \"[[the Great Game]]\" as it was played by the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperial Russia]]. The novel, rooted deeply in the [[romantic epic]]s of the 19th century, has been hailed as a masterpiece of storytelling. It is based partly on biographical writings of the author's grandfather as well as her knowledge of and childhood experiences in India. It has sold millions of copies, caused travel agents to create tours that visited the locations in the book, and inspired a television adaptation and a musical play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-02-04-author-kaye-dies_x.htm |title='Far Pavilions' author M.M.

His mother dies from [[childbed fever]] shortly after his birth and his father dies of [[cholera]] a few years later. He is entrusted to his [[Hindu]] ''[[Amah (occupation)|ayah]]'' (nanny) Sita to be brought to his English relatives in the city of [[Mardan]]. After discovering that all English ''feringhis'' have been killed during the uprising, Sita adopts the dark-skinned Ash and takes him in search of safety.\n\nThey eventually find refuge in the kingdom of Gulkote where Ashton, now going by the name Ashok, forgets his English parentage and grows up as a native Indian boy. While working as a servant for Lalji, the young ''yuveraj'' (crown prince) of Gulkote, Ashton befriends the neglected princess Anjuli, in addition to the master of stables, Koda Dad, and his son Zarin. At the age of 11, Ashton uncovers a murderous conspiracy against Lalji and learns he himself will be killed for interfering with the plot. Promising Anjuli he will return for her one-day, he and Sita escape the palace with assistance from friends Sita and Ashok have made within the palace over the years, and flee from Gulkote. The ailing Sita dies en route, but not before revealing to Ash his true parentage and entrusting him with the letters and money his father gave her before his death.\n\nAshok makes his way to the military division Sita instructed him about, and they recognise him; now known by his English name, Ashton is turned over to English authorities and sent to England for a formal education and military training. At age 19, Ashton returns to India as an officer in the [[Corps of Guides (British India)|Corps of Guides]] with Zarin on the Northern Frontier. He quickly finds that his sense of place is torn between his new-found status as Ashton, an English \"[[sahib]]\", and Ashok, the native Indian boy he once believed he was.\n\nAfter going [[AWOL#Absence without leave|AWOL]] in Afghanistan (to restore the honour of his soldiers, penalized for losing weapons to border raiders) Ash is suspended from The Guides and sent to escort a royal wedding party across India. The party is in fact from the former kingdom of Gulkote, now known as Karidkote after merging with a neighbouring princedom, and Anjuli and her sister Shushila are the princesses to be married. Also in the wedding party is Anjuli's younger brother, the prince Jhoti. After revealing himself as Ashok to Anjuli, Ash falls in love with her, but is unable to act on his feelings as she is not only betrothed to another but belongs to what is now an alien culture, across a divide which they can no longer bridge. Over the months that follow, Ash thwarts a plot to murder Jhoti, and falls into increasing despair over his unrequited love for Anjuli. While caught in a dust-storm together, Anjuli reveals her love for Ash, but rebuffs his pleas to run away with him out of duty to her sister as a co-bride in an arranged marriage. Ash is forced to watch Anjuli be married off to the lecherous rana of Bhithor and return to his duties in the military.\n\nTwo years later, Ash receives distressing news that the ''[[rana (title)|rana]]'' of Bhithor is dying, and that his wives are to be burned alive in the Hindu ritual of ''[[Sati (practice)|suttee]]''. Racing to Bhithor, Ash and his friends manage to rescue Anjuli and take her to safety; this rescue results in the death of not only Ash's beloved horse but also most of the human members of the party. He insists upon marrying Anjuli, despite the insistence of all other members of his group of acquaintances, including Anjuli, that this is not only unnecessary but against God's Law.\n\nHere the book's focus shifts from the relationship between Ash and Anjuli to England's and Russia's political wrangling in the regions north of what were the Indian borders at the time. In England's desire to expand its territory into Afghanistan, Ash is sent into the country as a spy to relay information that will help England establish a permanent foothold in the area. What follows is an account of the first phase of the [[Second Afghan War]], culminating in the September 1879 uprising that killed the English envoy in [[Kabul]]. This part of the story is told mostly from the perspective of Ash's best friend Walter \"Wally\" Hamilton.\n\nAfter the uprising in Kabul, Ash and Anjuli set out in search of a paradise in the Himalayas \u2013 \"the far pavilions\" \u2013 free of prejudice where they can live out their lives in peace.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nOn November 5, 2019, the ''[[BBC News]]'' listed ''The Far Pavilions'' on its list of the [[BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels|100 most influential novels]].<ref name=Bbc2019-11-05/>\n\n==Characters in ''The Far Pavilions''==\n* Ashton Hillary Akbar (Ashok) Pelham-Martyn\n* Anjuli-Bai\n* Koda Dad Khan\n* Biju Ram\n* Mrs. Viccary\n* Shushila-Bai\n* Belinda Harlowe\n* Kaka-ji Rao\n* [[Walter Richard Pollock Hamilton|Walter Hamilton]]\n* Zarin Khan\n* Sita\n* Lalji\n* Captain Stiggins\n* Jhoti\n* [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Cavagnari]]\n* Wigram Battye\n\n==Film, TV and theatrical adaptations==\n===Miniseries===\nFor [[HBO]] and [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]], and first screened in 1984 in the UK, [[Peter Duffell]] directed a five-hour three-part television [[miniseries]] based on the novel, starring [[Ben Cross]] as Ashton, [[Amy Irving]] as Anjuli, [[Omar Sharif]] as Koda Dad and [[Christopher Lee]] as Kaka-ji Rao.

Ward, with music composed by Philip Henderson, premiered at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] on 14 April 2005 after two weeks of previews. Despite being booked until 14 January 2006 ''The Far Pavilions'' closed 17 September 2005 as per a 17 August 2005 announcement. The musical received mixed reviews, but its early closing was attributed to a steep drop in ticket sales subsequent to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7 London bombings]]. Budgeted at 7 million pounds, the musical's cast featured [[Hadley Fraser]] as Ashton, [[Simon Gleeson]] as Walter, [[Gayatri Iyer]] as Anjuli, [[Kulvinder Ghir]] as the Rana of Bhithor and [[Kabir Bedi]] as Kahn Sahib. While in India in March 2006 (to scatter M M Kaye's ashes over [[Lake Pichola]]) Michael E. Ward announced that he had written the script for a sequel to ''The Far Pavilions'' entitled ''Fireflies'' whose projected stage premiere would be in [[Mumbai]] in January 2007, with Ward hoping for a subsequent London stage engagement and a film version.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-the-sequel-to-far-pavilions-will-be-staged-in-mumbai-1016256| title=The sequel to Far Pavilions will be staged in Mumbai| publisher=Daily News and Analysis <sub>dnaindia.com</sub>| access-date=9 April 2016}}</ref> There are no evident subsequent reports of any progress in this projected sequel to ''The Far Pavilions''.\n\n''The Far Pavilions'' was adapted for [[radio drama]] on Britain's [[BBC Radio Four]].

Despite being booked until 14 January 2006 ''The Far Pavilions'' closed 17 September 2005 as per a 17 August 2005 announcement. The musical received mixed reviews, but its early closing was attributed to a steep drop in ticket sales subsequent to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7 London bombings]]. Budgeted at 7 million pounds, the musical's cast featured [[Hadley Fraser]] as Ashton, [[Simon Gleeson]] as Walter, [[Gayatri Iyer]] as Anjuli, [[Kulvinder Ghir]] as the Rana of Bhithor and [[Kabir Bedi]] as Kahn Sahib. While in India in March 2006 (to scatter M M Kaye's ashes over [[Lake Pichola]]) Michael E. Ward announced that he had written the script for a sequel to ''The Far Pavilions'' entitled ''Fireflies'' whose projected stage premiere would be in [[Mumbai]] in January 2007, with Ward hoping for a subsequent London stage engagement and a film version.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-the-sequel-to-far-pavilions-will-be-staged-in-mumbai-1016256| title=The sequel to Far Pavilions will be staged in Mumbai| publisher=Daily News and Analysis <sub>dnaindia.com</sub>| access-date=9 April 2016}}</ref> There are no evident subsequent reports of any progress in this projected sequel to ''The Far Pavilions''.\n\n''The Far Pavilions'' was adapted for [[radio drama]] on Britain's [[BBC Radio Four]].

The album features a broader spectrum of musical styles than the band's previous albums, ranging from some of their heaviest compositions to moody [[trip hop]] and [[shoegaze]] influences, with some songs recorded mostly with [[seven-string guitar]]s. It was the band's final album to be produced by [[Terry Date]], whose collaboration with Deftones dated back to their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' (1995).\n\n==Background==\nOriginally titled ''Lovers'', the album was instead given an eponymous title because singer [[Chino Moreno]] considered ''Lovers'' too obvious in relation to the context of its material (the former title song \"Lovers\" did appear as an [[A-side and B-side]] on the UK \"[[Hexagram (song)|Hexagram]]\" single). ''Deftones'' was the last album produced by Date, who had collaborated with the band since ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'', due to the vast amount of time spent in the studio. The band's slow writing and recording pace frustrated Date, as well as their lack of previously composed material when they entered the studio. A leaked track list from a month prior to the album's release featured \"Needles & Pins\" as the opener, under the title \"Aria\"; The song title and the album's track list were changed at the last minute.\n\n==Musical style==\n''Deftones'' is an eclectic album, with songs spanning many different ideas in diverse genres. It has a much different feel than prior efforts, due in part to [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] leaving his [[turntables]] behind and instead focusing on playing [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[synthesizer]]s. Most of the album's songs make extensive use of the band's low G# tuning and Moreno's high screams, resulting in some of the heaviest songs in the band's catalog. On the other hand, the track \"Lucky You\" is a dark, soft, [[trip hop]]-influenced piece featuring DJ Crook from Moreno's side project [[Team Sleep]] and vocalist [[Rey Osburn]] of [[Tinfed]]. A [[grand piano]] and [[toy piano]] were featured in the mournful \"Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event.\"\n\nIn addition to [[trip-hop]] influences, significant [[shoegaze]] elements have been noted on the album, especially in regards to the song \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]].\".<ref name=\"cos\">{{cite magazine | url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/the-top-20-deftones-songs/2/ | title=The Top 20 Deftones Songs | magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]] | accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"spinmag\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Andrew|title=The SPIN Interview: Deftones|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/spin-interview-deftones-gore-new-album/|website=SPIN|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite web|last1=Gormely|first1=Ian|title=Deftones: Beauty and Brutality|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/deftones-beauty_and_brutality|website=Exclaim!|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\n''Deftones'' produced two [[single (music)|singles]], \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]]\" and \"Hexagram.\" [[Music video]]s were shot for both singles as well as the track \"Bloody Cape\". The latter's video was only available on the band's official [[website]] for one day, but was later released on the DVD portion of the band's ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]''. As the [[lead single]], \"Minerva\" featured a melodic, commercially viable sound and gained strong rotation on mainstream rock video programming. In contrast, the extreme heaviness of \"Hexagram\" landed it on shows such as ''[[Uranium (TV series)|Uranium]]'' and ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.\n\n\"Battle-Axe\" was featured in the [[video game]] ''[[Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2]]'', while \"Minerva\" was featured in ''[[True Crime: Streets of LA]]'', [[NHL 2004]], ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]'', and also as downloadable content for the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| MC = 74/100<ref name=\"Summary\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/deftones/deftones |title=Deftones - Deftones Warner Brothers / Maverick Summary |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"auto\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r641315|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev3 = Dot Music\n|rev3Score = (8/10)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dotmusic.com/reviews/Albums/May2003/reviews29515.asp |title=Deftones Reviews |date=3 June 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030603224459/http://dotmusic.com/reviews/Albums/May2003/reviews29515.asp |archivedate=June 3, 2003 }}</ref>\n| rev4 =  [[E!|E!

The album features a broader spectrum of musical styles than the band's previous albums, ranging from some of their heaviest compositions to moody [[trip hop]] and [[shoegaze]] influences, with some songs recorded mostly with [[seven-string guitar]]s. It was the band's final album to be produced by [[Terry Date]], whose collaboration with Deftones dated back to their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' (1995).\n\n==Background==\nOriginally titled ''Lovers'', the album was instead given an eponymous title because singer [[Chino Moreno]] considered ''Lovers'' too obvious in relation to the context of its material (the former title song \"Lovers\" did appear as an [[A-side and B-side]] on the UK \"[[Hexagram (song)|Hexagram]]\" single). ''Deftones'' was the last album produced by Date, who had collaborated with the band since ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'', due to the vast amount of time spent in the studio. The band's slow writing and recording pace frustrated Date, as well as their lack of previously composed material when they entered the studio. A leaked track list from a month prior to the album's release featured \"Needles & Pins\" as the opener, under the title \"Aria\"; The song title and the album's track list were changed at the last minute.\n\n==Musical style==\n''Deftones'' is an eclectic album, with songs spanning many different ideas in diverse genres. It has a much different feel than prior efforts, due in part to [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] leaving his [[turntables]] behind and instead focusing on playing [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[synthesizer]]s. Most of the album's songs make extensive use of the band's low G# tuning and Moreno's high screams, resulting in some of the heaviest songs in the band's catalog. On the other hand, the track \"Lucky You\" is a dark, soft, [[trip hop]]-influenced piece featuring DJ Crook from Moreno's side project [[Team Sleep]] and vocalist [[Rey Osburn]] of [[Tinfed]]. A [[grand piano]] and [[toy piano]] were featured in the mournful \"Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event.\"\n\nIn addition to [[trip-hop]] influences, significant [[shoegaze]] elements have been noted on the album, especially in regards to the song \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]].\".<ref name=\"cos\">{{cite magazine | url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/the-top-20-deftones-songs/2/ | title=The Top 20 Deftones Songs | magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]] | accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"spinmag\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Andrew|title=The SPIN Interview: Deftones|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/spin-interview-deftones-gore-new-album/|website=SPIN|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite web|last1=Gormely|first1=Ian|title=Deftones: Beauty and Brutality|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/deftones-beauty_and_brutality|website=Exclaim!|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\n''Deftones'' produced two [[single (music)|singles]], \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]]\" and \"Hexagram.\" [[Music video]]s were shot for both singles as well as the track \"Bloody Cape\". The latter's video was only available on the band's official [[website]] for one day, but was later released on the DVD portion of the band's ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]''. As the [[lead single]], \"Minerva\" featured a melodic, commercially viable sound and gained strong rotation on mainstream rock video programming. In contrast, the extreme heaviness of \"Hexagram\" landed it on shows such as ''[[Uranium (TV series)|Uranium]]'' and ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.\n\n\"Battle-Axe\" was featured in the [[video game]] ''[[Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2]]'', while \"Minerva\" was featured in ''[[True Crime: Streets of LA]]'', [[NHL 2004]], ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]'', and also as downloadable content for the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| MC = 74/100<ref name=\"Summary\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/deftones/deftones |title=Deftones - Deftones Warner Brothers / Maverick Summary |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"auto\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r641315|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev3 = Dot Music\n|rev3Score = (8/10)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dotmusic.com/reviews/Albums/May2003/reviews29515.asp |title=Deftones Reviews |date=3 June 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030603224459/http://dotmusic.com/reviews/Albums/May2003/reviews29515.asp |archivedate=June 3, 2003 }}</ref>\n| rev4 =  [[E!|E!
