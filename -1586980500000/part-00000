Along with low wages, some employers outright refused to pay wages and were dishonest with wages or deprived workers of wages for a lengthened time. These deprived and frustrated workers then used \u201cpan-toting\u201d as a counter-tactic. The \"pan-toting\" strategy was essential for making ends meet and asserting their new-found freedom. Household laborers expected employees to acknowledge their duty to ensure basic needs by supplementing wages with leftover food, or they would reclaim the fruits of their labor without the employers\u2019 consent.<ref name=Hunter-60-61>Hunter, pp. 60-61.</ref> This was an expectation from the worker because of their low wages. Employers were expected to recognize their obligation to this practice and ensure workers receive basic provisions from leftover food. If the employer did not recognize this, some workers would leave without consent. Some employers admitted to the practice, openly admitting that they paid low wages with table scraps in mind. Other employers interpreted \u201cfree\u201d labor to mean expropriating labor without compensation'.<ref name=Hunter-61>Hunter, p. 61.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n\"Pan-Toting\" originated in [[slavery in the United States]] during the late nineteenth century, among the African-American population. This practice evolved during the transition from slave to free labor as an expression of a dissolving \u201cmoral economy\u201d. It is consistent with the \u201cvails\u201d and prerequisites claimed by servants across cultures and dating back centuries.<ref name=Hunter-61 /> It was African-American domestic workers that claimed the right to this form of compensation and privileges as workers in the new free labor market because of their former status as slaves and the unpaid work they carried out for their masters and the white community. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, African-American domestic workers continued to implement this practice. They continued to express their opposition to work conditions that deprived them of a decent standard of living by drawing on decades of experiences with creative resistance.<ref name=Hunter-227>Hunter, p. 227.</ref>\n\n== Dependence ==\nA lot of African-American workers and their families depended upon this form of payment as they were short for money. This left-over food was important to their survival. The \u201cservice pan\u201d augmented wages in almost two-thirds of the employers\u2019 households in Athens, Georgia, in 1913.<ref name=Sharpless-74>Sharpless, p. 74.</ref> A \u201c[[Negro]] Nurse\u201d writing in 1912 portrays this dependence: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be frank with you, if it were not for the service pan, I don\u2019t know what the majority of our Southern colored families would do. The service pan is the mainstay in many a home\u2026others may denounce the service pan, and say that it is used to support idle Negroes but many a time, when I was a cook and had the responsibility of rearing my three children upon my lone shoulders, many a time I have had the occasion to bless the Lord for the service pan!\u201d.<ref>Sharpless, pp. 74-75.</ref> Consequently, because African-American domestic workers and their families relied on \u201cpan-toting\u201d, their diets were decided by, and depended, on the white employer. Most poignantly, Richard Wright remembered waiting for his mothers\u2019 employers to finish their meals so that he could learn what his own dinner would be: \u201cIf the white people left anything, my brother and I would eat well; but if they did not, we would have our usual bread and tea. Watching the white people eat would make my empty stomach churn and I would grow vaguely angry. Why could I not eat when I was hungry? Why did I always have to wait until others were through? I could not understand why some people had food and others did not\u201d.<ref>Sharpless, pp. 102-103.</ref> \u201cToting\u201d was a custom important to African-American families\u2019 but it could not always ensure a steady supply of food. However, some employers did recognize this. One employer stated, \u201cthere are hungry children in the cabin awaiting their mothers return, when I give out my meals I bear these little blackberry pickaninnies in mind, and I never wound the feelings of any cook by asking her \u2018what that is she has under her apron.\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cI know what it is \u2013 every biscuit, scrap of meat, or bit of cake she can save during the day, and if possible, a little sugar filched from the pantry\u201d.<ref name=Hunter-132>Hunter, p. 132.</ref>\n\n== Advantages ==\n==== Advantages for the Worker ====\nMany domestic workers used pan-toting to help alleviate the consequences of low pay. Domestic workers who had no legal remedies to redress grievances sometimes used pan-toting to counter employers\u2019 tactics of dishonesty involving wages.<ref name=Hunter-61 /> They used pan-toting to their advantage as employers would refuse to pay wages. For some, pan-toting was seen as beneficial to the status of the domestic worker as it gave them greater control of their employer and their employment. For many domestic workers, pan-toting made the difference between starvation and survival. It allowed them to stretch their resources and put food on the dinner table for their family.\n\n==== Advantages for the Employer ====\nThe system of toting had advantages for employers. Most notably, it meant that they could \"pay less in cash wages, and they might hope, that because her family would have some at the end of the day, the cook would take extra care with the food, producing a finer result\".<ref name=Sharpless-154>Sharpless, p. 154.</ref> The prospect of a cook's child enjoying the food that they were preparing, encouraged the cook to take greater care in preparing the meal. In addition to the cash savings, employers also received psychological benefits from allowing toting, for the practice of employees removing food from the home \"reinforced the [[stereotype]] of African Americans as morally bankrupt and shifty characters and reinforced the notions of black inferiority and dependency and white paternalism\".<ref name=Sharpless-154 />\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nDue to its origins in slavery, pan-toting is usually associated with keeping black domestics inferior and reliant on their white employer, while making the white employer feel superior and giving. Many white employers saw the practice as a charity and therefore rejected any accountability in \u2018paying substandard wages that engendered the need for the \u201cgift\u201d\u2019.<ref name=Hunter-132 />  Many argued pan-toting was a form of payment and therefore, used it to justify low wages. '\u201cWe know that most of this so-called \u2018food\u2019 is left-overs, cold scraps and the like which we would not use on our tables again,\u201d a self-proclaimed \u201cOld Time Southerner\u201d admitted. \u201cWe know that our servants are paid a small wage.\u201d Another employer similarly conceded: \u201cTotin\u2019 was a well-established custom, and should be remembered if the wages paid to seem horrifyingly small\u201d'.<ref name=Hunter-132 /> The quality of the food from \u201cpan-toting\u201d was not always good. African-American families received leftover food on the employers\u2019 terms and the quality was often poor. \u2018Washingtonian Nellie Willoughby recalled receiving leftover roast beef \u2013 the tough, hard ends of the cut\u2019.<ref name=Sharpless-75>Sharpless, p. 75.</ref> The family often had to wait long hours for the worker to return home with the food. \u2018Educator William Henry Holtzclaw, born about 1875, remembered genuine hunger waiting for his mother to return from her cooking job\u2019.<ref name=Sharpless-75 /> Furthermore, white families ate foods strange to some African American palates, and families who relied on the service pan sometimes had to accept uncommon food, not of their choosing. Audrey Smith recalled having to learn to eat the pheasant, lamb, and veal that her mother, Georgia Anderson, brought home from Maymont. Throughout the South, cooks for Jewish families brought home chopped liver, kugel, and other Eastern European delicacies as part of their \"hookarm.\" If the food was good, plentiful, and regular, the cook might gratefully accept the service pan, but if the supply were inconsistent, the cooks family suffered'.<ref name=Sharpless-76>Sharpless, p. 76.</ref>\n\n== Rejection ==\nSome domestic workers took the opposite approach. 'To preserve this valued independence, three black domestics explained, they avoided borrowing from whites, even if this meant going without much-needed money.'<ref name=Tucker-10>Tucker (1987), p. 10.</ref> Black domestics did this as for them, they were \u2018still linked to white families in ways that were but one step away from the plantation system'.<ref name=Tucker-10 /> 'From 1900 domestic workers felt \u2018an uneasiness about such \u201cgifts\u201d. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t tot,\u201d said one, discussing the \u201cold days\u201d about slavery, when whites did not pay except by giving food in the \u201cservice pan.\u201d Black women correctly associated these gifts with a system designed to keep them in the service of whites, without the monetary means to achieve a higher standard of living\u2019.<ref name=Tucker-10 /> Several African-American domestic workers began to refuse food and claim they did not tote, especially in the 1920s. Many white women remembered black domestic workers refusing to tote and \u2018making it a condition of their acceptance of a job that they not be asked to do so\u2019.<ref name=Tucker-146>Tucker (1988), p. 146.</ref> They expressed a sense of disapproval and did not want to be compensated for low wages with left-over food.\n\n== Theft ==\nA number of white employers and authorities began to denounce pan-toting as theft and a crime. '[[Katharine DuPre Lumpkin|Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin]] recalled her upbringing in an upper-class white home: \u201cWe verily believed that a Negro could not help but steal. So we acted accordingly. We must lock up our valuables. We children should never leave the key in the food pantry door, but turn it and put it back in its hiding place\u201d'.<ref name=Sharpless-154 /> Another employer celebrated the departure of a cook as they believed her to be a thief: '\u201cThis is our Emancipation day! We are free from Susan Bell\u2026She has been robbing our table for months to support her mother\"'.<ref name=Hunter-61 /> However, a number of African-American domestic workers denied this accusation. In 1912. \u2018The Independent\u2019, a progressive New York City journal edited at the time by a prominent abolitionist, Henry Ward Beecher, printed a quasi-autobiographical account of servant life by an African-American domestic worker who was born and raised in the South and was a domestic worker for more than 30 years. In this journal she mentions the practice of pan-toting, such as the service pan. She states, \u2018\"I do not deny that the cooks find opportunity to hide away at times, along with the cold \u201cgrub\u201d a little sugar, a little flour, a little meal, or a little piece of soap; but I indignantly deny that we are thieves. We don't steal; we just \u201ctake\u201d things\u2014they are a part of the oral contract, expressed or implied.

They believed it resulted in the spouses of domestic workers becoming lazy and would poorly affect the economy if healthy men were not working, they therefore wanted \u201cpan-toting\u201d banned. A song about black men was created which portrays the attitude employers resented: \u2018I doan has to work so ha\u2019d I\u2019s got a gal in a white man\u2019s ya\u2019d; Ebery night \u2018bout half pas\u2019 eight I goes \u2018round to the white man\u2019s gate: She brings me butter and she brings me la\u2019d \u2013 I doan has to work so ha\u2019d!.\u2019<ref name=Hunter-226>Hunter, p. 226.</ref> However, some people disagreed. \u2018Some feared that ending the tradition would alienate black women and encourage them to quit\u2019. Domestic workers in Thomasville, Georgia, threatened to quit if regulations monitoring \u201cpan-toting\u201d were passed. This resulted in the towns newspaper officials to exercise caution. Other employers recognized that criminalizing customary rights would be perceived as insulting to domestic workers. \u201cThe cook\u2019s dignity is a factor in all domestic service contracts. That dignity is immediately offended if the housewife questions her about the rations she totes off after supper,\u201d a Montgomery newspaper editorialized. [...] A self-proclaimed \u201cOld Time Southerner\u201d from the city stated her objections to regulating pan-toting: \u201cIf I consent to my servant taking a little food home that is my business\u201d'.<ref name=Hunter-226 />\n\n== References ==\n===== Citations =====\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===== Bibliography =====\n* {{citation | last = Hunter | first = Tera W. | title = To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Massachusetts | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0674893092 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674893092 }}\n* {{citation | last = Sharpless | first = Rebecca | title = Cooking in Other Women\u2019s Kitchens: Domestic Workers in the South, 1865-1960 | location = Chapel Hill | publisher = University of North Carolina | year = 2010}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Tucker | first = Susan | title = A Complex Bond: Southern Black Domestic Workers and Their White Employers | work = Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies | volume = IX | issue = 3 | year = 1987 | jstor = 3346254 | pages = 6\u201313}}\n* {{cite book | last = Tucker | first = Susan | title = Telling Memories Among Southern Women: Domestic Workers and Their Employers in the Segregated South | location = Baton Rouge | publisher = Louisiana State University Press | year = 1988}}\n\n[[Category:African-American history]]\n[[Category:History of slavery]]\n[[Category:Reparations for slavery| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{copy edit|date=February 2020|for=quotations, consistency, and style}}\n\n'''Pan toting''', also known as the '''service pan''', was the practice of [[African-American]] [[domestic worker]]s taking dry goods or leftover table scraps from their white employers as a [[Reparations for slavery|form of compensation]].

They believed it resulted in the spouses of domestic workers becoming lazy and would poorly affect the economy if healthy men were not working, they therefore wanted \u201cpan-toting\u201d banned. A song about black men was created which portrays the attitude employers resented: \u2018I doan has to work so ha\u2019d I\u2019s got a gal in a white man\u2019s ya\u2019d; Ebery night \u2018bout half pas\u2019 eight I goes \u2018round to the white man\u2019s gate: She brings me butter and she brings me la\u2019d \u2013 I doan has to work so ha\u2019d!.\u2019<ref name=Hunter-226>Hunter, p. 226.</ref> However, some people disagreed. \u2018Some feared that ending the tradition would alienate black women and encourage them to quit\u2019. Domestic workers in Thomasville, Georgia, threatened to quit if regulations monitoring \u201cpan-toting\u201d were passed. This resulted in the towns newspaper officials to exercise caution. Other employers recognized that criminalizing customary rights would be perceived as insulting to domestic workers. \u201cThe cook\u2019s dignity is a factor in all domestic service contracts.

The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish colonial architecture from the XVIII century, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, the archeological museum that contains relics of the [[Lenca]] people of the prehispanic era, and the republican museum. Another square in the old town is the Plaza de la Merced, it is known for having a monument known as the obelisk and in front of it is the Iglesia de la Merced. Which was the first cathedral of the city before the current one was completed in 1711. Another atraction is the Caxa real, a colonial house that was built between 1739 and 1741 and developed by the architect Bartolom\u00e9 de Maradiaga as a center where the tributes for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] were stored, within it Gold, silver and plaster extracted from the mines of Honduras were processed, to later be shipped to Europe. On the ground floor of the building, introduce some elements that were not in common use in Central American architecture; It makes a very good difference between the purely official area, the Courtroom, the Accounting Office, the Treasury, the Azogues room, the piece of fifth silver; This sector was entered through a large hall called by the men on horseback and which were on the street that the Chiquito River rises to the Plaza Mayor. In 1774, an earthquake that caused serious damage to the structure, however, was repaired within a few months, although the house was weaker. In 1809 another earthquake damaged the building. It was rebuilt in 2013 and is currently an events center that has hosted important international political figures, such as [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Queen Leticia of Spain]], and the former President of Mexico on his visit to Honduras. \n\n<br />\n\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

[[File:Elcolegiotridentino.jpg|thumb|Colegio Tridentino de Comayagua|alt=|left|220x220px]]In February 2012 [[Comayagua prison fire|a fire at Comayagua prison]] killed more than 350 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Places of note==\n[[File:Iglesia de la merced de Comayagua.jpg|left|thumb|Iglesia de la merced in 2018]][[File:PlazaCentralComayagua.jpg|left|thumb|218x218px|Comayagua's Central Plaza.]]Right in front of the plaza is located City Hall, which has been reconstructed a couple of times. The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish colonial architecture from the XVIII century, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, the archeological museum that contains relics of the [[Lenca]] people of the prehispanic era, and the republican museum. Another square in the old town is the Plaza de la Merced, it is known for having a monument known as the obelisk and in front of it is the Iglesia de la Merced. Which was the first cathedral of the city before the current one was completed in 1711. Another atraction is the Caxa real, a colonial house that was built between 1739 and 1741 and developed by the architect Bartolom\u00e9 de Maradiaga as a center where the tributes for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] were stored, within it Gold, silver and plaster extracted from the mines of Honduras were processed, to later be shipped to Europe. On the ground floor of the building, introduce some elements that were not in common use in Central American architecture; It makes a very good difference between the purely official area, the Courtroom, the Accounting Office, the Treasury, the Azogues room, the piece of fifth silver; This sector was entered through a large hall called by the men on horseback and which were on the street that the Chiquito River rises to the Plaza Mayor. In 1774, an earthquake that caused serious damage to the structure, however, was repaired within a few months, although the house was weaker. In 1809 another earthquake damaged the building. It was rebuilt in 2013 and is currently an events center that has hosted important international political figures, such as [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Queen Leticia of Spain]], and the former President of Mexico on his visit to Honduras. \n\n<br />\n\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

The club obtained its first promotion to the National League in 2004\u20132005. Nevertheless, after only their first season in the soccer league; they were relegated to second division once again. For this reason the board of directors, bought the first division franchise from Club Municipal-Valencia of Choluteca.  The Club plays its home games at the municipal stadium 'Carlos Miranda' which currently holds about 10,000 spectators.\n\nComayagua was host to the first International Fellowship of Christian Athletes Motocross camp in September 2012. 60 men and women participated in the camp which was instructed by professional riders from the United States, Jimmy Povolny, Shawn Clark and Ryan Meyung among others. The camp was followed by a race sponsored by Colmotos Enduro and was in memory of Dylan First, a US rider who lost his life on the track the previous year. This is now an annual event in Comayagua with instructors from the US and leaders from Honduras.\n\n== Patrimony ==\n\n* Sala Capitular\n* Caxa Real\n* Columna de la Constituci\u00f3n de 1812\n* Palacio Municipal\n* Museo de arqueolog\u00eda de Comayagua\n* Museo de Arte Religioso\n* Museo Casa Caba\u00f1as (Museo de los gobernantes de la \u00e9poca federal y republicana de Honduras)\n* Catedral de Comayagua (1634)\n* Iglesia de la Merced (1550)\n* Iglesia de San Francisco (1560)\n* Iglesia de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1580)\n* Iglesia la Caridad (XVII) \n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Comayagua Department}}\n\n\n[[Category:Comayagua| 01]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of the Comayagua Department]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Former national capitals]]\n[[Category:Audencia of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Colonial Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1537]]\n[[Category:1537 establishments in North America]]\n[[Category:1537 establishments in the Spanish Empire]]\n", "name_user": "Luis Alfredo Romero", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comayagua"}

Each server is operated by and stays under the sole administration of a distinct entity.\n\nPeerTube uses the [[ActivityPub]] protocol in order to allow decentralization and compatibility with other [[fediverse]] services, which can prevent [[vendor lock-in]] and makes it more resilient against [[Censorship of YouTube|censorship]].<ref name=\"blender\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blender.org/media-exposure/youtube-blocks-blender-videos-worldwide/|title=YouTube Blocks Blender Videos Worldwide|first=Blender|last=Foundation|website=blender.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/peertube-a-censorship-resistent-youtube-alternative-180623/|title=PeerTube: A 'Censorship' Resistent(sic) YouTube Alternative|date=2018-06-23|website=TorrentFreak|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nThe software relies on the [[PostgreSQL]] [[Database|DBMS]] and is integrated in popular video platforms like Reddit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/pull/5065|title=Add peertube by aliceinwire \u00b7 Pull Request #5065 \u00b7 honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> and Kodi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://framagit.org/StCyr/plugin.video.peertube|title=Cyrille Bollu / plugin.video.peertube|website=GitLab|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients]]\n* [[Cooperative storage cloud]]\n* [[Decentralized computing]]\n* [[InterPlanetary File System]]\n* [[List of video hosting services]]\n* [[Peer-to-peer web hosting]]\n* [[Self-certifying File System]]\n* [[Solid (web decentralization)]]\n* [[ZeroNet]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://joinpeertube.org Official website]\n* [https://github.com/Chocobozzz Source code] on [[GitHub]]\n\n{{Portal bar|Internet|Free and open-source software}}\n{{File sharing|state=collapsed}}\n{{BitTorrent|state=collapsed}}\n{{File systems|state=collapsed}}\n{{Internet censorship circumvention technologies|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer]]\n[[Category:Video hosting]]\n[[Category:Web applications]]\n[[Category:Free software websites]]\n[[Category:French social networking websites]]\n[[Category:Software using the GNU AGPL license]]\n", "name_user": "Ajayajayaj", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copies are already ad free on YouTube.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerTube"}

For nearly 100 years it was a major commercial hub and provincial capital of Siamese province of Inner Cambodia (1795-1907), though it was always populated by Khmer, with some ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and Chinese. Battambang remains the hub of Cambodia's northwest, connecting the region with [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Thailand]].\n\nThe city is situated on the [[Sangkae River]], a tranquil, small body of water that winds its way picturesquely through [[Battambang Province]]. As with much of Cambodia, French Colonial architecture is a notable aspect of the city, with some of the best-preserved examples in the country.\n\n==History==\nBattambang was established as an important trading city with around 2,500 residents in the 18th century. The population was centred along a single road parallel to the [[Sangkae River]] (''Stung Sangkae''). In 1795 Siam (modern-day Thailand) annexed much of north western Cambodia including the current provinces of [[Banteay Meanchey Province|Banteay Meanchey]], [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], [[Oddar Meanchey Province|Oddar Meanchey]], [[Pailin]], and [[Siem Reap Province|Siem Reap]] into the province of Inner Cambodia. The Siamese ruled Battambang as a provincial capital through the Thai-speaking Khmer [[House of Abhaiwongse|Aphaiwong family]],<ref name=Goscha>{{cite book |last=Goscha |first=Christopher E. |date=1999 |title=Thailand and the Southeast Asian Networks of the Vietnamese Revolution, 1885-1954 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RE5XmjajAvkC&q=Aphaiwong#v=snippet&q=Aphaiwong&f=false |location=Surrey, UK |publisher=Curzon Press, Nordic Institute of Asian Studies |page= 123 |isbn=0700706224 |accessdate=3 Dec 2013}}</ref> a branch of the Khmer royal family, which governed for six generations until 1907 when the province was ceded to the French to be reunited with Cambodia as part of the [[French Indochina]] colony.\n\nFollowing colonization by the [[France|French]], an urban layout was developed which resulted in an enlarged French colonial town. This first attempt at modernization resulted in well-defined streets laid in a grid pattern, building of urban structures and three main streets parallel to the Sangkae River, and the linking of both banks by the construction of two bridges in 1917. Military and prison facilities were also erected. Nineteen years later, a second urban development plan was implemented with a newly constructed [[Rail transport in Cambodia|railway]] linking Battambang to [[Phnom Penh]]. The urban structures were extended to the west of the town creating urban hubs oriented around the railway station. The large residential villas and public buildings built during this period of French development significantly changed the landscape of the previously remote city. A subsequent third urban development plan for Battambang involved the north, east and south of the city. This vast undertaking, which required long-term planning to integrate all of the previous work, resulted in a modern provincial capital that was by far the most developed region of Cambodia outside of Phnom Penh.\n\nMuch later, more infrastructure and public facilities were built under the modernization program of the Cambodian government led by [[Norodom Sihanouk|Prince Sihanouk]]. Several provincial departments, a court house and other public buildings were added on both sides of the river. Textile and garment factories were built by French and [[China|Chinese]] investors, the [[Battambang Airport]] was constructed, and the railway line was extended to the Thai border at [[Poipet]]. To serve the cultural needs of the population, numerous schools and a university were built as well as a sports centre, museum and an exhibition hall.\n\n== Climate ==\n{{col-begin|width=75%}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Weather box\n|location = Battambang\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan high F = 88\n|Feb high F = 92\n|Mar high F = 95\n|Apr high F = 96\n|May high F = 93\n|Jun high F = 91\n|Jul high F = 89\n|Aug high F =89\n|Sep high F = 88\n|Oct high F = 86\n|Nov high F =86\n|Dec high F = 86\n|year high F = 90\n|Jan low F = 67\n|Feb low F = 70\n|Mar low F = 73\n|Apr low F = 76\n|May low F = 76\n|Jun low F = 76\n|Jul low F = 76\n|Aug low F = 76\n|Sep low F = 75\n|Oct low F = 74\n|Nov low F = 72\n|Dec low F = 68\n|year low F = 73\n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Feb precipitation inch =0.7\n|Mar precipitation inch = 1.9\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.4\n|May precipitation inch = 6.2\n|Jun precipitation inch = 5.8\n|Jul precipitation inch = 6.1\n|Aug precipitation inch = 6.1\n|Sep precipitation inch = 10.2\n|Oct precipitation inch = 8.8\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1\n|year precipitation inch = 53.7\n|source 1 = Weatherbase <ref name=Weatherbase>\n{{cite web\n|url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=26984&refer=wikipedia |title =Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Batdambang, Cambodia\n|publisher=Weatherbase\n|year=2011\n}}\nRetrieved on November 24, 2011.\n</ref>\n|date=November 2011\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[File:Wat Peapahd.Battambang.2009.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wat Peapahd Temple in Battambang]]\n\n==Attractions==\n\n\n\n'''Kamping Puoy Lake'''\n\nLocated between two mountains, named Phnom Kul or Phnom Ta Nget and Phnom Kamping Puoy, at Ta Nget village, Ta Kriem Commune is {{convert|35|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from the provincial town.

For nearly 100 years it was a major commercial hub and provincial capital of Siamese province of Inner Cambodia (1795-1907), though it was always populated by Khmer, with some ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and Chinese. Battambang remains the hub of Cambodia's northwest, connecting the region with [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Thailand]].\n\nThe city is situated on the [[Sangkae River]], a tranquil, small body of water that winds its way picturesquely through [[Battambang Province]]. As with much of Cambodia, French Colonial architecture is a notable aspect of the city, with some of the best-preserved examples in the country.\n\n==History==\nBattambang was established as an important trading city with around 2,500 residents in the 18th century. The population was centred along a single road parallel to the [[Sangkae River]] (''Stung Sangkae''). In 1795 Siam (modern-day Thailand) annexed much of north western Cambodia including the current provinces of [[Banteay Meanchey Province|Banteay Meanchey]], [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], [[Oddar Meanchey Province|Oddar Meanchey]], [[Pailin]], and [[Siem Reap Province|Siem Reap]] into the province of Inner Cambodia. The Siamese ruled Battambang as a provincial capital through the Thai-speaking Khmer [[House of Abhaiwongse|Aphaiwong family]],<ref name=Goscha>{{cite book |last=Goscha |first=Christopher E. |date=1999 |title=Thailand and the Southeast Asian Networks of the Vietnamese Revolution, 1885-1954 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RE5XmjajAvkC&q=Aphaiwong#v=snippet&q=Aphaiwong&f=false |location=Surrey, UK |publisher=Curzon Press, Nordic Institute of Asian Studies |page= 123 |isbn=0700706224 |accessdate=3 Dec 2013}}</ref> a branch of the Khmer royal family, which governed for six generations until 1907 when the province was ceded to the French to be reunited with Cambodia as part of the [[French Indochina]] colony.\n\nFollowing colonization by the [[France|French]], an urban layout was developed which resulted in an enlarged French colonial town. This first attempt at modernization resulted in well-defined streets laid in a grid pattern, building of urban structures and three main streets parallel to the Sangkae River, and the linking of both banks by the construction of two bridges in 1917. Military and prison facilities were also erected. Nineteen years later, a second urban development plan was implemented with a newly constructed [[Rail transport in Cambodia|railway]] linking Battambang to [[Phnom Penh]]. The urban structures were extended to the west of the town creating urban hubs oriented around the railway station. The large residential villas and public buildings built during this period of French development significantly changed the landscape of the previously remote city. A subsequent third urban development plan for Battambang involved the north, east and south of the city. This vast undertaking, which required long-term planning to integrate all of the previous work, resulted in a modern provincial capital that was by far the most developed region of Cambodia outside of Phnom Penh.\n\nMuch later, more infrastructure and public facilities were built under the modernization program of the Cambodian government led by [[Norodom Sihanouk|Prince Sihanouk]]. Several provincial departments, a court house and other public buildings were added on both sides of the river. Textile and garment factories were built by French and [[China|Chinese]] investors, the [[Battambang Airport]] was constructed, and the railway line was extended to the Thai border at [[Poipet]]. To serve the cultural needs of the population, numerous schools and a university were built as well as a sports centre, museum and an exhibition hall.\n\n== Climate ==\n{{col-begin|width=75%}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Weather box\n|location = Battambang\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan high F = 88\n|Feb high F = 92\n|Mar high F = 95\n|Apr high F = 96\n|May high F = 93\n|Jun high F = 91\n|Jul high F = 89\n|Aug high F =89\n|Sep high F = 88\n|Oct high F = 86\n|Nov high F =86\n|Dec high F = 86\n|year high F = 90\n|Jan low F = 67\n|Feb low F = 70\n|Mar low F = 73\n|Apr low F = 76\n|May low F = 76\n|Jun low F = 76\n|Jul low F = 76\n|Aug low F = 76\n|Sep low F = 75\n|Oct low F = 74\n|Nov low F = 72\n|Dec low F = 68\n|year low F = 73\n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Feb precipitation inch =0.7\n|Mar precipitation inch = 1.9\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.4\n|May precipitation inch = 6.2\n|Jun precipitation inch = 5.8\n|Jul precipitation inch = 6.1\n|Aug precipitation inch = 6.1\n|Sep precipitation inch = 10.2\n|Oct precipitation inch = 8.8\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1\n|year precipitation inch = 53.7\n|source 1 = Weatherbase <ref name=Weatherbase>\n{{cite web\n|url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=26984&refer=wikipedia |title =Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Batdambang, Cambodia\n|publisher=Weatherbase\n|year=2011\n}}\nRetrieved on November 24, 2011.\n</ref>\n|date=November 2011\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[File:Wat Peapahd.Battambang.2009.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wat Peapahd Temple in Battambang]]\n\n==Attractions==\n\n\n\n'''Kamping Puoy Lake'''\n\nLocated between two mountains, named Phnom Kul or Phnom Ta Nget and Phnom Kamping Puoy, at Ta Nget village, Ta Kriem Commune is {{convert|35|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from the provincial town.

[[Nick Fury]], director of S.H.I.E.L.D., later reveals this to Stark, and Romanoff then helps Stark to thwart the plans of villains [[Justin Hammer]] and [[Ivan Vanko]], the latter of whom has remotely taken control of an army of military drones and the armor of Stark's friend James Rhodes. Romanoff successfully defeats Hammer's security forces to return control of the Rhodes' armor, allowing Stark and Rhodes to defeat Vanko and the drones.\n===Battle of New York===\nSome months later, while Loki begins his attack on Earth, Romanoff is being held prisoner and interrogated by Russians. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] is able to contact Romanoff to inform her that Loki has compromised Barton, and Romanoff promptly overcomes her captors, whom she had only allowed to capture her as a ploy to extract information. Romanoff recruits [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] from his seclusion in [[Kolkata]] to use his expertise to track the gamma signature of Loki's scepter. On board S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicarrier, she tricks Loki into revealing his plan to cause Banner to become the Hulk, but is too late, as Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and pursue Romanoff until he is distracted by [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rogers]], Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and Hulk then rally in defense of Loki's next target, New York City.\n===Working with Captain America===\nTwo years after the [[The Avengers (2012 film)|Battle of New York]], Romanoff and Rogers are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from [[Batroc the Leaper|Georges Batroc]] and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. After an attempt on Fury's life, Rogers becomes a fugitive hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., and meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the [[mind uploading|preserved consciousness]] of [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after [[World War II]], [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Secretary of Internal Security [[Alexander Pierce]] is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. To prevent Hydra from using helicarriers to attack the world's superheroes, Romanoff, disguised as a World Security Council member, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Romanoff later appears before a Senate subcommittee, while Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells.\n===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===\nRomanoff continues to work with the Avengers, helping them to attack a Hydra facility where they recover Loki's scepter. She becomes romantically involved with Banner, but he and Stark accidentally create Ultron, who captures Romanoff and takes her to Sokovia. Rescued by Banner, she pushes him off a ledge to force his transformation into the Hulk to aid in the battle against Ultron, an act which later influences Hulk to leave Earth altogether. Sokovia is destroyed in the battle, leading to the passage of the Sokovia Accords, over which Tony Stark and Steve Rogers have a falling out. Romanoff initially sides with Stark's team, accompanying them to battle Rogers and his allies at Leipzig Airport, but Romanoff then switches sides to allow Rogers to escape with Bucky Barnes.\n===The Infinity War===\nRomanoff later reconnects with a fugitive Rogers, and, two years after the passing of the Sokovia Accords, when Thanos sends his minions to retrieve Infinity Stones on Earth, she, Rogers, and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] arrive in Scotland in time to defend [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] from an attack by members of the Black Order. She travels to [[Wakanda]] to aid in the battle against the forces of Thanos, but the defenders are unable to prevent Thanos from obtaining the stones and using them to eliminate half of all life in the Universe. \n\nRomanoff survives the snap, and travels with the newly arrived Captain Marvel and other surviving Avengers to Thanos' garden planet to attempt to recover the Infinity Stones, only to learn that Thanos has already destroyed them. Romanoff then returns to Earth to continue to lead the remnants of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers from the former Avengers headquarters in upstate New York.\n\nFive years after the Infinity War, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] comes to the Avengers headquarters and informs Romanoff and Rogers that he has been trapped in the quantum realm, where time passes differently, affording a means to steal the Infinity Stones from the past and bring back those who were destroyed by Thanos. After working to recruit Stark and Banner to the cause, Romanoff travels to a past version of the planet Vormir with Barton. After an initial scuffle with him over the decision regarding whom to sacrifice for the Soul Stone, Romanoff sacrifices her life so that Barton can obtain the Soul Stone and eventually return to his family. The original five members following the mission later mourn her death and honor her sacrifice, with Banner finally using the Stark Gauntlet to bring the disintegrated back to life. Banner later notes that he had tried at that time to also bring Romanoff back, and had been unable.\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nRomanoff in the MCU is a founding member of the Avengers, while in the comics she is a much later addition, and initially an antagonist to the team. This version also showed a romance with [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] that was mostly explored in ''Age of Ultron'' but hinted at in later and previous films. She is also very close to Clint Barton's family, unlike in the Ultimate Comics where she murders each member before she is killed by Hawkeye.\n\n==Reception==\nDavid Edelstein of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' described the presence of the female leads in ''Iron Man 2'' as \"a gam-off between Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson in which Paltrow wins on length and then disappears in the glare of her opponent's headlights\".<ref name=\"NewYorkMagReview\">{{Cite web|date=May 2, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |author=David Edelstein |title=Battle of the Rehabbed Stars |work=[[New York Magazine]] |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJTLsz4h?url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |archivedate=August 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' notes that her entrance in that film \"famously chose to focus on her desirability rather than her staggering combat skills\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/avengers-endgame-black-widow-death-scarlett-johansson|title=How Avengers: Endgame Failed Black Widow|first=Laura|last=Bradley|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA ''Daily Beast'' review of the character's role in ''Age of Ultron'' lamented that the character had been made to \"function as a cog that services the storylines\" of the male characters.<ref name=\"Disgrace\"/> ''Vanity Fair'' described the development of the character across the films as \"a trajectory that's been as all over the map as Black Widow's varying hairstyles\", stating that she \"spent her years in the MCU as an accessory to narratives foregrounding other heroes\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\nVox notes that in ''Avengers: Endgame'', \"Johansson takes Romanoff \u2014 usually the dependable, no-frills assassin \u2014 into quiet, stoic suffering\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/23/18512851/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-miracle|title=Avengers: Endgame is a Marvel miracle|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|publisher=Vox|date=April 23, 2019}}</ref> while ''Vanity Fair'' laments that the film \"never gives her or her death room to breathe\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Nick Fury]], director of S.H.I.E.L.D., later reveals this to Stark, and Romanoff then helps Stark to thwart the plans of villains [[Justin Hammer]] and [[Ivan Vanko]], the latter of whom has remotely taken control of an army of military drones and the armor of Stark's friend James Rhodes. Romanoff successfully defeats Hammer's security forces to return control of the Rhodes' armor, allowing Stark and Rhodes to defeat Vanko and the drones.\n===Battle of New York===\nSome months later, while Loki begins his attack on Earth, Romanoff is being held prisoner and interrogated by Russians. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] is able to contact Romanoff to inform her that Loki has compromised Barton, and Romanoff promptly overcomes her captors, whom she had only allowed to capture her as a ploy to extract information. Romanoff recruits [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] from his seclusion in [[Kolkata]] to use his expertise to track the gamma signature of Loki's scepter. On board S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicarrier, she tricks Loki into revealing his plan to cause Banner to become the Hulk, but is too late, as Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and pursue Romanoff until he is distracted by [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rogers]], Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and Hulk then rally in defense of Loki's next target, New York City.\n===Working with Captain America===\nTwo years after the [[The Avengers (2012 film)|Battle of New York]], Romanoff and Rogers are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from [[Batroc the Leaper|Georges Batroc]] and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. After an attempt on Fury's life, Rogers becomes a fugitive hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., and meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the [[mind uploading|preserved consciousness]] of [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after [[World War II]], [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Secretary of Internal Security [[Alexander Pierce]] is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. To prevent Hydra from using helicarriers to attack the world's superheroes, Romanoff, disguised as a World Security Council member, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Romanoff later appears before a Senate subcommittee, while Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells.\n===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===\nRomanoff continues to work with the Avengers, helping them to attack a Hydra facility where they recover Loki's scepter. She becomes romantically involved with Banner, but he and Stark accidentally create Ultron, who captures Romanoff and takes her to Sokovia. Rescued by Banner, she pushes him off a ledge to force his transformation into the Hulk to aid in the battle against Ultron, an act which later influences Hulk to leave Earth altogether. Sokovia is destroyed in the battle, leading to the passage of the Sokovia Accords, over which Tony Stark and Steve Rogers have a falling out. Romanoff initially sides with Stark's team, accompanying them to battle Rogers and his allies at Leipzig Airport, but Romanoff then switches sides to allow Rogers to escape with Bucky Barnes.\n===The Infinity War===\nRomanoff later reconnects with a fugitive Rogers, and, two years after the passing of the Sokovia Accords, when Thanos sends his minions to retrieve Infinity Stones on Earth, she, Rogers, and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] arrive in Scotland in time to defend [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] from an attack by members of the Black Order. She travels to [[Wakanda]] to aid in the battle against the forces of Thanos, but the defenders are unable to prevent Thanos from obtaining the stones and using them to eliminate half of all life in the Universe. \n\nRomanoff survives the snap, and travels with the newly arrived Captain Marvel and other surviving Avengers to Thanos' garden planet to attempt to recover the Infinity Stones, only to learn that Thanos has already destroyed them. Romanoff then returns to Earth to continue to lead the remnants of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers from the former Avengers headquarters in upstate New York.\n\nFive years after the Infinity War, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] comes to the Avengers headquarters and informs Romanoff and Rogers that he has been trapped in the quantum realm, where time passes differently, affording a means to steal the Infinity Stones from the past and bring back those who were destroyed by Thanos. After working to recruit Stark and Banner to the cause, Romanoff travels to a past version of the planet Vormir with Barton. After an initial scuffle with him over the decision regarding whom to sacrifice for the Soul Stone, Romanoff sacrifices her life so that Barton can obtain the Soul Stone and eventually return to his family. The original five members following the mission later mourn her death and honor her sacrifice, with Banner finally using the Stark Gauntlet to bring the disintegrated back to life. Banner later notes that he had tried at that time to also bring Romanoff back, and had been unable.\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nRomanoff in the MCU is a founding member of the Avengers, while in the comics she is a much later addition, and initially an antagonist to the team. This version also showed a romance with [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] that was mostly explored in ''Age of Ultron'' but hinted at in later and previous films. She is also very close to Clint Barton's family, unlike in the Ultimate Comics where she murders each member before she is killed by Hawkeye.\n\n==Reception==\nDavid Edelstein of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' described the presence of the female leads in ''Iron Man 2'' as \"a gam-off between Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson in which Paltrow wins on length and then disappears in the glare of her opponent's headlights\".<ref name=\"NewYorkMagReview\">{{Cite web|date=May 2, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |author=David Edelstein |title=Battle of the Rehabbed Stars |work=[[New York Magazine]] |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJTLsz4h?url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |archivedate=August 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' notes that her entrance in that film \"famously chose to focus on her desirability rather than her staggering combat skills\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/avengers-endgame-black-widow-death-scarlett-johansson|title=How Avengers: Endgame Failed Black Widow|first=Laura|last=Bradley|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA ''Daily Beast'' review of the character's role in ''Age of Ultron'' lamented that the character had been made to \"function as a cog that services the storylines\" of the male characters.<ref name=\"Disgrace\"/> ''Vanity Fair'' described the development of the character across the films as \"a trajectory that's been as all over the map as Black Widow's varying hairstyles\", stating that she \"spent her years in the MCU as an accessory to narratives foregrounding other heroes\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\nVox notes that in ''Avengers: Endgame'', \"Johansson takes Romanoff \u2014 usually the dependable, no-frills assassin \u2014 into quiet, stoic suffering\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/23/18512851/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-miracle|title=Avengers: Endgame is a Marvel miracle|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|publisher=Vox|date=April 23, 2019}}</ref> while ''Vanity Fair'' laments that the film \"never gives her or her death room to breathe\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art. After 3 years living in a monastery in India, Mark and her mother moved to Berlin, and after graduating high school at the age of 18 she moved to New York to live with her godparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edailybuzz.com/2019/03/12/amber-mark-wiki-bio-2019-age-height-net-worth-birthday-mother-boyfriend-social-media/|title=Amber Mark Wiki, Bio 2019: Age, Height, Net worth, Birthday, Mother, Boyfriend, Social Media.|date=March 12, 2019|work=edailybuzz.com|accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer mother, Mia, died on 3 June 2013 at the age of 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5Y_Mni-eU|title=Amber Mark - Monsoon (Official Video) ft.

She stated in an interview that this was when she realized that being an artist was what she wanted to do.<ref>(2017, August 21) Retrieved November 19, 2019, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3pNkDnoo5k&t=102s</ref> Her mother was a huge part of her early life and one of her first songs was in dedication to her mother's passing in 2013.<ref>Ciara, H., & Calum, S.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\".

Then my mum passed away on June 3, at 10:23pm in 2013. Since then, I'd see threes everywhere.

Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art. After 3 years living in a monastery in India, Mark and her mother moved to Berlin, and after graduating high school at the age of 18 she moved to New York to live with her godparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edailybuzz.com/2019/03/12/amber-mark-wiki-bio-2019-age-height-net-worth-birthday-mother-boyfriend-social-media/|title=Amber Mark Wiki, Bio 2019: Age, Height, Net worth, Birthday, Mother, Boyfriend, Social Media.|date=March 12, 2019|work=edailybuzz.com|accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer mother, Mia, died on 3 June 2013 at the age of 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5Y_Mni-eU|title=Amber Mark - Monsoon (Official Video) ft.

In high school, she joined the school choir and an \u201cafter school band program\u201d. She stated in an interview that this was when she realized that being an artist was what she wanted to do.<ref>(2017, August 21) Retrieved November 19, 2019, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3pNkDnoo5k&t=102s</ref> Her mother was a huge part of her early life and one of her first songs was in dedication to her mother's passing in 2013.<ref>Ciara, H., & Calum, S.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\". Mark explains that it was named that because \"Three has been a really common number in my life. My mother was born in 1953, my brother was born in 1983 and I was born in 1993. Then my mum passed away on June 3, at 10:23pm in 2013. Since then, I'd see threes everywhere. When I was writing the EP in New York... and out of the zone, I would check the clock and I always remember it being 3:33am.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.herecomesthesong.com/single-post/2017/07/19/Amber-Mark-a-songwriters-desire-for-more-S-P-A-C-E|title=Amber Mark: a songwriter's desire for more S P A C E|last=Fanthorpe|first=Katie|date=July 19, 2017|work=Here Comes The Song|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> The album art features a photo taken by her sister, in which Mark is wearing a watch that reads 3:33.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-amber-mark/|title=Interview: Amber Mark|last=Bedian|first=Knar|date=2017-10-07|website=Sound of Boston - Boston Music Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> Each song on the record represents one of the six stages of grief.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earmilk.com/2017/05/15/amber-mark-shows-prowess-in-life-and-music-on-debut-333am-ep/|title=Amber Mark shows prowess in life and music on debut '3:33am' EP|last=Evans|first=Steph|date=2017-05-15|website=EARMILK|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> The song \"Monsoon\" includes samples of her mother's voice, which she explained in an interview with [http://www.soundofboston.com Sound of Boston] as \"a video recording of me flying back to New York for the summer while we were living in Berlin.

First seen in May/June 2002.\n* ''Lego BrickMaster Magazine'' - The \"premium\" version of ''Lego Magazine'' with more pages and exclusive content.  First seen in November 2004.

Bionicle comics were replaced with Hero Factory comics in Fall 2010.\n* ''Lego Mania Magazine'' - Earlier version of ''Lego magazine'', last seen in March/April 2002.\n* ''School Edition'' - A new edition with educational articles relating to Lego themes and products, games, activities and others.

{"title_page": "Classification of demons", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=July 2016}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2016}}\n{{undue weight|date=July 2016}}\n}}\n[[Image:Schongauer Anthony.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[The Temptation of St Anthony (Schongauer)|The Temptation of St. Anthony]]'' by [[Martin Schongauer]]]]\nThere have been various attempts throughout history by [[theologian]] scholars in the '''classification of Christian demons''' for the purpose of understanding the biblical and [[myth|mythological context]] of adversarial spirits. Theologians have written dissertations in [[Christian demonology]], classical [[occultism]], [[classical mythology]] and [[Renaissance magic]] to clarify the connections between these spirits and their influence in various cultures. The study of [[demonology]] was historically used to understand morality, behavioral tendencies, and has even been used as symbolism to relay anecdotal tales in with which they lure people into temptation and may also include the angels or [[saint]]s that were believed to have been their adversaries; an idea which derived from the Biblical battle between the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and Piccalo in The [[Book of Revelation]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#12:7|12:7-9]]) describing a [[war in heaven]] which resulted in Satan and his angels being expelled from Heaven. The classifications of these fallen angels are based on many other characteristics as well, such as behaviors that caused their fall from heaven, physical appearances or the methods that were used to torment people, cause maladies, or elicit dreams, emotions, etc. Most authors who wrote theological dissertations on the subject either truly believed in the existence of infernal spirits, or wrote as a philosophical guide to understanding an ancient perspective of behavior and morality in folklore and religious themes.\n\n==Classification by domain==  \nIn the study of demonology, infernal spirits are often classified by domain, meaning their attribution to a specified sphere of activity or knowledge. Oftentimes this means a specific moral sin or questionable behavior to which some people are prone. They may even be attributed to the methods they cause trouble to humans by the use of certain misfortunes, maladies, or addictions. In general, the domain of a demon is reflected on whatever authority they hold in their interaction with mankind. This idea holds a similar connotation to the gods of classical mythology as each have their own tasks and abilities according to their authority and each interact with mankind in their own unique way. It can be noted that according to each author listed below, the domain of each demon is varied greatly on either preference or perspective. It can also be seen that each author chooses and classifies demons differently based on the author's personal set of beliefs or politics.\n\n===The Testament of Solomon===\n{{main article|Testament of Solomon}}\nThe ''Testament of Solomon'' is an [[pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphical]] work, purportedly written by King [[Solomon]], in which the author mostly describes particular [[demon]]s whom he enslaved to help build the [[Solomon's Temple|temple]], the questions he put to them about their deeds and how they could be thwarted, and their answers, which provide a kind of self-help manual against demonic activity. The date is very dubious, though it is considered the oldest surviving work particularly concerned with individual demons.<ref>[http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/testamen.htm ''The Testament of Solomon''], trans.

''The Testament of Solomon'', ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', Vol. 11, No. 1, (October ,1898)</ref>\n\n===Psellus' classification of demons===\n[[Michael Psellus]] prepared a classification of demons in the 11th century, which was an inspiration for the classification [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]] prepared later. Psellus divided demons into Empyreal (Fiery), Aerial, Subterranean, Lucifugous (Heliophobic), Aqueous, and Terrene (Terrestrial).<ref>''De operatione daemonum.'' Tr. Marcus Collisson. Sydney 1843.

Read the original damn text instead of some new age bullshit. -->\n\n[[Alphonso de Spina]], in 1467, prepared a classification of demons based on several criteria:\n* Demons of [[destiny|fate]]\n* [[Incubus|Incubi]] and [[Succubus|succubi]]\n* Wandering groups or armies of demons can include multiple regions in hell\n* [[Familiar spirit|Familiars]]\n* [[Drude]]s\n* [[Cambion]]s and other demons that are born from the union of a demon with a human being.\n* Liar and mischievous demons\n* Demons that attack the saints\n* Demons that try to induce old women to attend [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|Witches' Sabbaths]]\n\nThis classification is somewhat capricious and it is difficult to find a criterion for it. It seems that Spina was inspired by several legends and stories. The drudes belong to [[German folklore]].  Familiars, goblins, and other mischievous demons belong to the folklore of most European countries.\n\nThe belief in incubi and succubi (and their ability to procreate) seem to have inspired the seventh category, but it could also have been inspired in the Talmudic legend of demons having sexual intercourse with mortal women (see also [[Mastema]]).\n\nThe visions of tempting demons that some early (and not so early) saints had, perhaps inspired the ninth category (e.g. the visions of [[Anthony the Great]]).\n\nThe idea of old women attending Sabbaths was common during the European [[Middle Age]] and [[Renaissance]], and Spina mentioned it before the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]].'' i will amke this make no sence bc wikipedia is not a good thing for education\n\n===Agrippa's classification of demons===\nIn ''De occulta philosophia'' (1509-1510), [[Cornelius Agrippa]] proposed several classifications for demons. One is based in the number four and the cardinal points, with the ruling demons being Oriens (East), [[Paimon|Paymon]] (west), [[Egin (demon)|Egyn]] (North) and [[Amaymon]] (South). The same four demons appear in the ''Semiphoras and Schemhamforas''.<ref>[http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agrippa2.htm Cornelius Agrippa, ''De occulta philosophia'']</ref><ref>[http://www.esotericarchives.com/moses/67moses2.htm#appendix3 The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]</ref>\nAnother classification, based in the number nine, has the following orders of demons: False spirits, Spirits of lying, Vessels of iniquity, Avengers of wickedness, Jugglers, Airy powers, Furies sowing mischief, Sifters or triers, Tempters or ensnarers (See Barrett's classification below).\n\n===Binsfeld's classification of demons===\n[[Peter Binsfeld]] prepared a classification of demons in 1589 known as the Princes of Hell. His demon classification was, like the earlier English ''Lanterne of Light'', based on the [[seven deadly sins]], though it differed slightly from the English text.\n* 1. [[Lucifer]]: Pride\n* 2. [[Mammon]]: Greed\n* 3. [[Asmodeus]]: Lust\n* 4. [[Leviathan]]: Envy\n* 5. [[Beelzebub]]: Gluttony\n* 6. [[Satan]]: Wrath\n* 7.

Within 3 short books James wrote a dissertation in the form of a philosophical play, making arguments and comparisons between magic, sorcery and witchcraft but wrote also his classifications of demons into 4 sections. His classification were not based on separate demonic entities with their names, ranks, or titles but rather categorized them based on 4 methods used by any given devil to cause mischief or torment on a living individual or a deceased corpse. The purpose was to relay the belief that spirits caused maladies and that magic was possible only through demonic influence. He further quotes previous authors who state that each devil has the ability to appear in diverse shapes or forms for varying arrays of purposes as well. In his description of them, he relates that demons are under the direct supervision of God and are unable to act without permission, further illustrating how demonic forces are used as a ''\"Rod of Correction\"'' when men stray from the will of God and may be commissioned by witches, or magicians to conduct acts of ill will against others but will ultimately only conduct works that will end in the further glorification of God despite their attempts to do otherwise.<ref>{{cite book|last1=King James|title=Daemonologie.

This classification is based on the [[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchies]], according to the sins the devil tempts one to commit, and includes the demons' adversaries (who suffered that temptation without falling).\n\nNote that many demons' names are exclusively French or unknown in other catalogs. St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist are the two St. Johns to whom Michaelis refers. The other saints are cited only by their name without making clear, i.e., which Francis is mentioned (of Assisi?).\n\n====First hierarchy====\nThe first hierarchy includes angels that were [[Seraphim]], [[Cherubim]] and [[Thrones]].\n* [[Beelzebub]] was a prince of the Seraphim, just below Lucifer. Beelzebub, along with Lucifer and [[Leviathan]], were the first three angels to fall. He tempts men with pride and is opposed by St. [[Francis of Assisi]].\n* [[Leviathan]] was also a prince of the Seraphim who tempts people to give into heresy, and is opposed by [[St. Peter]].\n* [[Asmodeus]] was also a prince of the Seraphim, burning with desire to tempt men into wantonness. He is opposed by St. [[John the Baptist]].\n* [[Berith (demon)|Berith]] was a prince of the Cherubim. He tempts men to commit homicide, and to be quarrelsome, contentious, and blasphemous. He is opposed by [[St. Barnabas]].\n* [[Astaroth]] was a prince of Thrones, who tempts men to be lazy and is opposed by [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]].\n* [[Verrine (demon)|Verrine]] was also a prince of Thrones, just below Astaroth. He tempts men with impatience and is opposed by St. Dominic.\n* [[Gressil]] was the third prince of Thrones, who tempts men with impurity and is opposed by St. Bernard.\n* [[Soneillon]] was the fourth prince of Thrones, who tempts men to hate and is opposed by St. Stephen.<ref>\"les demons estans interrogez respondirent qu'ils estoient trois au corps de Louyse, y estans par le moyen d'vn malefice, & que le premier d'eux se nommoit Verrine, l'autre Gresil, & le dernier Sonneillon, & que tous estoient du troisiesme ordre, s\u00e7auoir au rang des Throsnes.\" (Histoire admirable de la possession et conversion d'vne penitente [] exorcisee [] soubs l'authorit\u00e9 du R.P.

He tempts men with hardness of heart and is opposed by St. Vincent and [[Vincent Ferrer]].\n* Carnivale was also a prince of Powers. He tempts men to obscenity and shamelessness, and is opposed by [[John the Evangelist]].\n* Oeillet was a prince of Dominions. He tempts men to break the vow of poverty and is opposed by St. Martin.\n* [[Rosier (demon)|Rosier]] was the second in the order of Dominions. He tempts men against sexual purity and is opposed by St. Basil.\n* [[Belial|Belias]] was the prince of Virtues. He tempts men with arrogance and women to be vain, raise wonton children, and gossip during mass. He is opposed by St. Francis de Paul.\n\n====Third hierarchy====\nThe third hierarchy includes Principalities, Archangels, and Angels.\n* Verrier was the prince of Principalities. He tempts men against the vow of obedience and is opposed by St. Bernard.\n* Olivier was the prince of the Archangels. He tempts men with cruelty and mercilessness toward the poor and is opposed by St. Lawrence.\n* Luvart was prince of Angels. At the time of Michaelis's writing, Luvart was believed to be in the body of a Sister Madeleine.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology''.  Rossell Hope Robbins (1912).  Bonanza Books.

These offices are usually elaborated in several [[grimoire]]s which determines their authority in hell or abilities. Demons categorized by office are often depicted in a militant hierarchy, in which a general may hold command over some designated legion for a specialized function which they may trouble men. Other theologians have determined the classification of a spirit's office depending on the times or locations which they roam the Earth.\n\n===''The Book of Abramelin''===\n''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'', possibly written in the 14th or 15th century, lists four princes of the demons: [[Lucifer]], [[Leviathan]], [[Satan]] and [[Belial]]. There are also eight sub-princes: [[Astaroth]], Maggot, [[Asmodeus|Asmodee]], [[Beelzebub]], Oriens, [[Paimon]], Ariton ([[Egin (demon)|Egin]]) and [[Amaymon]]. Under the rule of these there are many lesser demons.\n\n===Le Livre des esperitz===\n{{main article|Livre des Esperitz}}\nWritten in the 15th or 16th century, this grimoire was a likely source for Wierus hierarchy of demons, but while Wierus mentions 69 demons, Le Livre des esperitz has only 46. Wierus omitted, however, the four demons of the cardinal points: Orient, [[Poymon]], [[Aymoymon]] and [[Egin (demon)|Equi]] (see Agrippa's classification) and the three great governors of all the other demons: Lucifer, [[Beezlebub]] and Satan.<ref>[http://medievales.revues.org/1019 ''Le Livre des esperitz'']</ref>\n\n===The Munich Manual of Demonic Magic===\n{{main article|Munich Manual of Demonic Magic}}\nWritten in the 15th century, this manual includes a list of eleven demons.<ref>[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0003/bsb00037155/images/index.html?id=00037155&groesser=&fip=qrseayaxdsydsdaseneayaenewqsdasen&no=137&seite=133 ''Munich Manual of Demonic Magic'' pages 130 to 133]</ref>\n\n===Fasciculus Rerum Geomanticarum===\nWritten in 1494, this grimoire contains a list of 37 demons.<ref>[http://teca.bmlonline.it/ImageViewer/servlet/ImageViewer?idr=TECA0001046610#page/611 ''Fasciculus Rerum Geomanticarum'' pages 611 to 628]</ref>\n\n===Le Dragon Rouge (or Grand Grimoire)===\n{{main article|Grand Grimoire}}\nLike many works of mystical nature, ''Le Dragon Rouge'' (or the ''Red Dragon'') claims to come from Solomon and his priests and is said to be published in 1517 by Alibeck the Egyptian. However, it was most likely written in France in the 18th century.\n\nThe grimoire details the different hosts of hell and their powers, describing how to enter a pact with them to attain the magicians' goals.

The ''Lesser Key of Solomon'' contains detailed descriptions of [[spirit]]s and the [[conjuration]]s needed to invoke and oblige them to do the will of the conjurer (referred to as the \"exorcist\"). It details the protective signs and rituals to be performed, the actions necessary to prevent the spirits from gaining control, the preparations prior to the [[invocation]]s, and instructions on how to make the necessary instruments for the execution of these [[ritual]]s.\n\nThe author of ''The Lesser Key of Solomon'' copied ''Pseudomonarchia Daemonum'' almost completely, but added demons' descriptions, their [[Diabolical signature|seals]] and details.\n\n====The Ars Goetia====\n{{See also|List of demons in the Ars Goetia}}\n\n''[[Goetia#The Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia]]'' is the first section of ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'', containing [[List of demons in the Ars Goetia|descriptions of the seventy-two demons]] that [[King Solomon]] is said to have [[evocation|evoked]] and confined in a bronze vessel sealed by [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] symbols, and that he obliged to work for him.\n\nThe ''Ars Goetia'' assigns a rank and a title of nobility to each member of the infernal hierarchy, and gives the demons \"signs they have to pay allegiance to\", or [[Diabolical signature|seals]].\n\n===Dictionnaire Infernal===\n{{Main article|Dictionnaire Infernal}}\n\nThe ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' ({{lang-en|Infernal Dictionary}}) is a book on [[demonology]], organised in [[hell]]ish [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It was written by [[Collin de Plancy|Jacques Auguste Simon Collin de Plancy]] and first published in 1818. There were several editions of the book, but perhaps the most famous is the edition of 1863, in which sixty-nine illustrations were added to the book. These illustrations are drawings which depict the descriptions of the appearance of a number of demons. Many of these images were later used in [[S. L. MacGregor Mathers]]'s edition of ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' though some of the images were removed.\n\nThe book was first published in 1818 and then divided into two volumes, with six reprints and many changes between 1818 and 1863. This book attempts to provide an account of all the knowledge concerning superstitions and [[demonology]].\n\nDe Plancy presented a hierarchy of demons based in modern European courts:\n* Princes and dignitaries: [[Belzebub]], supreme chief of the empire of hell, founder of the order of the Fly.

[[Mullin]], first valet.\n* Secret expenses: [[Robals]], director of theaters. [[Asmodeus]], superintendent of the gambling houses. [[Nybbas]], grand buffoon. [[Antichrist]], charlatan and necromancer.\n\nAlexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier used some of these names and ranks for the demons who tormented him, in his autobiographical work ''Les farfadets ou Tous les d\u00e9mons ne sont pas de l'autre monde'' (1821).\n\n===The Satanic Bible===\n{{main article|The infernal names}}\nLaVey utilized the symbolism of the Four Crown Princes of Hell in ''The Satanic Bible'', with each chapter of the book being named after each Prince. ''The Book of Satan: The Infernal Diatribe'', ''The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment'', ''The Book of Belial: Mastery of the Earth'', and ''The Book of Leviathan: The Raging Sea''.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=121\u2013140}}  This association was inspired by the demonic hierarchy from ''[[The Book of Abramelin|The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage]]''.\n\n*'''[[Satan]] (Hebrew) \"Lord of the Inferno\":''' \nThe adversary, representing opposition, the element of fire, the direction of the south, and the Sigil of Baphomet during ritual. \n*'''[[Lucifer]] (Roman) \"The Morning Star\":'''\nThe bringer of light, representing pride and enlightenment, the element of air, the direction of the east, and candles during ritual. \n*'''[[Belial]] (Hebrew) \"Without a Master\":'''\nThe baseness of the earth, independence and self-sufficiency, the element of earth, the direction of the north, and the sword during ritual. \n*'''[[Leviathan]] (Hebrew) \"Serpent of the Abyss\":''' \nThe great dragon, representing primal secrecy, the element of water, the direction of the west, and the chalice during ritual.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Archdemon]] vs. [[Archangel]]\n* [[Christian demonology]]\n* [[Exorcism]]\n* [[Hierarchy of Angels]]\n* [[List of theological demons]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Demons| ]]\n[[Category:Classification systems by subject|Demons]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=July 2016}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2016}}\n{{undue weight|date=July 2016}}\n}}\n[[Image:Schongauer Anthony.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[The Temptation of St Anthony (Schongauer)|The Temptation of St. Anthony]]'' by [[Martin Schongauer]]]]\nThere have been various attempts throughout history by [[theologian]] scholars in the '''classification of Christian demons''' for the purpose of understanding the biblical and [[myth|mythological context]] of adversarial spirits. Theologians have written dissertations in [[Christian demonology]], classical [[occultism]], [[classical mythology]] and [[Renaissance magic]] to clarify the connections between these spirits and their influence in various cultures. The study of [[demonology]] was historically used to understand morality, behavioral tendencies, and has even been used as symbolism to relay anecdotal tales in with which they lure people into temptation and may also include the angels or [[saint]]s that were believed to have been their adversaries; an idea which derived from the Biblical battle between the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and Piccalo in The [[Book of Revelation]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#12:7|12:7-9]]) describing a [[war in heaven]] which resulted in Satan and his angels being expelled from Heaven. The classifications of these fallen angels are based on many other characteristics as well, such as behaviors that caused their fall from heaven, physical appearances or the methods that were used to torment people, cause maladies, or elicit dreams, emotions, etc. Most authors who wrote theological dissertations on the subject either truly believed in the existence of infernal spirits, or wrote as a philosophical guide to understanding an ancient perspective of behavior and morality in folklore and religious themes.\n\n==Classification by domain==  \nIn the study of demonology, infernal spirits are often classified by domain, meaning their attribution to a specified sphere of activity or knowledge. Oftentimes this means a specific moral sin or questionable behavior to which some people are prone. They may even be attributed to the methods they cause trouble to humans by the use of certain misfortunes, maladies, or addictions. In general, the domain of a demon is reflected on whatever authority they hold in their interaction with mankind. This idea holds a similar connotation to the gods of classical mythology as each have their own tasks and abilities according to their authority and each interact with mankind in their own unique way. It can be noted that according to each author listed below, the domain of each demon is varied greatly on either preference or perspective. It can also be seen that each author chooses and classifies demons differently based on the author's personal set of beliefs or politics.\n\n===The Testament of Solomon===\n{{main article|Testament of Solomon}}\nThe ''Testament of Solomon'' is an [[pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphical]] work, purportedly written by King [[Solomon]], in which the author mostly describes particular [[demon]]s whom he enslaved to help build the [[Solomon's Temple|temple]], the questions he put to them about their deeds and how they could be thwarted, and their answers, which provide a kind of self-help manual against demonic activity. The date is very dubious, though it is considered the oldest surviving work particularly concerned with individual demons.<ref>[http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/testamen.htm ''The Testament of Solomon''], trans.

It seems that Spina was inspired by several legends and stories. The drudes belong to [[German folklore]].  Familiars, goblins, and other mischievous demons belong to the folklore of most European countries.\n\nThe belief in incubi and succubi (and their ability to procreate) seem to have inspired the seventh category, but it could also have been inspired in the Talmudic legend of demons having sexual intercourse with mortal women (see also [[Mastema]]).\n\nThe visions of tempting demons that some early (and not so early) saints had, perhaps inspired the ninth category (e.g. the visions of [[Anthony the Great]]).\n\nThe idea of old women attending Sabbaths was common during the European [[Middle Age]] and [[Renaissance]], and Spina mentioned it before the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]].''\n\n===Agrippa's classification of demons===\nIn ''De occulta philosophia'' (1509-1510), [[Cornelius Agrippa]] proposed several classifications for demons. One is based in the number four and the cardinal points, with the ruling demons being Oriens (East), [[Paimon|Paymon]] (west), [[Egin (demon)|Egyn]] (North) and [[Amaymon]] (South). The same four demons appear in the ''Semiphoras and Schemhamforas''.<ref>[http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agrippa2.htm Cornelius Agrippa, ''De occulta philosophia'']</ref><ref>[http://www.esotericarchives.com/moses/67moses2.htm#appendix3 The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]</ref>\nAnother classification, based in the number nine, has the following orders of demons: False spirits, Spirits of lying, Vessels of iniquity, Avengers of wickedness, Jugglers, Airy powers, Furies sowing mischief, Sifters or triers, Tempters or ensnarers (See Barrett's classification below).\n\n===Binsfeld's classification of demons===\n[[Peter Binsfeld]] prepared a classification of demons in 1589 known as the Princes of Hell. His demon classification was, like the earlier English ''Lanterne of Light'', based on the [[seven deadly sins]], though it differed slightly from the English text.\n* 1. [[Lucifer]]: Pride\n* 2. [[Mammon]]: Greed\n* 3. [[Asmodeus]]: Lust\n* 4. [[Leviathan]]: Envy\n* 5. [[Beelzebub]]: Gluttony\n* 6. [[Satan]]: Wrath\n* 7.

Within 3 short books James wrote a dissertation in the form of a philosophical play, making arguments and comparisons between magic, sorcery and witchcraft but wrote also his classifications of demons into 4 sections. His classification were not based on separate demonic entities with their names, ranks, or titles but rather categorized them based on 4 methods used by any given devil to cause mischief or torment on a living individual or a deceased corpse. The purpose was to relay the belief that spirits caused maladies and that magic was possible only through demonic influence. He further quotes previous authors who state that each devil has the ability to appear in diverse shapes or forms for varying arrays of purposes as well. In his description of them, he relates that demons are under the direct supervision of God and are unable to act without permission, further illustrating how demonic forces are used as a ''\"Rod of Correction\"'' when men stray from the will of God and may be commissioned by witches, or magicians to conduct acts of ill will against others but will ultimately only conduct works that will end in the further glorification of God despite their attempts to do otherwise.<ref>{{cite book|last1=King James|title=Daemonologie.

This classification is based on the [[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchies]], according to the sins the devil tempts one to commit, and includes the demons' adversaries (who suffered that temptation without falling).\n\nNote that many demons' names are exclusively French or unknown in other catalogs. St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist are the two St. Johns to whom Michaelis refers. The other saints are cited only by their name without making clear, i.e., which Francis is mentioned (of Assisi?).\n\n====First hierarchy====\nThe first hierarchy includes angels that were [[Seraphim]], [[Cherubim]] and [[Thrones]].\n* [[Beelzebub]] was a prince of the Seraphim, just below Lucifer. Beelzebub, along with Lucifer and [[Leviathan]], were the first three angels to fall. He tempts men with pride and is opposed by St. [[Francis of Assisi]].\n* [[Leviathan]] was also a prince of the Seraphim who tempts people to give into heresy, and is opposed by [[St. Peter]].\n* [[Asmodeus]] was also a prince of the Seraphim, burning with desire to tempt men into wantonness. He is opposed by St. [[John the Baptist]].\n* [[Berith (demon)|Berith]] was a prince of the Cherubim. He tempts men to commit homicide, and to be quarrelsome, contentious, and blasphemous. He is opposed by [[St. Barnabas]].\n* [[Astaroth]] was a prince of Thrones, who tempts men to be lazy and is opposed by [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]].\n* [[Verrine (demon)|Verrine]] was also a prince of Thrones, just below Astaroth. He tempts men with impatience and is opposed by St. Dominic.\n* [[Gressil]] was the third prince of Thrones, who tempts men with impurity and is opposed by St. Bernard.\n* [[Soneillon]] was the fourth prince of Thrones, who tempts men to hate and is opposed by St. Stephen.<ref>\"les demons estans interrogez respondirent qu'ils estoient trois au corps de Louyse, y estans par le moyen d'vn malefice, & que le premier d'eux se nommoit Verrine, l'autre Gresil, & le dernier Sonneillon, & que tous estoient du troisiesme ordre, s\u00e7auoir au rang des Throsnes.\" (Histoire admirable de la possession et conversion d'vne penitente [] exorcisee [] soubs l'authorit\u00e9 du R.P.

He tempts men with hardness of heart and is opposed by St. Vincent and [[Vincent Ferrer]].\n* Carnivale was also a prince of Powers. He tempts men to obscenity and shamelessness, and is opposed by [[John the Evangelist]].\n* Oeillet was a prince of Dominions. He tempts men to break the vow of poverty and is opposed by St. Martin.\n* [[Rosier (demon)|Rosier]] was the second in the order of Dominions. He tempts men against sexual purity and is opposed by St. Basil.\n* [[Belial|Belias]] was the prince of Virtues. He tempts men with arrogance and women to be vain, raise wonton children, and gossip during mass. He is opposed by St. Francis de Paul.\n\n====Third hierarchy====\nThe third hierarchy includes Principalities, Archangels, and Angels.\n* Verrier was the prince of Principalities. He tempts men against the vow of obedience and is opposed by St. Bernard.\n* Olivier was the prince of the Archangels. He tempts men with cruelty and mercilessness toward the poor and is opposed by St. Lawrence.\n* Luvart was prince of Angels. At the time of Michaelis's writing, Luvart was believed to be in the body of a Sister Madeleine.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology''.  Rossell Hope Robbins (1912).  Bonanza Books.

These offices are usually elaborated in several [[grimoire]]s which determines their authority in hell or abilities. Demons categorized by office are often depicted in a militant hierarchy, in which a general may hold command over some designated legion for a specialized function which they may trouble men. Other theologians have determined the classification of a spirit's office depending on the times or locations which they roam the Earth.\n\n===''The Book of Abramelin''===\n''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'', possibly written in the 14th or 15th century, lists four princes of the demons: [[Lucifer]], [[Leviathan]], [[Satan]] and [[Belial]]. There are also eight sub-princes: [[Astaroth]], Maggot, [[Asmodeus|Asmodee]], [[Beelzebub]], Oriens, [[Paimon]], Ariton ([[Egin (demon)|Egin]]) and [[Amaymon]]. Under the rule of these there are many lesser demons.\n\n===Le Livre des esperitz===\n{{main article|Livre des Esperitz}}\nWritten in the 15th or 16th century, this grimoire was a likely source for Wierus hierarchy of demons, but while Wierus mentions 69 demons, Le Livre des esperitz has only 46.

However, it was most likely written in France in the 18th century.\n\nThe grimoire details the different hosts of hell and their powers, describing how to enter a pact with them to attain the magicians' goals.

The ''Lesser Key of Solomon'' contains detailed descriptions of [[spirit]]s and the [[conjuration]]s needed to invoke and oblige them to do the will of the conjurer (referred to as the \"exorcist\"). It details the protective signs and rituals to be performed, the actions necessary to prevent the spirits from gaining control, the preparations prior to the [[invocation]]s, and instructions on how to make the necessary instruments for the execution of these [[ritual]]s.\n\nThe author of ''The Lesser Key of Solomon'' copied ''Pseudomonarchia Daemonum'' almost completely, but added demons' descriptions, their [[Diabolical signature|seals]] and details.\n\n====The Ars Goetia====\n{{See also|List of demons in the Ars Goetia}}\n\n''[[Goetia#The Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia]]'' is the first section of ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'', containing [[List of demons in the Ars Goetia|descriptions of the seventy-two demons]] that [[King Solomon]] is said to have [[evocation|evoked]] and confined in a bronze vessel sealed by [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] symbols, and that he obliged to work for him.\n\nThe ''Ars Goetia'' assigns a rank and a title of nobility to each member of the infernal hierarchy, and gives the demons \"signs they have to pay allegiance to\", or [[Diabolical signature|seals]].\n\n===Dictionnaire Infernal===\n{{Main article|Dictionnaire Infernal}}\n\nThe ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' ({{lang-en|Infernal Dictionary}}) is a book on [[demonology]], organised in [[hell]]ish [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It was written by [[Collin de Plancy|Jacques Auguste Simon Collin de Plancy]] and first published in 1818. There were several editions of the book, but perhaps the most famous is the edition of 1863, in which sixty-nine illustrations were added to the book. These illustrations are drawings which depict the descriptions of the appearance of a number of demons. Many of these images were later used in [[S. L. MacGregor Mathers]]'s edition of ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' though some of the images were removed.\n\nThe book was first published in 1818 and then divided into two volumes, with six reprints and many changes between 1818 and 1863. This book attempts to provide an account of all the knowledge concerning superstitions and [[demonology]].\n\nDe Plancy presented a hierarchy of demons based in modern European courts:\n* Princes and dignitaries: [[Belzebub]], supreme chief of the empire of hell, founder of the order of the Fly.
