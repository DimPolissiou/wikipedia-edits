The series consists of nine installments to date.\n\nThe series focuses on the titular [[Tomie Kawakami]], a beautiful young girl identified by a mole under her left eye, who drives her stricken admirers to madness, often resulting in her own death. However, due to her ability of [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], she comes back to life to terrorize her killers.\n\nEach cell of her body has the ability to generate into a full grown independent body, causing several copies of her to be created after each of her deaths. It is unknown how many copies of Tomie exist in the films' universe although in the most recent movie, ''[[Tomie Unlimited]]'', Tomie is shown walking through the streets of Japan, with most of the women she passes by also being Tomie.<ref name=\"Tomie\">{{Cite web |url=http://diversejapan.com/2012/02/21/dvd-review-tomie-unlimited-a-j-horror-film-by-noboru-iguchi/ |title= TOMIE Unlimited \u2013 A J-Horror Film By Noboru Iguchi |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate= 2013-07-21}}</ref> The films share no direct storyline connections, all focusing on different Tomies and their stories, except for [[Tomie (film)|the first installment]] and 2005's ''[[Tomie: Beginning]]''.\n\nJunji Ito has expressed his support for the films, often attending premieres and even personally picking out the actress [[Miho Kanno]] for the role of Tomie in the first film and coaching her for the audition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinematopics.com/cinema/c_report/index3.php?number=216 |title= \u30c9\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u7dba\u9e97\u306a\u5bcc\u6c5f\u3092\u9280\u5e55\u3067\u898b\u305b\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\uff01\u300e\u5bcc\u6c5f\u3000\u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\uff5e\u7981\u65ad\u306e\u679c\u5b9f\uff5e\u300f |date=2002-06-29 |accessdate= 2013-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/62575/important-importables-10-japanese-horror-movies-animes-enjoy-on-halloween/ |title= Important Importables |date=2002-06-29 |accessdate= 2010-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Tomie'' (1998)===\n{{main|Tomie (film)}}\nThe film opens with the police investigating the murder of high school girl Tomie Kawakami ([[Miho Kanno]]). They learn that in the months following the crime, nine students and one teacher have either committed suicide or gone insane. The detective (Tomoro Taguchi) assigned to the case learns that three years prior another Tomie Kawakami was murdered in rural Gifu prefecture. Other slain Tomie Kawakami's are discovered stretching all the way back to the 1860s, right when Japan began to modernize. The detective tracks down one of Tomie's classmates called Tsukiko Izumisawa ([[Mami Nakamura]]), an art student who is being treated for amnesia. She has absolutely no memory of the three-month period around Tomie's death. Meanwhile, Tsukiko's neighbor (Kota Kusano) is rearing a peculiar baby-like creature. Over the span of a couple weeks, it grows into a beautiful teenaged girl with orange eyes responding to the name of Tomie Kawakami.\n\nSoon afterwards Tomie begins seducing Tsukiko's boyfriend Yuichi (Kouta Kusano). Meanwhile, Tsukiko enters her new neighbor's apartment to investigate. Upon discovering her friend's dead body, she is attacked by her landlord and passes out due to asphyxiation. She wakes up in her psychiatrist's office and encounters Tomie. Tomie starts emotionally abusing Tsukiko and tries feeding her live cockroaches. She then begins taking group [[selfie]]s with her. Soon thereafter, Tsukiko's boyfriend murders Tomie. As they go bury Tomie's headless body in the woods, she comes back to life and Tsukiko runs off further into the woods and finds herself on a boat dock. Tomie then appears once again, now fully regenerated, and kisses Tsukiko on the lips. They both laugh as Tsukiko lights a flare and sets Tomie on fire.\n\nTsukiko is now shown leading a normal life, still taking photographs and being interested in art. One day as she goes to develop a picture she took of herself, she notices a mole under her left eye she didn't have before; the same kind of mole Tomie had. Tsukiko then looks at herself in the mirror in shock as Tomie appears, smiling.\n\n===''Tomie: Another Face'' (1999)===\n{{main|Tomie: Another Face}}\nAn anthology TV series consisting of three episodes was released in 1999. The series was later re-edited and released as a feature film. In the first segment, Tomie ([[Runa Nagai]]) is introduced as a high school student whose body has just been found on the street with several piles of garbage. She comes back to reunite with her former boyfriend, whose ex-girlfriend is considering starting over with as he had previously left her for Tomie. Meanwhile, a man wearing a trench coat and an eye patch is following Tomie and photographing her. The ex-girlfriend exposes Tomie's true nature on the school's rooftop to the boyfriend and in the end, Tomie is thrown from the roof. The two go to bury her in the woods in a deep grave and begin making plans to conceal their work, but as they walk to school in the morning Tomie is miraculously there to confront them.\n\nThe second episode focuses on a photographer who has lost his passion for photography but regains it when he finds Tomie, this time a model/dancer of a sort at a bar. She resembles the girl from his past who gave him that passion, and proceeds to take several photos of her with her permission. The man with the eye patch is still following Tomie during the photoshoots. While Tomie is sleeping in the photographer's bed, he develops the photographs only to find that each one has two faces: Tomie's face and a ghoul's face nearby. Convinced it is not his lens, he tells Tomie this and she tells him to kill her to prove she is not a ghost. If she was a ghost, she could not die. Naturally, she does die, but when the photographer is transporting her body in his car she comes back to life and scares him out of the car. His running takes him to the place where he saw the girl from his past, and he discovers that both are Tomie when the previously dead Tomie appears behind him. He falls to his death from the cliff and the previously dead Tomie stands at his body, grinning and making a [[V sign]] while the Tomie from his past takes their picture.\n\nThe final episode has Tomie as a young woman likely in her early to mid-20s, about to be proposed to by her boyfriend. She is later nearly attacked by the man with the eye patch and sends her boyfriend to kill this man in order to prove his love for her. During his showdown with the man, the boyfriend is tasered into submission and we find out the trench coat wearing man, named Oota, is a former coroner for the police department, and Tomie was one of the bodies he had to perform an autopsy on. She stabbed his eye out in the process and crawled away. Oota shows the boyfriend several other crime scene photographs; all are of Tomie, killed in various places and ways. For losing Tomie's body he was fired, and his wife left him and took their children. For ruining his life, Oota seeks a way to kill Tomie once and for all. He tells the boyfriend to call him if he also seeks a way to kill Tomie. The boyfriend later wakes up in a park, with Tomie asking him where he's been. After finding out he didn't kill Oota, Tomie throws his engagement ring on the ground and walks away. We see the boyfriend take out his knife and follow Tomie. Later, he contacts Oota and brings Tomie's body to an incinerator where Oota is waiting. Tomie's body lies in the back of his van but she is not dead - the boyfriend says he could never kill her. Oota manages to get her body into the incinerator and burns it successfully, but her ashes soon gather together and create her face in the air before Oota. She tells him she will never die and that every single one of her ashes will become a new Tomie.\n\n===''Tomie: Replay'' (2000)===\n{{main|Tomie: Replay}}\n''Tomie: Replay'' contains elements of the manga chapter ''Basement''. The film begins with a six-year-old girl being rushed into a hospital ER with an unusually distended stomach. Doctors begin to operate and find a disembodied head, Tomie's head, alive and growing inside the girl's belly. The head is placed in a tank of alkaline solution in the basement of the hospital for further observation. Soon after, five of the hospital workers present during the operation mysteriously leave the hospital or disappear entirely, including hospital Director Morita.\n\nMeanwhile, a few nights later, Takeshi visits his friend Fumihito, who is recovering from some ailment in his hospital room. While visiting, Takeshi is confronted by a naked Tomie (Mai Hosho), now fully grown and escaped from the basement, who asks him to get her out of there. Takeshi takes Tomie to his apartment, and leaves Fumihito by himself, with no explanation. Later, Fumihito calls Takeshi to find out why he left. Takeshi reacts very defensively and irrationally, telling Fumihito that \"Tomie belongs to me,\" already under Tomie's evil and seductive influence.\n\nThe next morning, Yumi, Director Morita's daughter, visits the hospital in search of her father, missing since the operation. She meets Dr. Tachibana, the only doctor present during the young girl's operation who hasn't yet left the hospital. Tachibana gives Yumi a journal recently written by her father, and soon after giving it to her he kills himself. Through the journal we learn that during the operation, Director Morita and another doctor were accidentally infected with Tomie's blood, and that through that blood Tomie is regenerating within the doctors, taking over their bodies and driving them mad. Yumi reads in her father's journal about him wanting to kill a girl named \"Tomie\".\n\nLater, Yumi and Fumihito meet at a party and realize they are both looking for a girl named \"Tomie\". They join forces to find out what happened to Yumi's father, and to Fumihito's friend.\n\nThe next day, Yumi visits the family of the six-year-old girl who had had the operation. She learns that prior to that operation, the girl had received a kidney transplant from a girl named \"Tomie\". From this kidney, Tomie had begun to regenerate inside the girl's body. Meanwhile, Fumihito visits his friend Takeshi, who had gone mad after killing and decapitating Tomie in a fit of jealousy, then watching her come back to life, regenerating a new head. Takeshi soon after is committed to a mental hospital, and Fumihito becomes Tomie's new prey.\n\nThat night Yumi has a short and strange run-in with her missing father, during which he babbles about needing to kill Tomie. The following day his dead body is discovered in the hospital basement, bloated and deformed. At his funeral Yumi receives a note from Tomie, asking to meet her that night at the hospital, seemingly for a final showdown. \n\nYumi arrives at the hospital to find Tomie there to taunt her, and Fumihito, now under Tomie's spell, there apparently to kill her.  At the last minute Fumihito decides to kill Tomie instead, chopping off her head and burning the remains. Yumi and Fumihito leave the hospital in relief.\n\n===''Tomie: Re-birth'' (2001)===\n{{main|Tomie: Re-birth}}\nAn artist named Hideo is painting his girlfriend Tomie ([[Miki Sakai]]), but she dismisses it as a poor painting and he kills her in a jealous rage with an art knife and his two friends Shunsuke and Takumi help him bury her. When the three friends are at a party Tomie shows up and the artist kills himself in the bathroom. Tomie latches onto Shunsuke and his mother kills Tomie and they cut her up together in an unnatural ecstasy. They then burn her head, which has already started to regenerate and has some crude limbs for locomotion. The portrait of Tomie allows for her regeneration, as her supernatural blood mixed with the pigments. Takumi's girlfriend Hitomi gets possessed by Tomie, in a rather viral fashion. In a fit of jealousy, the two Tomies try to eliminate the other. \n\nHitomi doesn't want to become a monster, and so they decide to commit suicide. However, when at a waterfall, about to commit suicide, Tomie's head grows on the side of Hitomi's neck next to her head. They all die and then Takumi's sister comes and throws flowers into the water. A small facial mole can be seen directly beneath the sister's left eye, suggesting that, because Takumi gave her the portrait of Tomie, she was also possessed by her. Thus, the sister is the newest Tomie.\n\n===''Tomie: Forbidden Fruit'' (2002)===\n{{main|Tomie: Forbidden Fruit}}\nTomie Hashimoto ([[Aoi Miyazaki]]) is a dreamy teen who writes homo-erotic horror fiction in which she imagines herself as Ann Bathory, a vampire (borrowing from the murderous historical figure [[Elizabeth Bathory]]). Introspective and lonely, she is picked on and bullied by her classmates at school, and lives alone with her loving, but distant widower father, Kazuhiko Hashimoto. One day, while admiring an ornate, jewel encrusted [[cross necklace]] in an antiquities shop, Tomie meets a strange, beautiful girl (Nozomi Ando) with a mole under her left eye. The mysterious stranger says her name is Tomie Kawakami. The girls become fast friends (with heavy lesbian undertones), but it soon becomes clear that theirs was not a chance meeting. Tomie Kawakami has an agenda, and it involves Kazuhiko.\n\nIt is revealed Kazuhiko was involved in a relationship with Tomie many years ago which resulted in her being murdered. However, Kazuhiko was still obsessed with Tomie and even named his own daughter after her. Tomie is back to terrorize his family and tries to convince Kazuhiko to murder his daughter. Kazuhiko ends up murdering and decapitating the monster Tomie, and throws her head into a nearby river. His daughter, Tomie H. discovers the talking head and nurses Tomie K. back to health as she regenerates but ends up killing her. She and her father ultimately end up freezing Tomie into a block of ice to prevent her from regenerating and coming back to life, but after hearing the frozen Tomie's pleas and cries Kazuhiko ends up breaking the block of ice and setting her free. Tomie K. then attacks  Tomie H. but is defeated, which results in Kazuhiko locking his daughter into a freezer room. The morning after, Tomie H. is discovered by a worker from the ice sculpture company. Tomie Hashimoto is now shown living alone, with her father missing, albeit thankful because she believes he tried to save her from the other Tomie, which is the reason he teamed up with her and abandoned his daughter.\n\nTomie then goes to her room and continues to write her fanfiction. She writes: \"Ann and Mary are friends again, there'll be no issues this time. Ann will raise her to be a real friend, a friend whom she can depend on\". Tomie then opens her desk drawer and looks at a dismembered, regenerating ear. She mutters the words \"...a real friend\".\n\n===''Tomie: Beginning'' (2005)===\n{{main|Tomie: Beginning}}\nThis straight-to-video movie is a prequel to the rest of the series, shot on HD, and based on the first Tomie manga by Junji Ito. It deals with the chain of events that occurred right before the first film takes place. Tomie ([[Rio Matsumoto]]) shows up as a transfer student at a high school, quickly enchanting all the males, and raising the ire of the females.  As is often the case in the Tomie films, she fixates on one solitary girl whom she befriends, with overt lesbian overtones. She displays all of her typical powers, and it isn't long before the murders and madness begin.  In this movie we are introduced to the teacher who promises to kill her no matter how many times he has to do the \"favor\" as well as the eye-patch-wearing boy of the first movie in the series.\n\n===''Tomie: Revenge'' (2005)===\n{{main|Tomie: Revenge}}\nAnother home-video release shot on HD, this one partly based on the Tomie manga \"Revenge\" by Junji Ito. This time round, Tomie is played by Anri Ban. The story revolves around a young doctor (Hisako Shirata), and an unidentified naked woman she runs down on the road one night. In her search for the wounded girl (who has a mole under her left eye) the doctor ends up in an abandoned house filled with bodies, madmen and an unconscious girl. Surely Tomie is not too far away...\n\n===''Tomie vs Tomie ''(2007)===\n{{main|Tomie vs Tomie}}\nPartially based on the manga \"The Gathering.\"  A young man with a past begins work in a factory, where he attracts the amorous attention of a mysterious woman who lurks behind the scenes. He is a relatively unique young man, perhaps a genetic one-off, in that he feels no particular attraction to Tomie.  This of course intrigues Tomie, and ''she'' begins to become obsessed with ''him''.  Soon, he is caught in a vicious struggle between two rival Tomies. And neither Tomie will die.\n\n===''Tomie Unlimited'' (2011)===\n{{main|Tomie: Unlimited}}\n\nTsukiko Izumikawa (Moe Arai) is a member of the photography club in high school. On her way home with friend Yoshie (Aika Ota), Tsukiko runs into her older sister Tomie (Miu Nakamura) who goes to the same high school. Tomie is also with Toshio (Kensuke Owada) - a guy that Tsukiko has a secret crush on. Tsukiko is consumed with fierce jealousy over her sister, but at the same time is intoxicated with Tomie's beauty. Tsukiko keeps pressing the trigger on her camera. At that time Tomie tells her sister that she knows what she is feeling. When Tsukiko stops taking pictures, Tomie is crushed by a steel cross that falls from a building under construction, killing her in the process.\n\nOne year later, Tsukiko still suffers by recurring nightmares over her sister's death. Slowly, her daily life returns to some sense of normality. On Tomie's 18th birthday, her parents and Tsukiko stand around a birthday cake in her honor. At that time someone knocks on their door. Tomie stands in the doorway with her beauty shining even more brightly. Her parents are delighted to see Tomie and welcomes her back in joyful tears. Meanwhile, Tsukiko still jealous stands there unable to believe what is transpiring. Tomie manages to get her father Izumisawa (Kouichi Ohori) to whip Tsukiko across the back with a steam iron cable as punishment.\n\nTomie's behavior starts becoming increasingly bizarre and abnormal as she shows Tsukiko the scar on her neck that begins to evolve into a talking tumor. Tsukiko was fearful of Tomie's horrible appearance and she calls Tomie a \"monster\". Offended, Tomie decides to leave but is prevented from doing so when her father stabs and kills her into the pieces with a butcher knife.\n\nThe next morning, Tsukiko witnesses her mother Kimiko (Maiko Kawakami) and Izumisawa dismembering Tomie's body in the bathroom. Kimiko then disposes of Tomie's head by throwing it away in the trash bin and goes to prepare Tsukiko's school lunch, accidentally dropping several chunks of Tomie's flesh and hair in it. At school, Tsukiko notices a girl who looks exactly like her dead sister walk into class. Later on, during lunch break, Tsukiko opens her lunch pack and sees several miniature Tomie heads in it. She runs off and throws the lunch pack into the trash. When her friend Yoshie goes to look for Tsukiko, she hears noises in the trash and leans over to investigate. Suddenly, the miniature Tomie heads appear and strangle Yoshie with their abnormally long tongues, killing her.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, Tomie's head rises from the trash bin and convinces her father to kill his wife and feed her to her. Back at school, Tsukiko encounters Yoshie with a tumor on her neck and runs off in panic. When Yoshie enters the Judo club's room while looking for Tsukiko, she is decapitated by the members who mistook her head for the tumor's. Her headless body comes back to life and starts chasing the Judo club members. Tsukiko then walks into Toshio stabbing Tomie's body, and a new Tomie forms out of the blood and begins kissing Toshio. Tsukiko kills Toshio and runs off into a locker room and encounters several versions of Tomie.\n\nJust as she is about to be cornered by the Tomies, she wakes up in her bed. Her parents inform her that she is an only child and that she never had a sister. Tsukiko sighs in relief, believing she just had a bad nightmare which proves to be false when her father starts eating hair and her mother's head appears to be upside down. Her mother chases her with a knife but is attacked by a carnivorous centipede made out of Tomie's heads. Tsukiko runs upstairs and encounters Toshio and Yoshie who tell her that they never liked her and were pretending to be her friends all along. She pushes them down the stairs and they are both attacked by the centipedes. Tsukiko then encounters a grotesque, freakish, giant Tomie head in her living room, and after a brief conversation the Tomie centipedes begin crawling over her. \n\nFinally, Tsukiko is shown walking out of the house, resembling Tomie. As she walks through the streets of Japan, she observes other women she passes by, many of them also being Tomie. She walks up to a man, smiling, and is then shown being murdered by him in an apartment. Lying on the floor, she looks at a mirror and Tomie's reflection asks her \"Are you happy now, Tsukiko?\"\n\n===Future===\nIn July 2019, [[Alexandre Aja]] was announced to be developing a [[Web television|web television series]] adaptation of ''Tomie'' for [[Quibi]], in conjunction with [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[Universal Content Productions]], with [[David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick]] serving as writer and executive producer, with Hiroki Shirota on board as co-producer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Squires|first1=John|title=Alexandre Aja Directing Adaptation of Junji Ito\u2019s \u2018Tomie\u2019 for Quibi!|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3574845/alexandre-aja-directing-adaptation-junji-itos-tomie-quibi/|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=July 24, 2019|date=July 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:99%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n'''{{center|List indicator(s)}}'''\n* This table shows the characters and the actors who have portrayed them throughout the franchise.\n* A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film, or that the character's presence in the film has not yet been announced.\n* A {{note label|young|Y|}} indicates an appearance as a younger version of a pre-existing character.\n* A {{note label|photo|P|}} indicates a photographic appearance only.\n* A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a vocal appearance only.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:14%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"11\" | Films\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9%;\" | [[Junji Ito Collection#Release|{{small|''Junji Ito Collection:''}}<br>OVA \u2013 ''Tomie'']]\n|-\n! style=\"width:8.5%;\" | [[Tomie (film)|''Tomie'']]\n! style=\"width:9.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Another Face|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Another Face'']]\n! style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Replay|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Replay'']]\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Re-birth|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Re-birth'']]\n! style=\"width:11%;\" | [[Tomie: Forbidden Fruit|''{{small|Tomie:<br>The Final Chapter \u2013}}<br>Forbidden Fruit'']]\n! style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Beginning|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Beginning'']]\n! style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Revenge|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Revenge'']]\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1%;\" | [[Tomie vs Tomie|''Tomie vs. Tomie'']]\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | ''[[Tomie Unlimited]]''\n|-\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''1998'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''1999'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2000'''}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2001'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2002'''}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2005'''}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2007'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2011'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2018'''}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"13\" style=\"background:silver;\"| <span style=\"color: black;\">Main Characters</span>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Tomie Kawakami]]\n| [[Miho Kanno]]\n| Runa Nagai\n| Mai H\u014dsh\u014d\n| colspan=\"2\" | [[Miki Sakai]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Nozomi And\u00f4\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Rio Matsumoto]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Anri Ban\n| Y\u00fb Abiru\n| Emiko Matsuoka\n| Miu Nakamura{{efn|In ''[[Tomie Unlimited]]'', Tsukiko (as Tomie) is shown walking through the streets of Japan, with most of the women she passes by also being Tomie, with all previous Tomie actresses reprising their roles.<ref name=\"Tomie\" />}}\n| [[Rie Suegara]]{{ref|voice|V|}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Mami Nakamura]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | Miho Kanno{{ref|photo|P|}}\n| Kumiko End\u00f4\n| [[Mia Murano]]\n| Chika Arakawa{{ref|young|Y|}}\n| Natsuki Kasa{{ref|young|Y|}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Moe Arai\n| [[Monica Rial]]{{ref|voice|V|}}\n|-\n!

As such, this changing roster of faces has allowed for a range of interpretations and subtle shading to the part, the most popular being [[Miho Kanno]] and [[Miki Sakai]].  Miho Kanno was Junji Ito's own personal choice for the role; he apparently coached her in preparing for her audition, even suggesting she wear Tomie's trademark beauty mark under her left eye.\n\n== Comparison with the source material ==\nThe films manage to recreate the atmosphere of the manga.  Most of the stories occur during the dark of night for its sense of eeriness, and the films generally follow suit.\n\nTomie's sexuality in the films is more ambiguous.  In the manga, Tomie's attitude towards other women seems to range between thinly veiled hostility and outright murderous rage, while the film incarnation is known to seduce women as well as men.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.artport.co.jp/movie/tomie/ Tomie vs Tomie Official Site]\n*[http://www.sarudama.com/japanese_movies/tomie.shtml Review of the First Tomie Movie]\n\n{{Tomie}}\n\n[[Category:Japanese horror films]]\n[[Category:Horror film series]]\n[[Category:Japanese LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Japanese films]]\n[[Category:Tomie]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related horror films]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Tomie'' (film series)}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Tomie\n| image          = Tomie series collection.jpg\n| caption        = DVD set containing the first 5 films.\n| director       = [[Ataru Oikawa]]<br/>Toshir\u014d Inomata<br/>Fujir\u014d Mitsuishi<br/>[[Takashi Shimizu]]<br/> [[Shun Nakahara]]<br/> Tomohiro Kubo<br/>[[Noboru Iguchi]]\n| producer       = Yasuhiko Azuma<br/>Naotada It\u00f4<br/>Yasuhiko Higashi<br/>T\u00f4ru Ishii<br/>Mikihiko Hirata<br/> Gen Sat\u00f4\n| writer         = Ataru Oikawa<br/>Satoru Tamaki<br/>Yoshinobu Fujioka<br/>Tomohiro Kubo<br/>Jun Tsugita<br/> Noboru Iguchi\n| starring       = [[Miho Kanno]]<br/>Runa Nagai<br/>Mai Hosho<br/>Miki Sakai<br/>Nozomi And\u00f4<br/>[[Rio Matsumoto]]<br/>Anri Ban<br/>Yu Abiru<br/>Emiko Matsuoka<br/>Miu Nakamura\n| music          =\n| released       = {{small|'''''Tomie'''''}}<br>March 6, 1999<br>{{small|'''''Tomie: Another Face'''''}}<br>December 26, 1999<br>{{small|'''''Tomie: Replay'''''}}<br>February 11, 2000<br>{{small|'''''Tomie: Re-birth'''''}}<br>March 24, 2001<br>{{small|'''''Tomie: Forbidden Fruit'''''}}<br>June 29, 2002<br>{{small|'''''Tomie: Beginning'''''}}<br>April 9, 2005<br>{{small|'''''Tomie: Revenge'''''}}<br>April 16, 2005<br>{{small|'''''Tomie vs. Tomie'''''}}<br>November 17, 2007<br>{{small|'''''Tomie Unlimited'''''}}<br>May 14, 2011\n| runtime        = 788 minutes\n| distributor    =\n| country        = [[Japan]]\n| language       = [[Japanese language|Japanese]]\n| budget         =\n| gross          =\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Tomie'''''|\u5bcc\u6c5f}} is a [[Japanese horror]] [[film series]] based on [[Junji Ito]]'s [[manga]] of [[Tomie|the same name]]. The series consists of nine installments to date.\n\nThe series focuses on the titular [[Tomie Kawakami]], a beautiful young girl identified by a mole under her left eye, who drives her stricken admirers to madness, often resulting in her own death. However, due to her ability of [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], she comes back to life to terrorize her killers.\n\nEach cell of her body has the ability to generate into a full grown independent body, causing several copies of her to be created after each of her deaths. It is unknown how many copies of Tomie exist in the films' universe although in the most recent movie, ''[[Tomie Unlimited]]'', Tomie is shown walking through the streets of Japan, with most of the women she passes by also being Tomie.<ref name=\"Tomie\">{{Cite web |url=http://diversejapan.com/2012/02/21/dvd-review-tomie-unlimited-a-j-horror-film-by-noboru-iguchi/ |title= TOMIE Unlimited \u2013 A J-Horror Film By Noboru Iguchi |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate= 2013-07-21}}</ref> The films share no direct storyline connections, all focusing on different Tomies and their stories, except for [[Tomie (film)|the first installment]] and 2005's ''[[Tomie: Beginning]]''.\n\nJunji Ito has expressed his support for the films, often attending premieres and even personally picking out the actress [[Miho Kanno]] for the role of Tomie in the first film and coaching her for the audition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinematopics.com/cinema/c_report/index3.php?number=216 |title= \u30c9\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u7dba\u9e97\u306a\u5bcc\u6c5f\u3092\u9280\u5e55\u3067\u898b\u305b\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\uff01\u300e\u5bcc\u6c5f\u3000\u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\uff5e\u7981\u65ad\u306e\u679c\u5b9f\uff5e\u300f |date=2002-06-29 |accessdate= 2013-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/62575/important-importables-10-japanese-horror-movies-animes-enjoy-on-halloween/ |title= Important Importables |date=2002-06-29 |accessdate= 2010-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Tomie'' (1998)===\n{{main|Tomie (film)}}\nThe film opens with the police investigating the murder of high school girl Tomie Kawakami ([[Miho Kanno]]). They learn that in the months following the crime, nine students and one teacher have either committed suicide or gone insane. The detective (Tomoro Taguchi) assigned to the case learns that three years prior another Tomie Kawakami was murdered in rural Gifu prefecture. Other slain Tomie Kawakami's are discovered stretching all the way back to the 1860s, right when Japan began to modernize. The detective tracks down one of Tomie's classmates called Tsukiko Izumisawa ([[Mami Nakamura]]), an art student who is being treated for amnesia. She has absolutely no memory of the three-month period around Tomie's death. Meanwhile, Tsukiko's neighbor (Kota Kusano) is rearing a peculiar baby-like creature. Over the span of a couple weeks, it grows into a beautiful teenaged girl with orange eyes responding to the name of Tomie Kawakami.\n\nSoon afterwards Tomie begins seducing Tsukiko's boyfriend Yuichi (Kouta Kusano). Meanwhile, Tsukiko enters her new neighbor's apartment to investigate. Upon discovering her friend's dead body, she is attacked by her landlord and passes out due to asphyxiation. She wakes up in her psychiatrist's office and encounters Tomie. Tomie starts emotionally abusing Tsukiko and tries feeding her live cockroaches. She then begins taking group [[selfie]]s with her. Soon thereafter, Tsukiko's boyfriend murders Tomie. As they go bury Tomie's headless body in the woods, she comes back to life and Tsukiko runs off further into the woods and finds herself on a boat dock. Tomie then appears once again, now fully regenerated, and kisses Tsukiko on the lips. They both laugh as Tsukiko lights a flare and sets Tomie on fire.\n\nTsukiko is now shown leading a normal life, still taking photographs and being interested in art. One day as she goes to develop a picture she took of herself, she notices a mole under her left eye she didn't have before; the same kind of mole Tomie had. Tsukiko then looks at herself in the mirror in shock as Tomie appears, smiling.\n\n===''Tomie: Another Face'' (1999)===\n{{main|Tomie: Another Face}}\nAn anthology TV series consisting of three episodes was released in 1999. The series was later re-edited and released as a feature film. In the first segment, Tomie ([[Runa Nagai]]) is introduced as a high school student whose body has just been found on the street with several piles of garbage. She comes back to reunite with her former boyfriend, whose ex-girlfriend is considering starting over with as he had previously left her for Tomie. Meanwhile, a man wearing a trench coat and an eye patch is following Tomie and photographing her. The ex-girlfriend exposes Tomie's true nature on the school's rooftop to the boyfriend and in the end, Tomie is thrown from the roof. The two go to bury her in the woods in a deep grave and begin making plans to conceal their work, but as they walk to school in the morning Tomie is miraculously there to confront them.\n\nThe second episode focuses on a photographer who has lost his passion for photography but regains it when he finds Tomie, this time a model/dancer of a sort at a bar. She resembles the girl from his past who gave him that passion, and proceeds to take several photos of her with her permission. The man with the eye patch is still following Tomie during the photoshoots. While Tomie is sleeping in the photographer's bed, he develops the photographs only to find that each one has two faces: Tomie's face and a ghoul's face nearby. Convinced it is not his lens, he tells Tomie this and she tells him to kill her to prove she is not a ghost. If she was a ghost, she could not die. Naturally, she does die, but when the photographer is transporting her body in his car she comes back to life and scares him out of the car. His running takes him to the place where he saw the girl from his past, and he discovers that both are Tomie when the previously dead Tomie appears behind him. He falls to his death from the cliff and the previously dead Tomie stands at his body, grinning and making a [[V sign]] while the Tomie from his past takes their picture.\n\nThe final episode has Tomie as a young woman likely in her early to mid-20s, about to be proposed to by her boyfriend. She is later nearly attacked by the man with the eye patch and sends her boyfriend to kill this man in order to prove his love for her. During his showdown with the man, the boyfriend is tasered into submission and we find out the trench coat wearing man, named Oota, is a former coroner for the police department, and Tomie was one of the bodies he had to perform an autopsy on. She stabbed his eye out in the process and crawled away. Oota shows the boyfriend several other crime scene photographs; all are of Tomie, killed in various places and ways. For losing Tomie's body he was fired, and his wife left him and took their children. For ruining his life, Oota seeks a way to kill Tomie once and for all. He tells the boyfriend to call him if he also seeks a way to kill Tomie. The boyfriend later wakes up in a park, with Tomie asking him where he's been. After finding out he didn't kill Oota, Tomie throws his engagement ring on the ground and walks away. We see the boyfriend take out his knife and follow Tomie. Later, he contacts Oota and brings Tomie's body to an incinerator where Oota is waiting. Tomie's body lies in the back of his van but she is not dead - the boyfriend says he could never kill her. Oota manages to get her body into the incinerator and burns it successfully, but her ashes soon gather together and create her face in the air before Oota. She tells him she will never die and that every single one of her ashes will become a new Tomie.\n\n===''Tomie: Replay'' (2000)===\n{{main|Tomie: Replay}}\n''Tomie: Replay'' contains elements of the manga chapter ''Basement''. The film begins with a six-year-old girl being rushed into a hospital ER with an unusually distended stomach. Doctors begin to operate and find a disembodied head, Tomie's head, alive and growing inside the girl's belly. The head is placed in a tank of alkaline solution in the basement of the hospital for further observation. Soon after, five of the hospital workers present during the operation mysteriously leave the hospital or disappear entirely, including hospital Director Morita.\n\nMeanwhile, a few nights later, Takeshi visits his friend Fumihito, who is recovering from some ailment in his hospital room. While visiting, Takeshi is confronted by a naked Tomie (Mai Hosho), now fully grown and escaped from the basement, who asks him to get her out of there. Takeshi takes Tomie to his apartment, and leaves Fumihito by himself, with no explanation. Later, Fumihito calls Takeshi to find out why he left. Takeshi reacts very defensively and irrationally, telling Fumihito that \"Tomie belongs to me,\" already under Tomie's evil and seductive influence.\n\nThe next morning, Yumi, Director Morita's daughter, visits the hospital in search of her father, missing since the operation. She meets Dr. Tachibana, the only doctor present during the young girl's operation who hasn't yet left the hospital. Tachibana gives Yumi a journal recently written by her father, and soon after giving it to her he kills himself. Through the journal we learn that during the operation, Director Morita and another doctor were accidentally infected with Tomie's blood, and that through that blood Tomie is regenerating within the doctors, taking over their bodies and driving them mad. Yumi reads in her father's journal about him wanting to kill a girl named \"Tomie\".\n\nLater, Yumi and Fumihito meet at a party and realize they are both looking for a girl named \"Tomie\". They join forces to find out what happened to Yumi's father, and to Fumihito's friend.\n\nThe next day, Yumi visits the family of the six-year-old girl who had had the operation. She learns that prior to that operation, the girl had received a kidney transplant from a girl named \"Tomie\". From this kidney, Tomie had begun to regenerate inside the girl's body. Meanwhile, Fumihito visits his friend Takeshi, who had gone mad after killing and decapitating Tomie in a fit of jealousy, then watching her come back to life, regenerating a new head. Takeshi soon after is committed to a mental hospital, and Fumihito becomes Tomie's new prey.\n\nThat night Yumi has a short and strange run-in with her missing father, during which he babbles about needing to kill Tomie. The following day his dead body is discovered in the hospital basement, bloated and deformed. At his funeral Yumi receives a note from Tomie, asking to meet her that night at the hospital, seemingly for a final showdown. \n\nYumi arrives at the hospital to find Tomie there to taunt her, and Fumihito, now under Tomie's spell, there apparently to kill her.  At the last minute Fumihito decides to kill Tomie instead, chopping off her head and burning the remains. Yumi and Fumihito leave the hospital in relief.\n\n===''Tomie: Re-birth'' (2001)===\n{{main|Tomie: Re-birth}}\nAn artist named Hideo is painting his girlfriend Tomie ([[Miki Sakai]]), but she dismisses it as a poor painting and he kills her in a jealous rage with an art knife and his two friends Shunsuke and Takumi help him bury her. When the three friends are at a party Tomie shows up and the artist kills himself in the bathroom. Tomie latches onto Shunsuke and his mother kills Tomie and they cut her up together in an unnatural ecstasy. They then burn her head, which has already started to regenerate and has some crude limbs for locomotion. The portrait of Tomie allows for her regeneration, as her supernatural blood mixed with the pigments. Takumi's girlfriend Hitomi gets possessed by Tomie, in a rather viral fashion. In a fit of jealousy, the two Tomies try to eliminate the other. \n\nHitomi doesn't want to become a monster, and so they decide to commit suicide. However, when at a waterfall, about to commit suicide, Tomie's head grows on the side of Hitomi's neck next to her head. They all die and then Takumi's sister comes and throws flowers into the water. A small facial mole can be seen directly beneath the sister's left eye, suggesting that, because Takumi gave her the portrait of Tomie, she was also possessed by her. Thus, the sister is the newest Tomie.\n\n===''Tomie: Forbidden Fruit'' (2002)===\n{{main|Tomie: Forbidden Fruit}}\nTomie Hashimoto ([[Aoi Miyazaki]]) is a dreamy teen who writes homo-erotic horror fiction in which she imagines herself as Ann Bathory, a vampire (borrowing from the murderous historical figure [[Elizabeth Bathory]]). Introspective and lonely, she is picked on and bullied by her classmates at school, and lives alone with her loving, but distant widower father, Kazuhiko Hashimoto. One day, while admiring an ornate, jewel encrusted [[cross necklace]] in an antiquities shop, Tomie meets a strange, beautiful girl (Nozomi Ando) with a mole under her left eye. The mysterious stranger says her name is Tomie Kawakami. The girls become fast friends (with heavy lesbian undertones), but it soon becomes clear that theirs was not a chance meeting. Tomie Kawakami has an agenda, and it involves Kazuhiko.\n\nIt is revealed Kazuhiko was involved in a relationship with Tomie many years ago which resulted in her being murdered. However, Kazuhiko was still obsessed with Tomie and even named his own daughter after her. Tomie is back to terrorize his family and tries to convince Kazuhiko to murder his daughter. Kazuhiko ends up murdering and decapitating the monster Tomie, and throws her head into a nearby river. His daughter, Tomie H. discovers the talking head and nurses Tomie K. back to health as she regenerates but ends up killing her. She and her father ultimately end up freezing Tomie into a block of ice to prevent her from regenerating and coming back to life, but after hearing the frozen Tomie's pleas and cries Kazuhiko ends up breaking the block of ice and setting her free. Tomie K. then attacks  Tomie H. but is defeated, which results in Kazuhiko locking his daughter into a freezer room. The morning after, Tomie H. is discovered by a worker from the ice sculpture company. Tomie Hashimoto is now shown living alone, with her father missing, albeit thankful because she believes he tried to save her from the other Tomie, which is the reason he teamed up with her and abandoned his daughter.\n\nTomie then goes to her room and continues to write her fanfiction. She writes: \"Ann and Mary are friends again, there'll be no issues this time. Ann will raise her to be a real friend, a friend whom she can depend on\". Tomie then opens her desk drawer and looks at a dismembered, regenerating ear. She mutters the words \"...a real friend\".\n\n===''Tomie: Beginning'' (2005)===\n{{main|Tomie: Beginning}}\nThis straight-to-video movie is a prequel to the rest of the series, shot on HD, and based on the first Tomie manga by Junji Ito. It deals with the chain of events that occurred right before the first film takes place. Tomie ([[Rio Matsumoto]]) shows up as a transfer student at a high school, quickly enchanting all the males, and raising the ire of the females.  As is often the case in the Tomie films, she fixates on one solitary girl whom she befriends, with overt lesbian overtones. She displays all of her typical powers, and it isn't long before the murders and madness begin.  In this movie we are introduced to the teacher who promises to kill her no matter how many times he has to do the \"favor\" as well as the eye-patch-wearing boy of the first movie in the series.\n\n===''Tomie: Revenge'' (2005)===\n{{main|Tomie: Revenge}}\nAnother home-video release shot on HD, this one partly based on the Tomie manga \"Revenge\" by Junji Ito. This time round, Tomie is played by Anri Ban. The story revolves around a young doctor (Hisako Shirata), and an unidentified naked woman she runs down on the road one night. In her search for the wounded girl (who has a mole under her left eye) the doctor ends up in an abandoned house filled with bodies, madmen and an unconscious girl. Surely Tomie is not too far away...\n\n===''Tomie vs Tomie ''(2007)===\n{{main|Tomie vs Tomie}}\nPartially based on the manga \"The Gathering.\"  A young man with a past begins work in a factory, where he attracts the amorous attention of a mysterious woman who lurks behind the scenes. He is a relatively unique young man, perhaps a genetic one-off, in that he feels no particular attraction to Tomie.  This of course intrigues Tomie, and ''she'' begins to become obsessed with ''him''.  Soon, he is caught in a vicious struggle between two rival Tomies. And neither Tomie will die.\n\n===''Tomie Unlimited'' (2011)===\n{{main|Tomie: Unlimited}}\n\nTsukiko Izumikawa (Moe Arai) is a member of the photography club in high school. On her way home with friend Yoshie (Aika Ota), Tsukiko runs into her older sister Tomie (Miu Nakamura) who goes to the same high school. Tomie is also with Toshio (Kensuke Owada) - a guy that Tsukiko has a secret crush on. Tsukiko is consumed with fierce jealousy over her sister, but at the same time is intoxicated with Tomie's beauty. Tsukiko keeps pressing the trigger on her camera. At that time Tomie tells her sister that she knows what she is feeling. When Tsukiko stops taking pictures, Tomie is crushed by a steel cross that falls from a building under construction, killing her in the process.\n\nOne year later, Tsukiko still suffers by recurring nightmares over her sister's death. Slowly, her daily life returns to some sense of normality. On Tomie's 18th birthday, her parents and Tsukiko stand around a birthday cake in her honor. At that time someone knocks on their door. Tomie stands in the doorway with her beauty shining even more brightly. Her parents are delighted to see Tomie and welcomes her back in joyful tears. Meanwhile, Tsukiko still jealous stands there unable to believe what is transpiring. Tomie manages to get her father Izumisawa (Kouichi Ohori) to whip Tsukiko across the back with a steam iron cable as punishment.\n\nTomie's behavior starts becoming increasingly bizarre and abnormal as she shows Tsukiko the scar on her neck that begins to evolve into a talking tumor. Tsukiko was fearful of Tomie's horrible appearance and she calls Tomie a \"monster\". Offended, Tomie decides to leave but is prevented from doing so when her father stabs and kills her into the pieces with a butcher knife.\n\nThe next morning, Tsukiko witnesses her mother Kimiko (Maiko Kawakami) and Izumisawa dismembering Tomie's body in the bathroom. Kimiko then disposes of Tomie's head by throwing it away in the trash bin and goes to prepare Tsukiko's school lunch, accidentally dropping several chunks of Tomie's flesh and hair in it. At school, Tsukiko notices a girl who looks exactly like her dead sister walk into class. Later on, during lunch break, Tsukiko opens her lunch pack and sees several miniature Tomie heads in it. She runs off and throws the lunch pack into the trash. When her friend Yoshie goes to look for Tsukiko, she hears noises in the trash and leans over to investigate. Suddenly, the miniature Tomie heads appear and strangle Yoshie with their abnormally long tongues, killing her.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, Tomie's head rises from the trash bin and convinces her father to kill his wife and feed her to her. Back at school, Tsukiko encounters Yoshie with a tumor on her neck and runs off in panic. When Yoshie enters the Judo club's room while looking for Tsukiko, she is decapitated by the members who mistook her head for the tumor's. Her headless body comes back to life and starts chasing the Judo club members. Tsukiko then walks into Toshio stabbing Tomie's body, and a new Tomie forms out of the blood and begins kissing Toshio. Tsukiko kills Toshio and runs off into a locker room and encounters several versions of Tomie.\n\nJust as she is about to be cornered by the Tomies, she wakes up in her bed. Her parents inform her that she is an only child and that she never had a sister. Tsukiko sighs in relief, believing she just had a bad nightmare which proves to be false when her father starts eating hair and her mother's head appears to be upside down. Her mother chases her with a knife but is attacked by a carnivorous centipede made out of Tomie's heads. Tsukiko runs upstairs and encounters Toshio and Yoshie who tell her that they never liked her and were pretending to be her friends all along. She pushes them down the stairs and they are both attacked by the centipedes. Tsukiko then encounters a grotesque, freakish, giant Tomie head in her living room, and after a brief conversation the Tomie centipedes begin crawling over her. \n\nFinally, Tsukiko is shown walking out of the house, resembling Tomie. As she walks through the streets of Japan, she observes other women she passes by, many of them also being Tomie. She walks up to a man, smiling, and is then shown being murdered by him in an apartment. Lying on the floor, she looks at a mirror and Tomie's reflection asks her \"Are you happy now, Tsukiko?\"\n\n===Future===\nIn July 2019, [[Alexandre Aja]] was announced to be developing a [[Web television|web television series]] adaptation of ''Tomie'' for [[Quibi]], in conjunction with [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[Universal Content Productions]], with [[David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick]] serving as writer and executive producer, with Hiroki Shirota onboard as co-producer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Squires|first1=John|title=Alexandre Aja Directing Adaptation of Junji Ito\u2019s \u2018Tomie\u2019 for Quibi!|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3574845/alexandre-aja-directing-adaptation-junji-itos-tomie-quibi/|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=July 24, 2019|date=July 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:99%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n'''{{center|List indicator(s)}}'''\n* This table shows the characters and the actors who have portrayed them throughout the franchise.\n* A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film, or that the character's presence in the film has not yet been announced.\n* A {{note label|young|Y|}} indicates an appearance as a younger version of a pre-existing character.\n* A {{note label|photo|P|}} indicates a photographic appearance only.\n* A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a vocal appearance only.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:14%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"11\" | Films\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9%;\" | [[Junji Ito Collection#Release|{{small|''Junji Ito Collection:''}}<br>OVA \u2013 ''Tomie'']]\n|-\n! style=\"width:8.5%;\" | [[Tomie (film)|''Tomie'']]\n! style=\"width:9.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Another Face|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Another Face'']]\n! style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Replay|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Replay'']]\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Re-birth|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Re-birth'']]\n! style=\"width:11%;\" | [[Tomie: Forbidden Fruit|''{{small|Tomie:<br>The Final Chapter \u2013}}<br>Forbidden Fruit'']]\n! style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Beginning|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Beginning'']]\n! style=\"width:7.5%;\" | [[Tomie: Revenge|''{{small|Tomie:}}<br>Revenge'']]\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1%;\" | [[Tomie vs Tomie|''Tomie vs. Tomie'']]\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | ''[[Tomie Unlimited]]''\n|-\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''1998'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''1999'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2000'''}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2001'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2002'''}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2005'''}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2007'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2011'''}}\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"| {{small|'''2018'''}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"13\" style=\"background:silver;\"| <span style=\"color: black;\">Main Characters</span>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Tomie Kawakami]]\n| [[Miho Kanno]]\n| Runa Nagai\n| Mai H\u014dsh\u014d\n| colspan=\"2\" | [[Miki Sakai]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Nozomi And\u00f4\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Rio Matsumoto]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Anri Ban\n| Y\u00fb Abiru\n| Emiko Matsuoka\n| Miu Nakamura{{efn|In ''[[Tomie Unlimited]]'', Tsukiko (as Tomie) is shown walking through the streets of Japan, with most of the women she passes by also being Tomie, with all previous Tomie actresses reprising their roles.<ref name=\"Tomie\" />}}\n| [[Rie Suegara]]{{ref|voice|V|}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Mami Nakamura]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | Miho Kanno{{ref|photo|P|}}\n| Kumiko End\u00f4\n| [[Mia Murano]]\n| Chika Arakawa{{ref|young|Y|}}\n| Natsuki Kasa{{ref|young|Y|}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Moe Arai\n| [[Monica Rial]]{{ref|voice|V|}}\n|-\n!

As such, this changing roster of faces has allowed for a range of interpretations and subtle shading to the part, the most popular being [[Miho Kanno]] and [[Miki Sakai]].  Miho Kanno was Junji Ito's own personal choice for the role; he apparently coached her in preparing for her audition, even suggesting she wear Tomie's trademark beauty mark under her left eye.\n\n== Comparison with the source material ==\nThe films manage to recreate the atmosphere of the manga.  Most of the stories occur during the dark of night for its sense of eeriness, and the films generally follow suit.\n\nTomie's sexuality in the films is more ambiguous.  In the manga, Tomie's attitude towards other women seems to range between thinly veiled hostility and outright murderous rage, while the film incarnation is known to seduce women as well as men.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.artport.co.jp/movie/tomie/ Tomie vs Tomie Official Site]\n*[http://www.sarudama.com/japanese_movies/tomie.shtml Review of the First Tomie Movie]\n\n{{Tomie}}\n\n[[Category:Japanese horror films]]\n[[Category:Horror film series]]\n[[Category:Japanese LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Japanese films]]\n[[Category:Tomie]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related horror films]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFuture:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: onboard \u2192 on board", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomie_(film_series)"}

The General's entourage itself was ambushed and he was forced to flee his vehicle. A second, this time successful, attempt to cross the Ichhogil Canal was made over the bridge in the village of Barki, just east of [[Lahore]].

India's [[1st Armoured Division (India)|1st Armoured Division]], labeled the \"pride of the Indian Army\", launched an offensive towards [[Sialkot]]. The Division divided itself into two prongs, was forced back by the Pakistani [[6th Armoured Division (Pakistan)|6th Armoured Division]] at Chawinda and was forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses of nearly 100 tanks.\n\nThe Pakistanis followed up their success by launching [[Operation Windup]], which forced the Indians back farther. Similarly, Pakistan's pride, the 1st Armoured Division, pushed an offensive towards [[Khem Karan]], with the intent to capture [[Amritsar]] (a major city in [[Punjab, India]]) and the bridge on [[River Beas]] to [[Jalandhar]].\n\nThe Pakistani 1st Armoured Division never made it past Khem Karan, however, and by the end of 10 September lay disintegrated by the defences of the Indian [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Mountain Division]] at what is now known as the [[Battle of Asal Uttar|Battle of ''Asal Uttar'']] (lit. meaning&nbsp;\u2013 \"Real Answer\", or more appropriate English equivalent&nbsp;\u2013 \"Fitting Response\"). The area became known as 'Patton Nagar' (Patton Town), because of the large number of US-made Pakistani [[M48 Patton|Patton tanks]]. Approximately 97 Pakistani tanks were destroyed or abandoned, with only 32 Indian tanks destroyed or damaged. The Pakistani 1st Armoured Division less 5th Armoured Brigade was next sent to Sialkot sector behind Pakistani 6th Armoured Division where it didn't see action as 6th Armoured Division was already in process of routing Indian 1st Armoured Division which was superior to it in strength.\n\nThe hostilities in the [[Rajasthan]] sector commenced on 8 September. Initially Pakistan Desert Force and the Hur militia (followers of Pir Pagaro) was placed in a defensive role, a role for which they were well suited as it turned out. The Hurs were familiar with the terrain and the local area and possessed many essential desert survival skills which their opponents and  their comrades in the Pakistan Army did not. Fighting as mainly light infantry, the Hur inflicted many casualties on the Indian forces as they entered Sindh. The Hurs were also employed as skirmishers, harassing the Indians LOC, a task they often undertook on camels. As the battle wore on the Hurs and the Desert Force were increasingly used to attack and capture Indian villages inside [[Rajasthan]].<ref>History of Indo-Pak War of 1965.

The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in [[Chumb]] and suffered significant losses as a result.\n\nThe \"[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/ARMY/history/1965war/275-war-history-1965.html Official War History \u2013 1965]\", drafted by the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence of India]] in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations. According to the document, on 22 September when the [[Security Council]] was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen. Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire. The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses. It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan. By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition.\n\nAir Chief Marshal (retd) P.C. Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] and the Indian army. Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other. The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle. This attitude of Gen. Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the \"Supremo Syndrome\", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military.<ref name=\"bharatrakshak\" />\n\n===Pakistani miscalculations===\nThe Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir. The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt. Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of [[Operation Gibraltar]] and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars.\n\n[[File:Mcconaughy20oct1965a.jpg|thumb|right|Telegram from the Embassy of the United States in [[Karachi]]: \"Continuing propaganda regarding achievements of Pak forces seems to have convinced most that only Pak forbearance saved the Indians from disaster.\"]]\n\nThe Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second [[Front (military)|front]]. Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir.\n\n\"[[Operation Grand Slam]]\", which was launched by Pakistan to capture [[Akhnoor]], a town north-east of [[Jammu]] and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure. Many Pakistani commentators criticised the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam. These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnoor to India (having called it India's \"[[jugular vein]]\") and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war. Despite progress being made in Akhnoor, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding [[Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik]] and replaced him with Gen. [[Yahya Khan]]. A 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnoor and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan. \"The enemy came to our rescue\", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command. Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticised Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war. Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_19-9-2004_pg7_30 Musharraf, the 'poor man's Ataturk' By Khalid Hasan] 19 September 2004 [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]</ref>\n\nSome authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a [[Military exercise|war game]]&nbsp;\u2013 conducted in March 1965, at the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] in the United States.

The General's entourage itself was ambushed and he was forced to flee his vehicle. A second, this time successful, attempt to cross the Ichhogil Canal was made over the bridge in the village of Barki, just east of [[Lahore]]. These developments brought the Indian Army within the range of [[Lahore International Airport]]. As a result, the United States requested a temporary ceasefire to allow it to evacuate its citizens in [[Lahore]].

India's [[1st Armoured Division (India)|1st Armoured Division]], labeled the \"pride of the Indian Army\", launched an offensive towards [[Sialkot]]. The Division divided itself into two prongs, was forced back by the Pakistani [[6th Armoured Division (Pakistan)|6th Armoured Division]] at Chawinda and was forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses of nearly 100 tanks.\n\nThe Pakistanis followed up their success by launching [[Operation Windup]], which forced the Indians back farther. Similarly, Pakistan's pride, the 1st Armoured Division, pushed an offensive towards [[Khem Karan]], with the intent to capture [[Amritsar]] (a major city in [[Punjab, India]]) and the bridge on [[River Beas]] to [[Jalandhar]].\n\nThe Pakistani 1st Armoured Division never made it past Khem Karan, however, and by the end of 10 September lay disintegrated by the defences of the Indian [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Mountain Division]] at what is now known as the [[Battle of Asal Uttar|Battle of ''Asal Uttar'']] (lit. meaning&nbsp;\u2013 \"Real Answer\", or more appropriate English equivalent&nbsp;\u2013 \"Fitting Response\"). The area became known as 'Patton Nagar' (Patton Town), because of the large number of US-made Pakistani [[M48 Patton|Patton tanks]]. Approximately 97 Pakistani tanks were destroyed or abandoned, with only 32 Indian tanks destroyed or damaged. The Pakistani 1st Armoured Division less 5th Armoured Brigade was next sent to Sialkot sector behind Pakistani 6th Armoured Division where it didn't see action as 6th Armoured Division was already in process of routing Indian 1st Armoured Division which was superior to it in strength.\n\nThe hostilities in the [[Rajasthan]] sector commenced on 8 September. Initially Pakistan Desert Force and the Hur militia (followers of Pir Pagaro) was placed in a defensive role, a role for which they were well suited as it turned out. The Hurs were familiar with the terrain and the local area and possessed many essential desert survival skills which their opponents and  their comrades in the Pakistan Army did not. Fighting as mainly light infantry, the Hur inflicted many casualties on the Indian forces as they entered Sindh. The Hurs were also employed as skirmishers, harassing the Indians LOC, a task they often undertook on camels. As the battle wore on the Hurs and the Desert Force were increasingly used to attack and capture Indian villages inside [[Rajasthan]].<ref>History of Indo-Pak War of 1965.

Most of these assessments agree that India had the upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared. Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below&nbsp;\u2014\n* According to the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] conducted by the [[Federal Research Division]] of the [[United States]]<ref name=\"USLib\"/> \u2013\n\n<blockquote>\nThe war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other. Losses were relatively heavy\u2014on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops. Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan. Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by \"Hindu India\" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government.\n</blockquote>\n* Former ''New York Times'' reporter Arif Jamal wrote in his book ''Shadow War''{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=86}}&nbsp;\u2014\n<blockquote>\nThis time, India's victory was nearly total: India accepted cease-fire only after it had occupied 740 square miles, though Pakistan had made marginal gains of 210 square miles of territory.

The Soviet Union, led by Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]], hosted ceasefire negotiations in [[Tashkent]] (now in [[Uzbekistan]]), where Indian Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the [[Tashkent Agreement]], agreeing to withdraw to pre-August lines no later than 25 February 1966.\n\nWith declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor.

The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in [[Chumb]] and suffered significant losses as a result.\n\nThe \"[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/ARMY/history/1965war/275-war-history-1965.html Official War History \u2013 1965]\", drafted by the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence of India]] in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations. According to the document, on 22 September when the [[Security Council]] was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen. Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire. The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses. It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan. By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition.\n\nAir Chief Marshal (retd) P.C. Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] and the Indian army. Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other. The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle. This attitude of Gen. Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the \"Supremo Syndrome\", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military.<ref name=\"bharatrakshak\" />\n\n===Pakistani miscalculations===\nThe Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir. The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt. Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of [[Operation Gibraltar]] and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars.\n\n[[File:Mcconaughy20oct1965a.jpg|thumb|right|Telegram from the Embassy of the United States in [[Karachi]]: \"Continuing propaganda regarding achievements of Pak forces seems to have convinced most that only Pak forbearance saved the Indians from disaster.\"]]\n\nThe Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second [[Front (military)|front]]. Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir.\n\n\"[[Operation Grand Slam]]\", which was launched by Pakistan to capture [[Akhnoor]], a town north-east of [[Jammu]] and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure. Many Pakistani commentators criticised the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam. These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnoor to India (having called it India's \"[[jugular vein]]\") and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war. Despite progress being made in Akhnoor, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding [[Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik]] and replaced him with Gen. [[Yahya Khan]]. A 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnoor and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan. \"The enemy came to our rescue\", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command. Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticised Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war. Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_19-9-2004_pg7_30 Musharraf, the 'poor man's Ataturk' By Khalid Hasan] 19 September 2004 [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]</ref>\n\nSome authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a [[Military exercise|war game]]&nbsp;\u2013 conducted in March 1965, at the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] in the United States.
