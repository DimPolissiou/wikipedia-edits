After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert,which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market.

Dargis noted that Tintin's appearance in the film \"resembled Herg\u00e9's creation, yet was eerily different as if, like [[Pinocchio]], his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted\". Another major fault in the film, Dargis points out, is how it is so wildly overworked; she writes that there is \"hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes\". Nevertheless, she singles out some of the \"interludes of cinematic delight\", approving of the visual imagination employed within the movie's numerous exciting scenes.<ref name=\"Dargis\">Dargis, Manohla.

After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert,which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

Dargis noted that Tintin's appearance in the film \"resembled Herg\u00e9's creation, yet was eerily different as if, like [[Pinocchio]], his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted\". Another major fault in the film, Dargis points out, is how it is so wildly overworked; she writes that there is \"hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes\".

Montefiore]]. He was born at the family home of number 12, [[Portman Square]] on 2 June 1889. His mother, Therese Alice, died on the following day, and so he was brought up by his grandmother, Emma Montefiore, who was from the wealthy [[Goldsmid family]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHe was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he read history. While a student, he spent time in Berlin and Hanover, where he became fluent in German. After graduation, he worked and lived at [[Toynbee Hall]]\u2014a [[settlement movement|settlement]] house in which rich people lived alongside the poor to do social work and alleviate poverty.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1914, at the start of the [[First World War]], he joined a cycling battalion of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]. He served in India and [[Siberian intervention|Siberia]], rising to the rank of captain. In 1918, he was admitted to the [[Order of the British Empire]], and in 1921 he joined the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]], being introduced by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Viscount Milner]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1924, he married the sister of a close friend from college, Muriel Jeanetta Tuck (1892\u20131988), who was from the wealthy family that ran [[Raphael Tuck & Sons]].

Montefiore was at that time co-chairman of the Joint Foreign Committee of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] and the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]; the other co-chairman was [[Neville Laski]]. This committee had a tradition of protecting and supporting overseas Jews and it then established the [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]. Another founder member was Otto Schiff, who organised the Jewish Refugees Committee, which Montefiore chaired. The wealth supporting this fund enabled a promise to be made to the British government that Jewish refugees from Germany would not be a burden on public finances.<ref name=KC/> They also lobbied British society to protest against German discrimination against Jews but were not successful initially. Others wanted to organise a boycott of German goods but the Board of Deputies saw this as too extreme. There was also concern about [[Zionism|Zionist]] influence, which the Board opposed as subverting their status as British.<ref name=Gewirtz/> Montefiore was himself opposed to Zionism until he visited Israel in 1955.<ref name=DNB/>     \n\nMontefiore's fluency in the German language enabled him to study the details of the oppression of the Jews in Germany.<ref name=DNB/> He publicised these, writing articles, letters and [[pamphlet]]s including ''The Jews in Germany: Facts and Figures'' (1934) and ''Exiles from Germany'' (1937).<ref name=Palgrave/>\n\nIn 1944, he toured the Mediterranean theatre to meet [[Jewish Brigade|Jewish servicemen]] for the Welfare Branch of the [[War Office]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\n==The Windermere children==\nMontefiore organised aid for hundreds of Jewish orphans after the Second World War, acting as their [[legal guardian|guardian]] and arranging for them to be flown to England in heavy bombers by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].<ref name=ToI/> They had been liberated from Nazi concentration camps and so required care and rehabilitation for which he arranged a special camp at [[Windermere]].

Montefiore]]. He was born at the family home of number 12, [[Portman Square]] on 2 June 1889. His mother, Therese Alice, died on the following day, and so he was brought up by his grandmother, Emma Montefiore, who was from the wealthy [[Goldsmid family]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHe was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he read history. While a student, he spent time in Berlin and Hanover, where he became fluent in German. After graduation, he worked and lived at [[Toynbee Hall]]\u2014a [[settlement movement|settlement]] house in which rich people lived alongside the poor to do social work and alleviate poverty.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1914, at the start of the [[First World War]], he joined a cycling battalion of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]. He served in India and [[Siberian intervention|Siberia]], rising to the rank of captain. In 1918, he was admitted to the [[Order of the British Empire]], and in 1921 he joined the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]], being introduced by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Viscount Milner]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1924, he married the sister of a close friend from college, Muriel Jeanetta Tuck (1892\u20131988), who was from the wealthy family that ran [[Raphael Tuck & Sons]]. They had two sons, David and Alan, who became a physician and Oxford don.<ref name=DNB/>{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<!-- who became a physician? -->\n\n==Charitable service==\nLeonard Montefiore was active in numerous charitable, cultural, and philanthropic organisations. [[Chaim Bermant]] wrote, \"He attended them all, gave money to them all, offered guidance to them all\".<ref name=DNB/>\n\nThese organisation included:<ref name=DNB/>\n* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] \u2013 president, vice-president, chairman of the industrial committee\n* [[Bernhard Baron Settlement]]\n* [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]\n* [[Clifton College]] \u2013 governor\n* [[Froebel Educational Institute]] \u2013 chairman 1939\u20131961\n* [[Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women]]\n* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]] \u2013 chairman of the industrial committee\n* [[Jewish Colonization Association]]\n* [[Jewish Refugees Committee]] \u2013 chairman\n* [[Jews\u2019 Free School]]\n* [[Jews\u2019 Temporary Shelter]]\n* [[League of British Jews]]\n* [[Leo Baeck College]] \u2013 chairman\n* [[Reform Synagogues Association]] \u2013 president\n* [[West London Synagogue]] \u2013 reader, senior treasurer, vice-president and warden\n* [[Wiener Library]] \u2013 founder and president\n\n==Germany and the Second World War==\nWhen Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and his National Socialist party seized power, they threatened the Jewish community in Germany. Montefiore was at that time co-chairman of the Joint Foreign Committee of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] and the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]; the other co-chairman was [[Neville Laski]]. This committee had a tradition of protecting and supporting overseas Jews and it then established the [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]. Another founder member was Otto Schiff, who organised the Jewish Refugees Committee, which Montefiore chaired. The wealth supporting this fund enabled a promise to be made to the British government that Jewish refugees from Germany would not be a burden on public finances.<ref name=KC/> They also lobbied British society to protest against German discrimination against Jews but were not successful initially. Others wanted to organise a boycott of German goods but the Board of Deputies saw this as too extreme. There was also concern about [[Zionism|Zionist]] influence, which the Board opposed as subverting their status as British.<ref name=Gewirtz/> Montefiore was himself opposed to Zionism until he visited Israel in 1955.<ref name=DNB/>     \n\nMontefiore's fluency in the German language enabled him to study the details of the oppression of the Jews in Germany.<ref name=DNB/> He publicised these, writing articles, letters and [[pamphlet]]s including ''The Jews in Germany: Facts and Figures'' (1934) and ''Exiles from Germany'' (1937).<ref name=Palgrave/>\n\nIn 1944, he toured the Mediterranean theatre to meet [[Jewish Brigade|Jewish servicemen]] for the Welfare Branch of the [[War Office]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\n==The Windermere children==\nMontefiore organised aid for hundreds of Jewish orphans after the Second World War, acting as their [[legal guardian|guardian]] and arranging for them to be flown to England in heavy bombers by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].<ref name=ToI/> They had been liberated from Nazi concentration camps and so required care and rehabilitation for which he arranged a special camp at [[Windermere]]. Montefiore made regular visits and took a personal interest in their development. Nurse Eva Kahn-Minden recalled his manner,\n\n{{quote|text=Monty has been to pay one of his flying visits.
