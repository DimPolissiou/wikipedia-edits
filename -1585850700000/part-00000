This could have in part caused the widespread extinctions of marine species at the end of the period by severely reducing shallow coastal areas preferred by many marine organisms.\n\n==Paleogeography==\n[[File:280 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|230px|left|Geography of the Permian world]]\nDuring the Permian, all the [[Earth]]'s major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the [[equator]] and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (\"[[Panthalassa]]\", the \"universal sea\"), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that existed between Asia and Gondwana. The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmeria]] continent [[rift]]ed away from [[Gondwana]] and drifted north to [[Laurasia]], causing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the [[Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that would dominate much of the [[Mesozoic]] era. Large continental landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (\"[[continental climate]]\") and [[monsoon]] conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Such dry conditions favored [[gymnosperm]]s, plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as [[fern]]s that disperse [[spore]]s in a wetter environment. The first modern trees ([[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s) appeared in the Permian.\n\nThree general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits\u2014the [[Ural Mountains]] (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, including the [[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|Texas red beds.]] The [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]] is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Selwyn Rock 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Inman Valley, South Australia|Selwyn Rock, South Australia]], an exhumed [[Glacial striation|glacial pavement]] of Permian age]]\nThe [[climate]] in the Permian was quite varied.

By the close of the Permian, [[trilobite]]s and a host of other marine groups became extinct.\n\n===Terrestrial biota===\nTerrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[arthropod]]s, and various types of [[List of Permian tetrapods|tetrapods]]. The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of [[Pangaea]]. The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared.<ref name=\"ucmp.berkeley.edu\"/> The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides, the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover. A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements.\n\nThe Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The [[swamp]]-loving [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopod]] trees of the Carboniferous, such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]'', were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced [[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]] and early [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. At the close of the Permian, lycopod and [[Equisetopsida|equisete]] swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only on a series of equatorial islands in the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] that later would become [[South China (continent)|South China]].<ref>Xu, R. & Wang, X.-Q.

Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the ''[[Glossopteris]]'' flora. Oxygen levels were probably high there. The [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s also appeared during this period.\n\n====Insects====\nFrom the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] period until well into the Permian, the most successful insects were primitive [[Blattoptera|relatives of cockroaches]]. Six fast legs, four well-developed folding wings, fairly good eyes, long, well-developed antennae (olfactory), an omnivorous digestive system, a receptacle for storing sperm, a [[chitin]]-based [[exoskeleton]] that could support and protect, as well as a form of gizzard and efficient mouth parts, gave it formidable advantages over other herbivorous animals.

[[Nautiloids]], a subclass of cephalopods, surprisingly survived this occurrence.\n\nThere is evidence that magma, in the form of [[flood basalt]], poured onto the Earth's surface in what is now called the [[Siberian Traps]], for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.<ref name=\"palaeos.com\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis involves ocean venting of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Portions of the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an [[Anoxic event|anoxic zone]], the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy [[ozone]] in the upper atmosphere allowing [[ultraviolet]] radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas.<ref name=Kump>{{cite journal\n | author=Kump, L.R., A.

An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until [[Methane clathrate|frozen methane reservoirs]] below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent [[greenhouse gas]]es) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian\u2013Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|last2=Twitchett|first2=Richard J.|title=How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=7 July 2003|volume=18|issue=7|pages=358\u2013365|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00093-4}}</ref>\n\nAn even more speculative hypothesis is that intense radiation from a nearby [[supernova]] was responsible for the extinctions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|title=Could a nearby supernova explosion have caused a mass extinction?|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=42852|pmid=11607506|volume=92|issue=1|date=January 1995|pages=235\u20138|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.1.235|arxiv=hep-ph/9303206|bibcode=1995PNAS...92..235E}}</ref>\n\nIt has been hypothesised that huge [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]] ([[Wilkes Land crater]]) with a diameter of around 500 kilometers in Antarctica represents an impact event that may be related to the extinction.<ref name=\"big bang\">{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica \u2013 Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Ohio State University Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| date=June 1, 2006| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> The crater is located at a depth of 1.6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica.

Levels of iridium and quartz fracturing in the Permian\u2013Triassic layer do not approach those of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] layer. Given that a far greater proportion of species and individual organisms became extinct during the former, doubt is cast on the significance of a meteorite impact in creating the latter.

This could have in part caused the widespread extinctions of marine species at the end of the period by severely reducing shallow coastal areas preferred by many marine organisms.\n\n==Paleogeography==\n[[File:280 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|230px|left|Geography of the Permian world]]\nDuring the Permian, all the [[Earth]]'s major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the [[equator]] and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (\"[[Panthalassa]]\", the \"universal sea\"), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that existed between Asia and Gondwana. The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmeria]] continent [[rift]]ed away from [[Gondwana]] and drifted north to [[Laurasia]], causing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the [[Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that would dominate much of the [[Mesozoic]] era. Large continental landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (\"[[continental climate]]\") and [[monsoon]] conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Such dry conditions favored [[gymnosperm]]s, plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as [[fern]]s that disperse [[spore]]s in a wetter environment. The first modern trees ([[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s) appeared in the Permian.\n\nThree general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits\u2014the [[Ural Mountains]] (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, including the [[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|Texas red beds.]] The [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]] is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Selwyn Rock 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Inman Valley, South Australia|Selwyn Rock, South Australia]], an exhumed [[Glacial striation|glacial pavement]] of Permian age]]\nThe [[climate]] in the Permian was quite varied.

By the close of the Permian, [[trilobite]]s and a host of other marine groups became extinct.\n\n===Terrestrial biota===\nTerrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[arthropod]]s, and various types of [[List of Permian tetrapods|tetrapods]]. The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of [[Pangaea]]. The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared.<ref name=\"ucmp.berkeley.edu\"/> The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides, the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover. A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements.\n\nThe Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The [[swamp]]-loving [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopod]] trees of the Carboniferous, such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]'', were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced [[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]] and early [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. At the close of the Permian, lycopod and [[Equisetopsida|equisete]] swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only on a series of equatorial islands in the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] that later would become [[South China (continent)|South China]].<ref>Xu, R. & Wang, X.-Q.

Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the ''[[Glossopteris]]'' flora.

It was the high tide of the [[anapsid]]s in the form of the massive [[pareiasaur]]s and host of smaller, generally lizard-like groups. A group of small reptiles, the [[diapsid]]s, started to abound. These were the ancestors to most modern reptiles and the ruling dinosaurs as well as pterosaurs and crocodiles.\n\n[[Synapsid]]s (the group that would later include mammals) thrived and diversified greatly at this time. Permian synapsids included some large members such as ''[[Dimetrodon]]''. The special adaptations of synapsids enabled them to flourish in the drier climate of the Permian and they grew to dominate the vertebrates.<ref name=\"Huttenlocker, A. K. 2012.

[[Nautiloids]], a subclass of cephalopods, surprisingly survived this occurrence.\n\nThere is evidence that magma, in the form of [[flood basalt]], poured onto the Earth's surface in what is now called the [[Siberian Traps]], for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.<ref name=\"palaeos.com\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis involves ocean venting of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Portions of the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an [[Anoxic event|anoxic zone]], the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy [[ozone]] in the upper atmosphere allowing [[ultraviolet]] radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas.<ref name=Kump>{{cite journal\n | author=Kump, L.R., A.

An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until [[Methane clathrate|frozen methane reservoirs]] below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent [[greenhouse gas]]es) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian\u2013Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|last2=Twitchett|first2=Richard J.|title=How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=7 July 2003|volume=18|issue=7|pages=358\u2013365|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00093-4}}</ref>\n\nAn even more speculative hypothesis is that intense radiation from a nearby [[supernova]] was responsible for the extinctions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|title=Could a nearby supernova explosion have caused a mass extinction?|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pmc=42852|pmid=11607506|volume=92|issue=1|date=January 1995|pages=235\u20138|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.1.235|arxiv=hep-ph/9303206|bibcode=1995PNAS...92..235E}}</ref>\n\nIt has been hypothesised that huge [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]] ([[Wilkes Land crater]]) with a diameter of around 500 kilometers in Antarctica represents an impact event that may be related to the extinction.<ref name=\"big bang\">{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica \u2013 Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Ohio State University Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| date=June 1, 2006| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> The crater is located at a depth of 1.6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica.

They also speculate that it may have contributed in some way to the separation of Australia from the Antarctic landmass, which were both part of a supercontinent called [[Gondwana]]. Levels of iridium and quartz fracturing in the Permian\u2013Triassic layer do not approach those of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] layer. Given that a far greater proportion of species and individual organisms became extinct during the former, doubt is cast on the significance of a meteorite impact in creating the latter.

CH attacks often awaken individuals from sleep.  Both individual attacks and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks typically striking at a precise time of day each morning or night. The recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around solstices, or seasonal changes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have prompted researchers to speculate an involvement, or dysfunction of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the body's \"biological clock\" and [[circadian rhythm]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0317167100001694 |pmid=11858532 |title=Cluster Headache: Evidence for a Disorder of Circadian Rhythm and Hypothalamic Function |journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201340 |year=2014 |last1=Pringsheim |first1=Tamara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1526-4610.2003.03055.x |pmid=12603650 |title=Clinical, Anatomical, and Physiologic Relationship Between Sleep and Headache |journal=Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=282\u201392 |year=2003 |last1=Dodick |first1=David W. |last2=Eross |first2=Eric J. |last3=Parish |first3=James M. }}</ref> In episodic cluster headache, attacks occur once or more daily, often at the same time each day for a period of several weeks, followed by a headache-free period lasting weeks, months, or years.

(However, in the ''Theaetetus'' and in the ''Meno'', Plato has [[Socrates]] suggest that knowledge is ''orthos doxa'' for which one can provide a ''logos'', thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as \"[[justified true belief]]\".) Thus, error is considered in as pure negative, which can take various forms, among them the form of [[illusion]]. \n\nPlato's student [[Aristotle]] objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge ([[episteme]]), as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it.<ref> {{cite web |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageukcst/doxa/0 |title= Doxa |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2005  |website= Credo Reference |publisher= Sage UK |accessdate=March 2, 2014}} </ref> Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as ''endoxa''.<ref> {{cite journal |last=Eggs |first= Ekkehard |last2= McElholm |first2= Dermot |date= 2002 |title= Doxa in Poetry: A Study of Aristotle's Poetics |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v023/23.3eggs.pdf |journal= Poetics Today  |publisher= Duke University Press |volume= 23 |pages= 395-426 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |doi=10.1215/03335372-23-3-395}} </ref> ''Endoxa'' is a more stable belief than ''doxa'', because it has been \"tested\" in argumentative struggles in the ''[[Polis]]'' by prior interlocutors. The term ''endoxa'' is used in Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'', ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and ''[[Rhetoric]]''.\n\nIn [[Pyrrhonism]] ''doxa'' and ''[[dogma]]'' regarding non-evident matters form the target of Pyrrhonist practice. About such matters practitioners suspend judgment ([[epoche]]) to induce [[ataraxia]] (unperturbedness).\n\n==Use in sociology and anthropology<!--linked from 'Pierre Bourdieu'-->==\n\n[[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. 1977 [1972]. Outline of a Theory of Practice. R. Nice, transl. Volume 16. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> used the term ''doxa'' to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The ''doxa'', in his view, is the experience by which \"the natural and social world appears as self-evident\".<ref>Bourdieu (1972); p.164</ref> It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable (\"the universe of possible discourse\"), that which \"goes without saying because it comes without saying\".<ref>Bourdieu (1972); pp. 167, 169</ref> The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of ''doxa'' are to be traced in ''Distinction'' where ''doxa'' sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by ''doxa'' as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence ''doxa'' helps to petrify social limits, the \"sense of one's place\", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that \"this is not for us\" (''ce n'est pas pour nous''). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. 1979. La Distinction. Critique Sociale du Jugement. Paris: Les \u00e9ditions de minuit. Page 549</ref>\n\nDoxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.<ref>[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/bourdieu_pierre.htm Pierre Bourdieu - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBourdieu explains the term \"doxa\" in his interview with theorist [[Terry Eagleton]]<ref>Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. \"Doxa and common life\". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.</ref>. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.\n\nFor example, Bourdieu contends that it is a socially accepted misconception that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than they, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.<ref>Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. \"Doxa and common life\". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.</ref><ref>Vernon, Phillip E. \"Intelligence and Cultural Environment\". London: Methuen, 1969, p 215. Print.</ref>\n\n==Role in democracy==\n\nWhile doxa is used as a tool for the formation of [[argument]], it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by [[James A. Herrick]] in ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction'': \"The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James, A.|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd ed.|year=2005|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}</ref> Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not [[homogeneous]], nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect\u2014the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing \"truths\".\n \nTo expand upon the quote from his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' in the above section, \"Use in sociology and anthropology\", Bourdieu writes, \"When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164}}</ref> Adam Smith of the [[University of Chicago]] observes in his article \"The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view\": \"Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adam T.|title=The Limitations of Doxa: Agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1177/146960530100100201}}</ref> This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.\n \nDoxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Common sense]]\n* [[Dogma]]\n* ''[[Idola tribus]]''\n* [[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|Doxa of Parmenides]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Philosophy topics}}\n{{ Ancient Greek philosophical concepts}}\n\n[[Category:Anthropology]]\n[[Category:Belief]]\n[[Category:Political concepts]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of science]]\n[[Category:Roman-era philosophy]]\n[[Category:Enlightenment philosophy]]\n[[Category:Medieval philosophy]]\n[[Category:Skepticism]]\n[[Category:Pyrrhonism]]\n[[Category:Scholasticism]]\n[[Category:19th-century philosophy]]\n[[Category:20th-century philosophy]]\n[[Category:Concepts in ancient Greek epistemology]]\n\n[[it:Doxa (filosofia)]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n\n'''Doxa''' ([[ancient Greek]] \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1; from verb \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd ''dokein'', \"to appear\", \"to seem\", \"to think\" and \"to accept\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9] in Liddell and Scott</ref>) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning common [[belief]] or popular [[opinion]].

It is the unification of these multiple meanings of doxa that is reflected in the modern terms of [[orthodoxy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=orthodox |title=\"Orthodox\" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}</ref> and [[heterodoxy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heterodox |title=\"Heterodox\" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ware |first1=Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) |authorlink1=Kallistos Ware |title=The Orthodox Church |edition=new |pages=8,266 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Penguin Books |date=29 Apr 1993 |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1 |ref=none }}</ref> This semantic merging in the word ''doxa'' is also seen in Russian word \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 (''slava''), which means ''glory'', but is used with the meaning of ''belief'', ''opinion'' in words like \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435 (''pravoslavie'', meaning ''orthodoxy'', or, literally, ''true belief'').\n\n==In Philosophy==\nIn Plato's [[Gorgias (dialogue)]], Plato presents the [[sophists]] as wordsmiths who ensnared and used the malleable doxa of the multitude to their advantage without shame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html |title='Gorgias |last=Plato |date= 380 B.C.E.  |trans-title=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=[[Internet Classics Archive]] |accessdate=2013-02-11}}</ref> In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sorabji |first1=Richard|editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha C.|date= March 26, 1992 |title= Essays on Aristotle's De Anima |publisher= Oxford University Press }}</ref> This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form.<ref> {{cite journal |last= Szaif |first= Jan |date= 2007 |title= Doxa and Episteme as Modes of Acquaintance in Republic V |url= http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |journal= Les Etudes Platoniciennes |publisher= Les Belles Lettres |volume= IV |pages= 253\u2013272 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140306030717/http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |archivedate= 6 March 2014 }} </ref> Plato's framing of ''doxa'' as the opponent of [[knowledge]] led to the classical opposition of [[error]] to [[truth]], which has since become a major concern in [[Western philosophy]]. (However, in the ''Theaetetus'' and in the ''Meno'', Plato has [[Socrates]] suggest that knowledge is ''orthos doxa'' for which one can provide a ''logos'', thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as \"[[justified true belief]]\".) Thus, error is considered in as pure negative, which can take various forms, among them the form of [[illusion]]. \n\nPlato's student [[Aristotle]] objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge ([[episteme]]), as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it.<ref> {{cite web |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageukcst/doxa/0 |title= Doxa |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2005  |website= Credo Reference |publisher= Sage UK |accessdate=March 2, 2014}} </ref> Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as ''endoxa''.<ref> {{cite journal |last=Eggs |first= Ekkehard |last2= McElholm |first2= Dermot |date= 2002 |title= Doxa in Poetry: A Study of Aristotle's Poetics |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v023/23.3eggs.pdf |journal= Poetics Today  |publisher= Duke University Press |volume= 23 |pages= 395-426 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |doi=10.1215/03335372-23-3-395}} </ref> ''Endoxa'' is a more stable belief than ''doxa'', because it has been \"tested\" in argumentative struggles in the ''[[Polis]]'' by prior interlocutors. The term ''endoxa'' is used in Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'', ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and ''[[Rhetoric]]''.\n\nIn [[Pyrrhonism]] ''doxa'' and ''[[dogma]]'' regarding non-evident matters form the target of Pyrrhonist practice. About such matters practitioners suspend judgment ([[epoche]]) to induce [[ataraxia]] (unperturbedness).\n\n==Use in sociology and anthropology<!--linked from 'Pierre Bourdieu'-->==\n\n[[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. 1977 [1972]. Outline of a Theory of Practice. R. Nice, transl. Volume 16. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> used the term ''doxa'' to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The ''doxa'', in his view, is the experience by which \"the natural and social world appears as self-evident\".<ref>Bourdieu (1972); p.164</ref> It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable (\"the universe of possible discourse\"), that which \"goes without saying because it comes without saying\".<ref>Bourdieu (1972); pp. 167, 169</ref> The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of ''doxa'' are to be traced in ''Distinction'' where ''doxa'' sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by ''doxa'' as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence ''doxa'' helps to petrify social limits, the \"sense of one's place\", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that \"this is not for us\" (''ce n'est pas pour nous''). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. 1979. La Distinction. Critique Sociale du Jugement. Paris: Les \u00e9ditions de minuit. Page 549</ref>\n\nDoxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.<ref>[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/bourdieu_pierre.htm Pierre Bourdieu - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nBourdieu explains the term \"doxa\" in his interview with theorist [[Terry Eagleton]]<ref>Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. \"Doxa and common life\". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.</ref>. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.\n\nFor example, Bourdieu contends that it is a socially accepted misconception that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than they, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.<ref>Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. \"Doxa and common life\".

Print.</ref>\n\n==Role in democracy==\n\nWhile doxa is used as a tool for the formation of [[argument]], it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by [[James A. Herrick]] in ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction'': \"The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James, A.|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd ed.|year=2005|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}</ref> Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not [[homogeneous]], nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect\u2014the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing \"truths\".\n \nTo expand upon the quote from his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' in the above section, \"Use in sociology and anthropology\", Bourdieu writes, \"When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164}}</ref> Adam Smith of the [[University of Chicago]] observes in his article \"The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view\": \"Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adam T.|title=The Limitations of Doxa: Agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1177/146960530100100201}}</ref> This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.\n \nDoxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Common sense]]\n* [[Dogma]]\n* ''[[Idola tribus]]''\n* [[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|Doxa of Parmenides]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Philosophy topics}}\n{{ Ancient Greek philosophical concepts}}\n\n[[Category:Anthropology]]\n[[Category:Belief]]\n[[Category:Political concepts]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of science]]\n[[Category:Roman-era philosophy]]\n[[Category:Enlightenment philosophy]]\n[[Category:Medieval philosophy]]\n[[Category:Skepticism]]\n[[Category:Pyrrhonism]]\n[[Category:Scholasticism]]\n[[Category:19th-century philosophy]]\n[[Category:20th-century philosophy]]\n[[Category:Concepts in ancient Greek epistemology]]\n\n[[it:Doxa (filosofia)]]\n", "name_user": "Teishin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn Philosophy:copyedit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxa"}

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name=\"iaarch\">Alex, Lynn M.

Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] that surrendered much of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832, out of the [[Iowa River]] valley in 1843, and out of Iowa altogether in 1846. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the [[Meskwaki Settlement]] remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land; Indians were not usually permitted to do so. The [[Ho-Chunk]] were removed from Iowa in 1850, and the [[Sioux|Dakota]] were removed by the late 1850s. Western Iowa around modern [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west, including the [[Potawatomi]].\n\n===U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860===\n\n{{Main|Michigan Territory|Wisconsin Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Iowa Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Iowa territorial seal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Iowa [[Seal of Iowa#Iowa territorial seal|Territorial Seal]]]]\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.<ref name=Settlers>{{cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Schwieder, Dorothy|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Primarily, they were families from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]] who settled along the western banks of the [[Mississippi River]], founding the modern day cities of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] and [[Bellevue, Iowa|Bellevue]].<ref name=Settlers/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://co.jackson.ia.us/history.htm|title=Jackson County, Iowa History Information|publisher=Jackson County, Iowa|accessdate=November 3, 2019}}</ref> On July 4, 1838, the [[U.S. Congress]] established the [[Territory of Iowa]].

On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>\"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa\", Marcus L.

The first fair was held October 25\u201327, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]].

The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer.\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first farm-related industries developed in the 1870s, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985===\n\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The [[Great Depression]] and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization.

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]].

Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] that surrendered much of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832, out of the [[Iowa River]] valley in 1843, and out of Iowa altogether in 1846. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the [[Meskwaki Settlement]] remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land; Indians were not usually permitted to do so. The [[Ho-Chunk]] were removed from Iowa in 1850, and the [[Sioux|Dakota]] were removed by the late 1850s. Western Iowa around modern [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west, including the [[Potawatomi]].\n\n===U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860===\n\n{{Main|Michigan Territory|Wisconsin Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Iowa Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Iowa territorial seal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Iowa [[Seal of Iowa#Iowa territorial seal|Territorial Seal]]]]\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.<ref name=Settlers>{{cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Schwieder, Dorothy|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Primarily, they were families from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]] who settled along the western banks of the [[Mississippi River]], founding the modern day cities of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] and [[Bellevue, Iowa|Bellevue]].<ref name=Settlers/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://co.jackson.ia.us/history.htm|title=Jackson County, Iowa History Information|publisher=Jackson County, Iowa|accessdate=November 3, 2019}}</ref> On July 4, 1838, the [[U.S. Congress]] established the [[Territory of Iowa]].

On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>\"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa\", Marcus L.

The first fair was held October 25\u201327, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The fair was also a [[World War II]] wartime casualty from 1942 to 1945, as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |title=Iowa State Fair |publisher=Trivia |accessdate=December 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130160719/http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |archivedate=November 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Civil War, 1861\u20131865===\n\n[[File:Kirkwoods 1852.jpg|thumb|Jane and [[Samuel J.

The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer.\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first farm-related industries developed in the 1870s, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985===\n\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The [[Great Depression]] and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization.

While agriculture continued to be the state's dominant industry, Iowans also produce a wide variety of products including refrigerators, washing machines, fountain pens, farm implements, and food products.\n\nThe [[farm crisis]] of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression.<ref>The Midwest Farm Crisis of the 1980s, [http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id395.htm Tripod.com]</ref> The crisis spurred a major, decade-long population decline.<ref name=\"iwin.iwd.state.ia.us\">Population Trends: The Changing Face of Iowa, [http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003011 State.ia.us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006013221/http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003011 |date=October 6, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985\u2013present===\n\nAfter bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture, and by the early 21st century was characterized by a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services.<ref name=\"iowalifechanging.com\">''Iowa Industries'', Iowa Workforce Development.
