They established [[Tynwald]] and introduced many land divisions that still exist. In 1266 [[Magnus VI of Norway|King Magnus VI of Norway]] ceded the islands to Scotland in the Treaty of Perth. But Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established until 1275, when the Manx were defeated in the [[Battle of Ronaldsway]], near [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]].\n\nIn 1290 King [[Edward I of England]] sent [[Walter de Huntercombe, 1st Baron Huntercombe|Walter de Huntercombe]] to take possession of Mann. It remained in English hands until 1313, when [[Robert the Bruce|Robert Bruce]] took it after besieging [[Castle Rushen]] for five weeks. A confused period followed when Mann was sometimes under English rule and sometimes Scottish, until 1346, when the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] decided the long struggle between England and Scotland in England's favour.\n\nThe Crown delegated its rule of the island to a series of lords and magnates. [[Tynwald]] passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the [[Lord of Mann]].\n\nIn 1866, the Isle of Man obtained limited home rule, with partly democratic elections to the [[House of Keys]], but the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] was appointed by the Crown.

It is expected that dark skies will generally be nominated by the public across the UK. However, the Isle of Man tourism board tasked someone from their team to nominate 27 places on the island as a civil task. This cluster of the highest quality \"Milky Way\" sites <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkskydiscovery.org.uk/dark-sky-discovery-sites/map.html#sites|title=Dark Sky Discovery Sites|website=Darkskydiscovery.org.uk|access-date=10 November 2017}}</ref> is now well promoted within the island. This government push has effectively given the island a headstart in the number of recognised Dark Sky sites.

It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the {{lang|gv|Mi'raj}} and the {{lang|gv|[[Arkan Sonney]]}}.\n\nAn old Irish story tells how [[Lough Neagh]] was formed when Ireland's legendary giant [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the [[Irish Sea]], thus creating the island.\n\nPeel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian [[Avalon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/avalon.htm|title=Avalon's Location|website=Electricscotland.com|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of [[Lancelot]]'s encounter with the sword bridge of King [[Maleagant]].<ref>King Arthur, Norma Lorre Goodrich, Harper and Row, 1989, p. 318</ref>\n\nOne of the most often-repeated myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend which comes from a Scottish legend, which in turn comes from a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created with the opening of the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|title=Manx witchcraft and sorcery probed by academic - Isle of Man Today<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Iomtoday.co.im|access-date=10 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227154121/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|archivedate=27 December 2015}}</ref> However, there has been a strong tradition of herbalism and the use of charms to prevent and cure illness and disease in people and animals<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/iomnhas/lm3p303.htm|title=Yn Lioar Manninagh: The Journal of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society|last=Nisbet|first=Robert A|last2=Rhys|first2=John|date=1897|publisher=Brown & Sons|isbn=|volume=Vol 3|location=Douglas|pages=303\u2013314|language=English|chapter=Folk-Medicine in the Isle of Man \u2013 A.

A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop. However, its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called {{lang|gv|[[Yn \u00c7hruinnaght]]}} in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceolas.org/Regions/Manx-article.html|title=Trad music in the Isle of Man|website=Ceolas.org|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974.\nThe Isle of Man was mentioned in the [[The Who|Who]] song \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\" as the homeland of the song's titular character, who is always in a state of ecstasy, no matter what happens to him. The song 'The Craic was 90 in the Isle of Man' by [[Christy Moore]] describes a lively visit during the Island's tourism heyday. The Island is also the birthplace of Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, of the [[Bee Gees]].\n\n=== Food ===\nIn the past, the basic national dish of the island was ''spuds and herrin'', boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish was supported by the subsistence farmers of the island, who [[Crofting|crofted]] the land and fished the sea for centuries. A more recent claim for the title of national dish could be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to [[poutine]], is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut [[French fried potatoes|chips]], covered in shredded Manx [[Cheddar cheese]] and topped with a thick gravy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isleofman.com/attractions/cuisine/|title=Attractions :: isleofman.com|last=isleofman.com|website=Isleofman.com|access-date=10 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet.

They established [[Tynwald]] and introduced many land divisions that still exist. In 1266 [[Magnus VI of Norway|King Magnus VI of Norway]] ceded the islands to Scotland in the Treaty of Perth. But Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established until 1275, when the Manx were defeated in the [[Battle of Ronaldsway]], near [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]].\n\nIn 1290 King [[Edward I of England]] sent [[Walter de Huntercombe, 1st Baron Huntercombe|Walter de Huntercombe]] to take possession of Mann. It remained in English hands until 1313, when [[Robert the Bruce|Robert Bruce]] took it after besieging [[Castle Rushen]] for five weeks. A confused period followed when Mann was sometimes under English rule and sometimes Scottish, until 1346, when the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] decided the long struggle between England and Scotland in England's favour.\n\nThe Crown delegated its rule of the island to a series of lords and magnates. [[Tynwald]] passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the [[Lord of Mann]].\n\nIn 1866, the Isle of Man obtained limited home rule, with partly democratic elections to the [[House of Keys]], but the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] was appointed by the Crown.

Before the Protestant Reformation, the island had a long history as part of the unified [[Western Church]], and in the years following the Reformation, the religious authorities on the island, and later the population of the island, accepted the religious authority of the British monarchy and the [[Church of England]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n| last=Moore\n| first=A.\n| title=Diocesan Histories.

The island forms a separate diocese called [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]], which in the distant past comprised the medieval kingdom of Man and the Scottish isles (\"Su\u00f0reyjar\" in Old Norse). It now consists of 16 parishes,<ref>{{cite web | last=Gumbley | first=Ken | title=Diocese of Sodor and Man | website=Welcome to Kirk Braddan | date=2012-03-01 | url=http://www.gumbley.net/diocese.htm | access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> and since 1541<ref>Act of Parliament (1541) 33 Hen.8 c.31</ref> has formed part of the [[Province of York]].<ref>{{cite web | title=England-Sodor & Man | website=Anglican Communion | date=2012-05-28 | url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/diocese.cfm?Idind=214 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528223800/http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/diocese.cfm?Idind=214 | archive-date=2012-05-28 | url-status=unfit | access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> (These modern ecclesiastical parishes do not correspond to the island's ancient parishes mentioned in this article under \"Local Government\", but more closely reflect the current geographical distribution of population.)\n\nOther Christian churches also operate on the Isle of Man. The second largest denomination is the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Church]], whose Isle of Man District is close in numbers to the Anglican diocese. There are eight Catholic parish churches, included in the [[Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite web | title=The Archdiocese of Liverpool  | website=Liverpool Catholic | url=http://www.liverpoolcatholic.org.uk | access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> as well as a presence of [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians. Additionally there are five [[Baptist]] churches, four [[Pentecostal]] churches, the [[Salvation Army]], a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Isle of Man|ward]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], two congregations of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], two [[United Reformed]] churches, as well as other Christian churches. There is a small [[Muslim]] community, with its own mosque in Douglas, and there is also a small [[Jewish]] community, see the [[history of the Jews in the Isle of Man]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml|title=Religious Faiths and Organisations|date=2012-05-28|website=Isle of Man Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608055741/http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml|archive-date=2003-06-08|url-status=unfit|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Myth, legend and folklore ===\n[[File:Isle of Man Peel Castle.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Peel Castle]]]]\nIn Manx mythology, the island was ruled by the sea god [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]], who would draw his misty cloak around the island to protect it from invaders. One of the principal folk theories about the origin of the name ''Mann'' is that it is named after Manann\u00e1n.\n\nIn the Manx tradition of [[folklore]], there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the {{lang|gv|[[Buggane]]}}, a malevolent spirit which, according to legend, blew the roof off St Trinian's Church in a fit of rage; the {{lang|gv|[[Fenodyree]]}}; the {{lang|gv|[[Glashtyn]]}}; and the {{lang|gv|[[Moddey Dhoo]]}}, a [[black dog (ghost)|ghostly black dog]] which wandered the walls and corridors of [[Peel Castle]].\n\nThe Isle of Man is also said to be home to [[mooinjer veggey|fairies]], known locally as \"the little folk\" or \"themselves\". There is a famous [[Fairy Bridge (Isle of Man)|Fairy Bridge]], and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the {{lang|gv|Mi'raj}} and the {{lang|gv|[[Arkan Sonney]]}}.\n\nAn old Irish story tells how [[Lough Neagh]] was formed when Ireland's legendary giant [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the [[Irish Sea]], thus creating the island.\n\nPeel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian [[Avalon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/avalon.htm|title=Avalon's Location|website=Electricscotland.com|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of [[Lancelot]]'s encounter with the sword bridge of King [[Maleagant]].<ref>King Arthur, Norma Lorre Goodrich, Harper and Row, 1989, p. 318</ref>\n\nOne of the most often-repeated myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend which comes from a Scottish legend, which in turn comes from a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created with the opening of the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|title=Manx witchcraft and sorcery probed by academic - Isle of Man Today<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Iomtoday.co.im|access-date=10 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227154121/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|archivedate=27 December 2015}}</ref> However, there has been a strong tradition of herbalism and the use of charms to prevent and cure illness and disease in people and animals<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/iomnhas/lm3p303.htm|title=Yn Lioar Manninagh: The Journal of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society|last=Nisbet|first=Robert A|last2=Rhys|first2=John|date=1897|publisher=Brown & Sons|isbn=|volume=Vol 3|location=Douglas|pages=303\u2013314|language=English|chapter=Folk-Medicine in the Isle of Man \u2013 A.

A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop. However, its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called {{lang|gv|[[Yn \u00c7hruinnaght]]}} in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceolas.org/Regions/Manx-article.html|title=Trad music in the Isle of Man|website=Ceolas.org|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974.\nThe Isle of Man was mentioned in the [[The Who|Who]] song \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\" as the homeland of the song's titular character, who is always in a state of ecstasy, no matter what happens to him. The song 'The Craic was 90 in the Isle of Man' by [[Christy Moore]] describes a lively visit during the Island's tourism heyday. The Island is also the birthplace of Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, of the [[Bee Gees]].\n\n=== Food ===\nIn the past, the basic national dish of the island was ''spuds and herrin'', boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish was supported by the subsistence farmers of the island, who [[Crofting|crofted]] the land and fished the sea for centuries. A more recent claim for the title of national dish could be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to [[poutine]], is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut [[French fried potatoes|chips]], covered in shredded Manx [[Cheddar cheese]] and topped with a thick gravy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isleofman.com/attractions/cuisine/|title=Attractions :: isleofman.com|last=isleofman.com|website=Isleofman.com|access-date=10 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet.
