The goals of skip-stop service were to extend all trips to 242nd Street, to provide faster travel times for a majority of riders, and to improve service reliability through evenly loaded and spaced trains. During 1987 and 1988, analysis was conducted to determine various options for express service along the '''1''', including using the center express track. As part of the plan, express service was to operate weekdays between 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and 7 p.m.. Trips that ended at 137th Street were extended to 242nd Street, which eliminated the need for a significant reduction in service levels at local stops. The 125th Street station, which is located south of 137th Street, would have experienced a reduction in service. The location of all-stop stations and skip-stop stations was done to evenly distribute passengers between the '''1''' and the '''9''', and to accommodate reverse commuting patterns. Stops with ridership greater than 8,000 daily passengers were designated all-stop stations, while less patronized stops were served by either '''1''' or '''9''' trains. One change was made from the 1988 plan: due to community input 181st Street was added as an all-stop station. Express service was expected to save up to 2.5 minutes of travel time, while all-stop stations would see an additional 2.5 minute reduction in waiting time. This would save between six and nine minutes or a 19% travel time reduction. Running express service via the center track was dismissed since the track had not been designed for express service. The track south of 145th Street is not long enough to allow an express train to pass a local, resulting in merging delays at 103rd Street which would eliminate any time saved. In addition, the busiest stops on the route north of 96th Street would be bypassed without any time savings.

The express service was discontinued in 1959. From 1989 to 2005, the '''1''' ran in a [[skip-stop]] service pattern during rush hours, with the '''[[9 (New York City Subway service)|9]]''' providing the complementary skip-stop service on the same route. The '''1''' and '''9''' trains were rerouted after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001; although they had mostly resumed their normal route by 2002, the '''1''' train skipped the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station until 2018.\n\n== Service history ==\n=== Early service ===\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\">\n{| width=\"80\"\n[[File:R12 IRT 1.svg|64px]]\n|-\n|<div class=\"thumbcaption\">Original [[R12 (New York City Subway car)|R12]] to [[R36 (New York City Subway car)|R36]] end rollsign</div>\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhen the New York City Subway [[Early history of the IRT subway|began operation]] between 1904 and 1908, one of the main service patterns was the West Side Branch, which the modern '''1''' train uses.

The goals of skip-stop service were to extend all trips to 242nd Street, to provide faster travel times for a majority of riders, and to improve service reliability through evenly loaded and spaced trains. During 1987 and 1988, analysis was conducted to determine various options for express service along the '''1''', including using the center express track. As part of the plan, express service was to operate weekdays between 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and 7 p.m.. Trips that ended at 137th Street were extended to 242nd Street, which eliminated the need for a significant reduction in service levels at local stops. The 125th Street station, which is located south of 137th Street, would have experienced a reduction in service. The location of all-stop stations and skip-stop stations was done to evenly distribute passengers between the '''1''' and the '''9''', and to accommodate reverse commuting patterns. Stops with ridership greater than 8,000 daily passengers were designated all-stop stations, while less patronized stops were served by either '''1''' or '''9''' trains. One change was made from the 1988 plan: due to community input 181st Street was added as an all-stop station. Express service was expected to save up to 2.5 minutes of travel time, while all-stop stations would see an additional 2.5 minute reduction in waiting time. This would save between six and nine minutes or a 19% travel time reduction. Running express service via the center track was dismissed since the track had not been designed for express service. The track south of 145th Street is not long enough to allow an express train to pass a local, resulting in merging delays at 103rd Street which would eliminate any time saved. In addition, the busiest stops on the route north of 96th Street would be bypassed without any time savings. Extending all-local service to 242nd Street or adding additional trains were dismissed since they would require additional subway cars, which were not available at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/Koch_FILES/08.005.0000.0000268.05.PDF#undefined|title=#1 Broadway/7th Ave Line Skip-Stop Express Service|date=May 4, 1989|website=laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 1989, the MTA Board approved a revised '''1'''/'''9''' skip-stop plan unanimously, with the plan scheduled to take effect on August 21, 1989.

After three years of [[Touring theatre|touring]] they came back to the United Kingdom.\n\n== Chrysalis Theatre Acting School ==\nThe couple studied the formation of the art of [[Voice acting|dramatic speech]] and [[gesture]] created by Austrian philosopher, [[social reformer]], [[Architecture|architect]] and [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925). They started the '''Boundaries Theatre Company''' which became their own drama school in 1975, the Chrysalis Theatre Acting School in the same [[London]] building they had bought in [[Balham]]. The theatre' venue had been used by the [[Spiritualist Association of Great Britain]] until then. The students who came from all over the world such as Japan or certain [[African countries]] included [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actress Luz Altamira or Sir [[Mark Rylance]]. The school lasted for thirty years. In the 1990s both of them gave training in [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[gesture]] to the professional company of the [[Shakespeare's Globe]]. Peter also gave courses in both the United States and throughout Europe during the same period.\n\n== La Cris\u00e1lida ==\nBridgmont supported the '''La Cris\u00e1lida Studio''', the first school focused on the 'Art of [[Speech]]' in [[Spain]], founded by his pupils speech artist '''Luz Altamira''' and [[Goya Awards]]-nominated thespian '''\u00c1lvaro Ramos''' as well as actress and author '''Pilar Altamira''' member of the '[[Anthroposophical Society]] of [[Spain]]'.

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark

Bridgmont met his wife Barbara Brown (Bridgmont) while they were both former company members at the [[Theatre Workshop]] whose long-serving director was [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]s graduate [[Joan Littlewood]] (1914\u20132002) and fellow members included [[Richard Harris]] (1930\u20132002), [[Nigel Hawthorne]] ([[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]; 1929\u20132001), [[George Sewell]] (1924\u20132007), [[David Scase]] (1919\u20132003), [[Victor Spinetti]] (1929\u20132012), [[John Thaw]] ([[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], 1942\u20132002), [[Barbara Windsor]] ([[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]], 1937\u2013), [[Yootha Joyce]] (1927\u20131980), [[Sheila Hancock]] ([[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]],1933\u2013), [[Dudley Foster]] (1924\u20131973), [[Marjie Lawrence]] (1932\u20132010), [[Stephen Lewis (actor)|Stephen Lewis]] (1926\u20132015), [[Ewan MacColl]] (1915\u20131989), [[Murray Melvin]] (1932\u2013), [[Frank Norman]] (1930\u20131980), [[John Junkin]] (1930\u20132006), [[Roy Kinnear]] (1934\u20131988), [[Diana Coupland]] (1928\u20132006), [[Shelagh Delaney]] (1938\u20132011), [[Glynn Edwards]] (1931\u20132018) and [[Howard Goorney]] (1921\u20132007). Many [[Theatre Workshop]] productions were transferred to theatres in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and some like as ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!]]'' and ''[[A Taste of Honey]]'', were made into films.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theatre Royal: 100 Years of Stratford East|last=Coren|first=Michael|publisher=Quartet Books|year=1984|isbn=978-0-7043-2474-9|location=London|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/theatreroyal100y00core}}</ref> Peter was introduced to and worked with one of the pioneers of [[modern dance]] in Europe, [[Rudolf von Laban]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Rezs\u0151 L\u00e1b\u00e1n de V\u00e1raljas''; 1879-1958) through his [[Laban Movement Analysis]], [[Labanotation]] (''Kinetography'') and [[Laban Movement Studies|Laban Movement Study]]. The couple relocated to [[Vence]] ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]: ''Ven\u00e7a'') in the hills of the [[Alpes Maritimes]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the French [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]] between [[Nice]] and [[Antibes]], formed their own [[Mime artist|Mime]] Company and collaborated with [[Modernism|modernist]] [[theatre practitioner]], director and [[scenic designer]] [[Edward Gordon Craig]] ([[Companion of Honour|CH]] [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] 1872\u20131966), the son of actress Dame [[Ellen Terry]] ([[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire|GBE]], 1847\u20131928). After three years of [[Touring theatre|touring]] they came back to the United Kingdom.\n\n== Chrysalis Theatre Acting School ==\nThe couple studied the formation of the art of [[Voice acting|dramatic speech]] and [[gesture]] created by Austrian philosopher, [[social reformer]], [[Architecture|architect]] and [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925). They started the '''Boundaries Theatre Company''' which became their own drama school in 1975, the Chrysalis Theatre Acting School in the same [[London]] building they had bought in [[Balham]]. The theatre' venue had been used by the [[Spiritualist Association of Great Britain]] until then. The students who came from all over the world such as Japan or certain [[African countries]] included [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actress Luz Altamira or Sir [[Mark Rylance]]. The school lasted for thirty years. In the 1990s both of them gave training in [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[gesture]] to the professional company of the [[Shakespeare's Globe]]. Peter also gave courses in both the United States and throughout Europe during the same period.\n\n== La Cris\u00e1lida ==\nBridgmont supported the '''La Cris\u00e1lida Studio''', the first school focused on the 'Art of [[Speech]]' in [[Spain]], founded by his pupils speech artist '''Luz Altamira''' and [[Goya Awards]]-nominated thespian '''\u00c1lvaro Ramos''' as well as actress and author '''Pilar Altamira''' member of the '[[Anthroposophical Society]] of [[Spain]]'.

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark Rylance|last=Rylance|first=Mark|date=27 August 2015|website=Liberation of Acting|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n* ''\"Readers who are interested in the Art of Drama may also wish to refer to The Liberation of The Actor (1992) by Peter Bridgmont\"''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhythms of Learning: What Waldorf Education Offers Children, Parents & Teachers|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|publisher=SteinerBooks|year=1998|isbn=9780880104517|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== British Film Institute Archives ==\nA r\u00e9pertoire of Bridgmont's voice work for the year 1966 is available at the [[British Film Institute]] archives as follows:\n* 1966: ''The Sword Must Be Kept Sharp'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]].\n* 1966: ''What Did Greece Matter?'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''It Will Proceed to the End'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''One Perplexity after Another'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''We Are on the Edge of a Precipice'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Not a Penny off the Pay'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''It Has Advanced the Footlights'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Your Death Knell Has Sounded'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''War Is Re-enthroned'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''We Neither Govern Not Misgovern'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''The Popular Masses Are Dull'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Germany Is Reawakening'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''There Lies a Sleeping Giant'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Who Can Conquer the Street...'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''On the Idle Hill of Summer'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''Make Room for Peace'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''There Is a Great Tide Turning'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''This Is Such a Time'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''Boys You Have Been Betrayed'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''Now I Can Die'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''Long Live the War'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''What Hand Would Not Wither'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]], Robert Ayres and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc891e6a8|title=Voice work 1966 Bridgmont|date=1 January 2017|website=British Film Institute (BFI)|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n* The documentary on Peter and Barbara directed by [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actor and director \u00c1lvaro Ramos which was eponymously titled '''The Chrysalis''' (2009) won the Best Documentary award at the High Desert International Film Festival in [[Nevada]], United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clandestinodeactores.com/alvaro-ramos|title=Alvaro's work|date=5 May 2015|website=Clandestino de Actores|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nPeter's son, Andrew Bridgmont, is also an accomplished actor himself who notably starred in [[Matthew Vaughn]]'s ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]'' (2014), [[James Marsh (director)|James Marsh]]'s ''[[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)|The Theory of Everything]]'' (2014) or ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014\u20132016).\n\n== External links ==\n* Bridgmont's [http://www.liberationofacting.com/ official website].\n\n== Sources ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bridgmont, Peter}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century English male actors]]\n[[Category:English male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:English male film actors]]\n[[Category:English male Shakespearean actors]]\n[[Category:English male stage actors]]\n[[Category:English male television actors]]\n[[Category:English theatre directors]]\n[[Category:Royal Shakespeare Company members]]\n[[Category:Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "\u62d3\u8dcb\u6c0f \u99ac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bridgmont"}

With the rerouting of '''3''' trains, train lengths along the New Lots Line were reduced from 10 cars to 9 cars, within acceptable crowding levels, and train lengths along the Nostrand Avenue Line were increased from 9 to 10 cars, reducing crowding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1983|title=New IRT Schedules - Increased Service to Flatbush Avenue|url=|journal=New York Division Bulletin|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%252000253_1.pdf%23xml%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3Dffffffffa28002b6%26DocId%3D6932839%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D11%26hits%3D5fa%2B5fb%2B5fc%2B5fd%2B5fe%2B5ff%2B600%2B601%2B602%2B603%2B604%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Amsterdam%2520News%25201983%252000253_1.pdf&xml=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3Dffffffffa28002b6%26DocId%3D6932839%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D11%26hits%3D5fa%2B5fb%2B5fc%2B5fd%2B5fe%2B5ff%2B600%2B601%2B602%2B603%2B604%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&openFirstHlPage=false|title=Notice of Public Hearing|last=|first=|date=February 26, 1983|work=New York Amsterdam News|access-date=January 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn Spring 1995, rush hour '''5''' service to 241st Street was cut back to [[Nereid Avenue station|Nereid Avenue]]. 241st Street had insufficient capacity to terminate all '''2''' and '''5''' trains during rush hours, requiring some '''2''' and '''5''' trips to terminate at Nereid Avenue. To ease passenger confusion regarding which trips terminate where and to provide more reliable service, it was decided to have all '''2''' trips terminate at 241st Street and have all '''5''' trains terminate at 238th Street.

Dyre Avenue-bound '''5''' trains would start running local along the White Plains Road Line, while '''2''' trains would run express. Nereid Avenue-bound '''5''' trains would continue to run express in the Bronx. As part of the change, the frequency of service at White Plains Road Line local station would decrease from 12 trains per hour to 7 trains per hour. Market research showed that riders at these stations preferred Lexington Avenue Line service. In addition, riders on the line north of East 180th Street would gain express service.

Two options were discussed at the hearing. The commission, in response to intense requests from riders on the line, called for the introduction of express service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue on tracks which had been unused since the line's opening in 1920. It proposed extending half of '''4''' trains from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue, running express to Utica Avenue. The introduction of express service would have made it possible to run 30 more trains per hour east of Atlantic Avenue (27 trains per hour had been operating), decreasing overcrowding from 325% to 185%. The plan preferred by the IRT was to place 70 cars on the West Side Line for service to Flatbush Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue and New Lots Avenue, and 40 additional cars for service along Eastern Parkway.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414638/times-union/|title=I.R.T.

The IRT stated that two minutes would not be enough time to turn around trains terminating at Atlantic Avenue while maintaining the headway between trains and that this service pattern would risk train collisions. Operating this service pattern would have required 2 minutes and 45 seconds to turn around trains, which would reduce capacity by 25%.

During a one hour period, four morning weekday rush hour trains from Woodlawn only stopped at Mosholu Parkway, Burnside Avenue and 149th Street\u2013Grand Concourse before resuming regular service in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The express was expected to save riders 3.5 minutes. The pilot was made possible due to signaling upgrades to the line's center track made as part of the 2005\u20142009 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program.<ref name=\"MTA-June2009Pilot\">{{cite press release|title=MTA New York City Transit Pilots Bronx Express Service Along the Jerome Ave. Line|url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-new-york-city-transit-pilots-bronx-express-service-along-jerome-ave|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/events/BronxExpressPilot.htm|title=Bronx Express Pilot Program June 8 to 26, Monday to Friday, 7 AM to 8 AM|last=|first=|date=June 10, 2009|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610212200/http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/events/BronxExpressPilot.htm|archivedate=June 10, 2009|access-date=September 23, 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn July 6, 2009, select Bronx bound '''4''' trains began running express from 167th Street to Burnside Avenue to terminate at the latter station before running out of service to the Jerome Yard.\n\nOn October 26, 2009, another '''4''' express pilot program was implemented based on the success of the first and ran until December 11, 2009.

Two options were discussed at the hearing. The commission, in response to intense requests from riders on the line, called for the introduction of express service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue on tracks which had been unused since the line's opening in 1920. It proposed extending half of '''4''' trains from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue, running express to Utica Avenue. The introduction of express service would have made it possible to run 30 more trains per hour east of Atlantic Avenue (27 trains per hour had been operating), decreasing overcrowding from 325% to 185%. The plan preferred by the IRT was to place 70 cars on the West Side Line for service to Flatbush Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue and New Lots Avenue, and 40 additional cars for service along Eastern Parkway.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414638/times-union/|title=I.R.T.

The IRT stated that two minutes would not be enough time to turn around trains terminating at Atlantic Avenue while maintaining the headway between trains and that this service pattern would risk train collisions. Operating this service pattern would have required 2 minutes and 45 seconds to turn around trains, which would reduce capacity by 25%. While operating all '''4''' trains to Utica Avenue would have obviated the problem, the IRT did not have enough cars to run such a service.
