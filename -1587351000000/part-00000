C. G. Nurse, the Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History) have received a bequest of 3,000 Indian insects mostly obtained at Quetta, [[Deesa]] and [[Jabalpur|Jubbulpore]], where Col. Nurse served with the Indian Army. Col. Nurse was one of the small band of naturalists among military officers who devoted their leisure to the study of entomology, and was an enthusiastic collector of Hymenoptera, forming a large and valuable collection which he presented to the Museum a few years ago. The present bequest comprises the remainder of his Indian insects and includes about 1,450 [[Fly|Diptera]] (two winged flies), 1,300 butterflies, 130 dragon-flies and some others; of these the most valuable are the Diptera. The collection is especially rich in species of the family [[Bombyliidae]], most of which are parasitic in the larval state on bees or wasps. Col. Nurse discovered and described fourteen species of this family which were new to science, and [[Type (biology)|types]] of these are in the collection, as well as specimens of a number of other flies which were not previously represented in the Museum. Some interesting butterflies and other insects from Aden are included. \u2013 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], 1934.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 March 1934|title=Recent Acquisitions at the Natural History Museum|url=|journal=Nature|volume=133|pages=323\u2013 323|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Societies==\nNurse was a member of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]] (Managing Committee).

C. G. Nurse, the Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History) have received a bequest of 3,000 Indian insects mostly obtained at Quetta, [[Deesa]] and [[Jabalpur|Jubbulpore]], where Col. Nurse served with the Indian Army. Col. Nurse was one of the small band of naturalists among military officers who devoted their leisure to the study of entomology, and was an enthusiastic collector of Hymenoptera, forming a large and valuable collection which he presented to the Museum a few years ago. The present bequest comprises the remainder of his Indian insects and includes about 1,450 [[Fly|Diptera]] (two winged flies), 1,300 butterflies, 130 dragon-flies and some others; of these the most valuable are the Diptera. The collection is especially rich in species of the family [[Bombyliidae]], most of which are parasitic in the larval state on bees or wasps. Col. Nurse discovered and described fourteen species of this family which were new to science, and [[Type (biology)|types]] of these are in the collection, as well as specimens of a number of other flies which were not previously represented in the Museum. Some interesting butterflies and other insects from Aden are included. \u2013 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], 1934.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 March 1934|title=Recent Acquisitions at the Natural History Museum|url=|journal=Nature|volume=133|pages=323\u2013 323|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Societies==\nNurse was a member of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]] (Managing Committee).

Its growth since that time falls into two periods, each lasting approximately 100 years. The first witnessed development of the borough as an [[iron-making]] center.  The second, which extends to the present day, is as a [[papermaking]] center. The businesses of both periods have relied on certain [[natural resource]]s of the area.\n\nOriginally, Spring Grove was a part of Paradise Township and was contained within the boundaries of [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. York County was formed in 1749 and [[Jackson Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Jackson Township]], including Spring Grove, in 1853. The residents of the community petitioned the County Court in 1882 for incorporation as a borough, and in August of that year their petition was granted. Since that time, the borough has grown in area as a result of [[annexation]] of the surrounding land, the largest annexation having taken place in 1953.\n\nIn the 1770s, attracted by the presence of water, [[iron ore]] and wood for [[charcoal]] in the Pigeon Hills, an iron manufacturer established a [[forge]] at \"Spring Forge\". It is known as Spring Grove. The early German and English woodchoppers who flocked to this first Pennsylvania iron industry west of the [[Susquehanna River]] were the forebears of today's community. By the mid-19th century, the manufacturing of iron had grown to a point where almost {{convert|200|ST|kg|sp=us}} of iron bar were produced locally each year.\n\nBy 1851, however, the iron business had been suspended, and its buildings were converted to the manufacturing of paper. Once again local resources, wood and water, were largely responsible for the location of this industry in the Spring Grove area. Thirteen years later, the plant was purchased by P. H. [[Glatfelter]] for $14,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/P._H._Glatfelter_Company.aspx|title=P. H. Glatfelter Company Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about P. H. Glatfelter Company|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\nOther basic industries, such as brick-making and the manufacture of explosives, have from time to time established themselves in the borough.

Its growth since that time falls into two periods, each lasting approximately 100 years. The first witnessed development of the borough as an [[iron-making]] center.  The second, which extends to the present day, is as a [[papermaking]] center. The businesses of both periods have relied on certain [[natural resource]]s of the area.\n\nOriginally, Spring Grove was a part of Paradise Township and was contained within the boundaries of [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. York County was formed in 1749 and [[Jackson Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Jackson Township]], including Spring Grove, in 1853. The residents of the community petitioned the County Court in 1882 for incorporation as a borough, and in August of that year their petition was granted. Since that time, the borough has grown in area as a result of [[annexation]] of the surrounding land, the largest annexation having taken place in 1953.\n\nIn the 1770s, attracted by the presence of water, [[iron ore]] and wood for [[charcoal]] in the Pigeon Hills, an iron manufacturer established a [[forge]] at \"Spring Forge\". It is known as Spring Grove. The early German and English woodchoppers who flocked to this first Pennsylvania iron industry west of the [[Susquehanna River]] were the forebears of today's community. By the mid-19th century, the manufacturing of iron had grown to a point where almost {{convert|200|ST|kg|sp=us}} of iron bar were produced locally each year.\n\nBy 1851, however, the iron business had been suspended, and its buildings were converted to the manufacturing of paper. Once again local resources, wood and water, were largely responsible for the location of this industry in the Spring Grove area. Thirteen years later, the plant was purchased by P. H. [[Glatfelter]] for $14,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/P._H._Glatfelter_Company.aspx|title=P. H.

None, however, have remained as long nor have been as successful as the paper mill. Since 1865, the growth of the borough has reflected growth of the Glatfelter Paper Mill.\n\nIn August 2018, Glatfelder announced an agreement to sell its Specialty Papers division, which includes the Spring Grove mill, to private investment firm [[Lindsay Goldberg]] for $360 million, with the sale to close before 2019.

Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]]. Before takeoff, Alex has a [[Precognition|premonition]] that the plane will explode in mid-air, killing everybody on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter|Carter Horton]]. As a result, several passengers are removed from the plane, including Alex, Carter, Alex's best friend [[List of Final Destination characters#Tod|Tod Waggner]], Carter's girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Terry|Terry Chaney]], teacher [[List of Final Destination characters#Valerie|Valerie Lewton]], and students [[List of Final Destination characters#Billy|Billy Hitchcock]] and [[Clear Rivers]]. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believes Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on takeoff, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterward, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex had something to do with the explosion.\n\nThirty-nine days later, the survivors attend a memorial service for the victims. That night, an unusual chain reaction causes Tod to be strangled to death in his shower. His death is deemed a suicide, but Alex does not believe that Tod killed himself. He and Clear sneak into the funeral home to see Tod's body, where they meet [[Funeral director|mortician]] [[William Bludworth]]. He tells them that they have cheated Death's plan and Death is now taking the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane.\n\nThe next day, Alex and Clear discuss what the mortician said at a caf\u00e9. Although Clear is skeptical, Alex believes that they can cheat Death again if they look out for [[omen]]s. They encounter the rest of the survivors and, when Carter provokes Alex, Terry berates him before storming off in anger and getting run over by a speeding bus.\n\nAfter watching a news report on the cause of the explosion, Alex realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the plane. He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to no good, Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who bring him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening, they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled by a falling kitchen knife.\n\nThe remaining survivors reunite and discuss what to do while driving through town. During the conversation, Carter learns he is next on Death's list. Frustrated over not having control over his life, Carter stops his car on railroad tracks, wanting to die on his own terms. He changes his mind at the last minute but cannot get out when his seatbelt jams. Alex manages to save Carter just before the car is smashed by an oncoming train, and Billy is decapitated by flying [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]. Alex deduces that, because he intervened, Death skipped Carter and moved on to Billy, and he realizes he is next on Death's list.\n\nLater, while hiding out in a fortified cabin, Alex recalls changing seats with two girls in his premonition, meaning Clear is actually next, and he rushes to save her while being chased by the agents. Meanwhile, Clear is stuck inside her car with a leaking gas tank, surrounded by loose electrical cables. Alex arrives at her house just in time and grabs the cable, allowing her to escape from the car just before it explodes.\n\nSix months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to [[Paris]] to celebrate their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex realizes that Death never skipped him. After seeing more omens, he leaves the table, and a bus almost hits him, but it swerves and crashes into a large neon sign that swings down towards Alex. Carter pushes Alex out of the way at the last second, and Alex says that Death has skipped him. When Carter asks who is next, the sign swings back down towards Carter, and the screen cuts to black followed by a loud smash, leaving Alex and Clear as the last survivors of Flight 180.\n\n==Cast==\n{{for|more details on the characters|List of Final Destination characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Devon Sawa]] as [[Alex Browning]] \n* [[Ali Larter]] as [[Clear Rivers]]\n* [[Kerr Smith]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Horton|Carter Horton]] \n* [[Kristen Cloke]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Valerie Lewton|Valerie Lewton]]\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Agent Weine|Agent Weine]]\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Agent Schreck|Agent Schrek]]\n* [[Chad Donella|Chad E.

We didn't want a guy in a dark cloak or some kind of monster chasing after these kids. That's been done again and again. I became very excited when we decided to make the world at large, in the service of death, our antagonist. Everyday objects and occurrences then take on ominous proportions and it becomes less about whether or not our characters are going to die and more about how they will die and how they can delay their deaths. The entertainment value is in the 'ride' not in the outcome, and by placing the premise of the film on the inevitability of death, we play a certain philosophical note\".\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2014 James Wong on how he accepted the directing and writing privileges for the film.<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n|}\nThe original idea was written by Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for ''[[The X-Files]]'' in order to get a TV agent. \"I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don't take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.' She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed,\" said Reddick. \"I thought, that\u2019s creepy\u2014what if she was supposed to die on that flight?\"<ref name=\"Disgusting\" /> Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to ''[[The X-Files]]'' after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film.\n\nNew Line Cinema bought Jeffrey's treatment and hired him to write the original draft of the script, which featured Death as an unseen force. After the script was finished, New Line Cinema submitted the script to directors, including writing partners [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] and [[Glen Morgan]]. Both writers were willing to make it into a film, although they rewrote the script to comply with their standards. \"I believe that at one time or another we've all experienced a sense of prescience. We have a hunch, a feeling, and then that hunch proves true,\" Wong said. \"We want to do for planes and air travel what ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' did for sharks and swimming\".\n\nMorgan said, \"The main thing they wanted about Death coming to get people is that you never saw a kind of a [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] figure. You never saw a killer. And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started cataloging the strange coincidences in my own life. For example, I was in the [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver airport]] waiting for a flight when [[John Denver]] came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just died in a plane crash \u2013 that's a little weird.' We wrote that version of that experience into the script.\"<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nProducers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from [[Zide/Perry Productions]] helped with the film's budget because both were similarly fascinated about the idea of an invisible force executing its victims.

Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in ''Idle Hands'', and Sawa was hired.<ref name=\"XFiles\" />\n\nSawa described his role as \"in the beginning, [Alex] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think he might have been a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes\". \"Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible,\" Wong said. \"He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" /> Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as \"a very distinctive actor.

She defined her part as \"that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself and had made a life within that.

The writers eventually changed it for Scott.<ref name=\"Disc\" />\n\n''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' star Kerr Smith was cast as jock Carter Horton.

To serve the subtleties of the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of \"skewing\" the sets. \"What I've tried to do with the sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural,\" Willet explained. \"Nothing that calls attention to itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness\u2014the unsettling feeling that something's not quite right\". To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set\u2014one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n\"On the skewed sets I force the perspective either vertically or horizontally,\" Willet explained. \"Nothing is square and, although you can't put your finger on it, it just makes you feel like something is not right\". Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. \"In the real world, the colors are bright and rich,\" Willet said. \"In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic\".<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:FD Prop 747 Plane.jpg|right|thumb|300x200px|The crew of the film used a miniature model of the Boeing 747 used by the actors for the plane explosion scene.

The explosion was captured by four high-frame cameras rather than simple ones to let the audience visualize slowly the \"crescendo\" of the explosion.<ref name=\"XFiles\" />]] -->\nThe plane scene during which passengers die in mid-air was created inside a very large [[sound stage]]. The three-ton hydraulic [[gimbal]] was operated automatically. \"We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people,\" [[special effect]]s supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the onboard sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees front-to-back, realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. Sawa said that \"the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real\". Wong said, \"You walk into the studio and there's a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think, 'What have I done?' I was afraid we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting.\"<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nA miniature model of the [[Boeing 747]] airplane was created for the explosion scene.

If blowing up a four-foot plane, the explosion must be a minimum of eight feet in the air. To film the explosion in detail, the crew used three cameras running 120 frames per second and one camera running 300 frames per second (if they had filmed using a real-time camera, the succession of the explosion would not be filmed in a particular order).<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" />\n\nThe train scene (in which Carter's car is smashed by the train) was one of the most difficult scenes to shoot. The car used for the crash was a replica of the original, severed in half prior to filming. According to Sonderhoff, in order to ensure the safety of the actors, they had to make sure that there was no real sheet metal in the car.<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nFor the death scenes, the crew used several lifecasts of the actors and [[chocolate syrup]] for [[fake blood]].

[[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]], with a screenplay written by James Wong, [[Glen Morgan]], and [[Jeffrey Reddick]], based on a story by Reddick. It is the first installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]] and stars [[Devon Sawa]], [[Ali Larter]], [[Kerr Smith]], and [[Tony Todd]]. Sawa portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a [[premonition]] of a catastrophic plane explosion. He and several of his classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but [[Death (personification)|Death]] later takes the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane.\n\nThe film began as a [[spec script]] written by Reddick for an episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', in order for Reddick to get a TV agent. A colleague at New Line Cinema persuaded Reddick to write it as a feature-length film. Later, Wong and Morgan, ''The X-Files'' writing partners, became interested in the script and agreed to rewrite and direct the film, marking Wong's film directing debut.<ref name=\"XFiles\">{{cite video|people=James Wong (director)|title=Final Destination: A Look at Test Screening|medium=Videotape / DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema|location=[[New York City|New York]], USA}}</ref><ref name=\"Disc\">{{cite video|people = James Wong (director)|title = Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0780631684|medium=DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema|location=[[New York City|New York]], USA|accessdate =April 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Disgusting\">{{cite web|title=Special Feature \u2018Final Destination\u2019: Not So Final After All!|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Angel\">{{cite web|title=Final Destination Press Book|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/stars/chaddonella/flight180/press/book.html|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> Filming took place in [[New York City]] and [[Vancouver]], with additional scenes filmed in [[Toronto]] and [[San Francisco]].

The first sequel, ''[[Final Destination 2]]'', was released on January 31, 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nOn May 13, 2000, high school student [[Alex Browning]] boards Vol\u00e9e Airlines [[Boeing 747#747-200|Boeing 747]] Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] from New York [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]]. Before takeoff, Alex has a [[Precognition|premonition]] that the plane will explode in mid-air, killing everybody on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter|Carter Horton]]. As a result, several passengers are removed from the plane, including Alex, Carter, Alex's best friend [[List of Final Destination characters#Tod|Tod Waggner]], Carter's girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Terry|Terry Chaney]], teacher [[List of Final Destination characters#Valerie|Valerie Lewton]], and students [[List of Final Destination characters#Billy|Billy Hitchcock]] and [[Clear Rivers]]. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believes Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on takeoff, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterward, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex had something to do with the explosion.\n\nThirty-nine days later, the survivors attend a memorial service for the victims. That night, an unusual chain reaction causes Tod to be strangled to death in his shower. His death is deemed a suicide, but Alex does not believe that Tod killed himself. He and Clear sneak into the funeral home to see Tod's body, where they meet [[Funeral director|mortician]] [[William Bludworth]]. He tells them that they have cheated Death's plan and Death is now taking the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane.\n\nThe next day, Alex and Clear discuss what the mortician said at a caf\u00e9. Although Clear is skeptical, Alex believes that they can cheat Death again if they look out for [[omen]]s. They encounter the rest of the survivors and, when Carter provokes Alex, Terry berates him before storming off in anger and getting run over by a speeding bus.\n\nAfter watching a news report on the cause of the explosion, Alex realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the plane. He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to no good, Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who bring him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening, they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled by a falling kitchen knife.\n\nThe remaining survivors reunite and discuss what to do while driving through town. During the conversation, Carter learns he is next on Death's list. Frustrated over not having control over his life, Carter stops his car on railroad tracks, wanting to die on his own terms. He changes his mind at the last minute but cannot get out when his seatbelt jams. Alex manages to save Carter just before the car is smashed by an oncoming train, and Billy is decapitated by flying [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]. Alex deduces that, because he intervened, Death skipped Carter and moved on to Billy, and he realizes he is next on Death's list.\n\nLater, while hiding out in a fortified cabin, Alex recalls changing seats with two girls in his premonition, meaning Clear is actually next, and he rushes to save her while being chased by the agents. Meanwhile, Clear is stuck inside her car with a leaking gas tank, surrounded by loose electrical cables. Alex arrives at her house just in time and grabs the cable, allowing her to escape from the car just before it explodes.\n\nSix months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to [[Paris]] to celebrate their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex realizes that Death never skipped him. After seeing more omens, he leaves the table, and a bus almost hits him, but it swerves and crashes into a large neon sign that swings down towards Alex. Carter pushes Alex out of the way at the last second, and Alex says that Death has skipped him. When Carter asks who is next, the sign swings back down towards Carter, and the screen cuts to black followed by a loud smash, leaving Alex and Clear as the last survivors of Flight 180.\n\n==Cast==\n{{for|more details on the characters|List of Final Destination characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Devon Sawa]] as [[Alex Browning]] \n* [[Ali Larter]] as [[Clear Rivers]]\n* [[Kerr Smith]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Horton|Carter Horton]] \n* [[Kristen Cloke]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Valerie Lewton|Valerie Lewton]]\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Agent Weine|Agent Weine]]\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as [[List of Final Destination characters#Agent Schreck|Agent Schrek]]\n* [[Chad Donella|Chad E.

We didn't want a guy in a dark cloak or some kind of monster chasing after these kids. That's been done again and again. I became very excited when we decided to make the world at large, in the service of death, our antagonist. Everyday objects and occurrences then take on ominous proportions and it becomes less about whether or not our characters are going to die and more about how they will die and how they can delay their deaths. The entertainment value is in the 'ride' not in the outcome, and by placing the premise of the film on the inevitability of death, we play a certain philosophical note\".\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2014 James Wong on how he accepted the directing and writing privileges for the film.<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n|}\nThe original idea was written by Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for ''[[The X-Files]]'' in order to get a TV agent. \"I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don't take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.' She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed,\" said Reddick. \"I thought, that\u2019s creepy\u2014what if she was supposed to die on that flight?\"<ref name=\"Disgusting\" /> Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to ''[[The X-Files]]'' after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film.\n\nNew Line Cinema bought Jeffrey's treatment and hired him to write the original draft of the script, which featured Death as an unseen force. After the script was finished, New Line Cinema submitted the script to directors, including writing partners [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] and [[Glen Morgan]]. Both writers were willing to make it into a film, although they rewrote the script to comply with their standards. \"I believe that at one time or another we've all experienced a sense of prescience. We have a hunch, a feeling, and then that hunch proves true,\" Wong said. \"We want to do for planes and air travel what ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' did for sharks and swimming\".\n\nMorgan said, \"The main thing they wanted about Death coming to get people is that you never saw a kind of a [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] figure. You never saw a killer. And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started cataloging the strange coincidences in my own life. For example, I was in the [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver airport]] waiting for a flight when [[John Denver]] came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just died in a plane crash \u2013 that's a little weird.' We wrote that version of that experience into the script.\"<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nProducers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from [[Zide/Perry Productions]] helped with the film's budget because both were similarly fascinated about the idea of an invisible force executing its victims. Perry, a fan of ''The X-Files'', claimed that he \"responded to Wong and Morgan's work for one specific reason: dread\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disgusting\" /> [[New Line Cinema]] accepted financing and distributing rights for the film after Reddick came to them personally.<ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:FD Flight Survivors.jpg|thumb|right|300x200px|A screenshot from the film showing the main cast: (from left to right) [[Kristen Cloke]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Valerie|Ms. Valerie Lewton]], [[Seann William Scott]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Billy|Billy Hitchcock]], [[Kerr Smith]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Carter|Carter Horton]], [[Amanda Detmer]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Terry|Terry Chaney]], [[Ali Larter]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Clear|Clear Rivers]], [[Devon Sawa]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Alex|Alex Browning]], and [[Chad Donella]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Tod|Tod Waggner]].]]\n{{main|List of characters in the Final Destination series#Final Destination (2000)|l1=List of characters in Final Destination}}\n\"One of the most important things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties \u2013 the little things that a character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you,\" Morgan said about the auditions.\n\nAlex Browning, the last role cast, went to Canadian actor [[Devon Sawa]], who previously starred in the 1999 film ''[[Idle Hands]]''. Sawa said that when \"[he] read the script on a plane, [he] found [himself] peeking out the window at the engine every couple of minutes\" and \"[he] went down and met Glen and Jim and [he] thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas\".<ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Devon\">{{cite web|last=DevonSawa.org|first=Starshine|title=Starshine Devon Sawa \u2013 Auditions|url=http://www.devonsawa.org/about-devon/auditions/|accessdate=April 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316075521/http://www.devonsawa.org/about-devon/auditions/|archive-date=March 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in ''Idle Hands'', and Sawa was hired.<ref name=\"XFiles\" />\n\nSawa described his role as \"in the beginning, [Alex] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think he might have been a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes\". \"Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible,\" Wong said. \"He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" /> Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as \"a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" />\n\n[[Ali Larter]], who starred in the 1999 film ''[[Varsity Blues (film)|Varsity Blues]]'', was cast as female lead [[Clear Rivers]]. \"The film shows how easy it is to turn on someone, to blame someone when you're scared,\" Larter said. \"It's also about trusting your intuitions and yourself\". She defined her part as \"that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself and had made a life within that. She's an artist, she lives by herself, and she's kinda holding to her grip for what the world has given her\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nSeann William Scott, famous for portraying [[Steve Stifler]] in the 1999 film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', was hired as class clown Billy Hitchcock. Scott admired the film and felt that \"it's [as] dark and eerie as any ''Twilight Zone''\".<ref name=\"Angel\" /> He laughed at his role, saying that \"[he] is lacking some social skills, he doesn't have quite a few friends, and he's like the tag-along\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /> Scott was surprised when in the script his character was written as fat. The writers eventually changed it for Scott.<ref name=\"Disc\" />\n\n''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' star Kerr Smith was cast as jock Carter Horton.

As an actor, I can find a way to get there if I know specifically what I'm going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won't move on until he's got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things\". Cloke described her part as \"strong and sassy \u2013 in control. After the crash, she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that\".<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nNewcomers [[Amanda Detmer]] and [[Chad Donella|Chad E. Donella]] were cast as students Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively.<ref name=\"Cast\" /> \"When I first read the script, the thing that struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable,\" Detmer said. \"That's important because you have to care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them\". Detmer defined Terry as \"very put-together [and] seems content to defer to [Carter] \u2013 to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her\".<ref name=\"Angel\" /> On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. \"I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan\".<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\n[[Tony Todd]], who played Candyman in the 1992 film ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'', was cast as mortician William Bludworth.<ref name=\"Cast\" /> Morgan initially wanted Todd for the role because he felt his deep voice would give the film an eerie tone.<ref name=\"Disc\" />\n\nAdditional cast members included [[Daniel Roebuck]] and [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as FBI agents Agent Weine and Agent Schreck; [[Brendan Fehr]], [[Christine Chatelain]] and Lisa Marie Caruk as students George Waggner, Blake Dreyer, and Christa Marsh; [[Barbara Tyson]] and [[Robert Wisden]] as Barbara and Ken Browning, Alex' parents; and Forbes Angus as teacher Larry Murnau.<ref name=\"Cast\" />\n\n[[File:Vancouver International Airport Aerial.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The film mentioned [[John F.

The cast members were filming other projects during production, so filming schedules had to be moved repeatedly for all of the cast to appear. Sawa restrained his appearance in ''[[The Guilty (2000 film)|The Guilty]]'' during production, and even commented that \"[he] had to share a trailer with [[Bill Pullman]] because it was bigger and would make him look more famous\".<ref name=\"Devon\" /> Smith, who was a regular in ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', had to hold episodes for the film.<ref name=\"Dawson\">{{cite web|publisher=Sony Entertainment|work=Dawson's Creek|title=Dawson's Creek Official Website|url=http://www.dawsonscreek.com/|accessdate=April 20, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CKeUfQwt?url=http://www.dawsonscreek.com/|archive-date=November 21, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Detmer, her death scene (being rammed by a speeding bus) was filmed first because \"it was easy but much anticipated\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /> All death scenes were filmed using [[lifecasting|lifecasts]] of the actual actors.<ref name=\"XFiles\" /> The death scenes, the memorial, the forest scene and the scenes in [[Paris]] were all filmed in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].<ref name=\"Disc\" /> Additional scenes were filmed in [[Toronto]] and [[San Francisco]].<ref name=\"Disc\" /> For the airport, the crew used [[Vancouver International Airport]] as a stand-in for [[John F.

To serve the subtleties of the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of \"skewing\" the sets. \"What I've tried to do with the sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural,\" Willet explained. \"Nothing that calls attention to itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness\u2014the unsettling feeling that something's not quite right\". To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set\u2014one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n\"On the skewed sets I force the perspective either vertically or horizontally,\" Willet explained. \"Nothing is square and, although you can't put your finger on it, it just makes you feel like something is not right\". Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. \"In the real world, the colors are bright and rich,\" Willet said. \"In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic\".<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:FD Prop 747 Plane.jpg|right|thumb|300x200px|The crew of the film used a miniature model of the Boeing 747 used by the actors for the plane explosion scene. The model was lifted 40 feet up in the air and lit. The explosion was captured by four high-frame cameras rather than simple ones to let the audience visualize slowly the \"crescendo\" of the explosion.<ref name=\"XFiles\" />]] -->\nThe plane scene during which passengers die in mid-air was created inside a very large [[sound stage]]. The three-ton hydraulic [[gimbal]] was operated automatically. \"We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people,\" [[special effect]]s supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the onboard sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees front-to-back, realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. Sawa said that \"the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real\". Wong said, \"You walk into the studio and there's a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think, 'What have I done?' I was afraid we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting.\"<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nA miniature model of the [[Boeing 747]] airplane was created for the explosion scene. The model, one of the most detailed miniature scenes in the film, was about 10 feet long and 7 feet wide, and the landing gear was made from all machined metals.<ref name=\"Prop\">{{cite web|last=YourProps.com|first=Your Props|title=Final Destination (2000), Original Screen Used 747 Used During Production, original/screen-us|url=http://www.yourprops.com/Original-Screen-Used-747-Used-During-Production-original---screen-used-movie-props-Final-Destination--2000--prop-47725.html|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> According to [[visual effects]] supervisor Ariel Velasco Shaw, the miniature had to be launched about 40 feet up into the air to make it look like a real Boeing 747 exploded into a fireball. If blowing up a four-foot plane, the explosion must be a minimum of eight feet in the air. To film the explosion in detail, the crew used three cameras running 120 frames per second and one camera running 300 frames per second (if they had filmed using a real-time camera, the succession of the explosion would not be filmed in a particular order).<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" />\n\nThe train scene (in which Carter's car is smashed by the train) was one of the most difficult scenes to shoot. The car used for the crash was a replica of the original, severed in half prior to filming. According to Sonderhoff, in order to ensure the safety of the actors, they had to make sure that there was no real sheet metal in the car.<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nFor the death scenes, the crew used several lifecasts of the actors and [[chocolate syrup]] for [[fake blood]]. Creating the [[Rube Goldberg]] effect for Ms. Lewton's death scene was the most difficult to plan according to the crew. Perry said that \"it was very hard to generate an atmosphere of dread, to create suspense out of scenes that are common\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disc\" />\n\n===Music===\n\n====Soundtrack====\nNo official album accompanied the motion picture.
