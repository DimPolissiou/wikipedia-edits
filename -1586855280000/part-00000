Dostoevsky's literary works explore [[human psychology]] in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of [[Russian Empire|19th-century Russia]], and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed works include ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), ''[[The Idiot]]'' (1869), [[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|''Demons'']] (1872), and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880). Dostoevsky's body of works consists of 11 novels, three novellas, 17 short stories, and numerous other works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest [[psychologist]]s in [[world literature]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dostoevsky the Thinker: A Philosophical Study|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23116-dostoevsky-the-thinker/|last=Scanlan|first=James Patrick|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8014-3994-0}}</ref> His 1864 novella ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' is considered to be one of the first works of [[existentialism|existentialist]] literature.\n\nBorn in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through [[fairy tales]] and [[legend]]s, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute]]. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'', which gained him entry into [[St. Petersburg]]'s literary circles. Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group that discussed banned books critical of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], he was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later ''[[A Writer's Diary]]'', a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a [[gambling addiction]], which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers.\n\nDostoevsky was influenced by a wide variety of philosophers and authors including [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]], [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Plato]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Vissarion Belinsky|Belinsky]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]], [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]]. His writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians like [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] as well as philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Maria Fyodorovna Dostoyevskaya.jpg\n| width1 = 116\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Maria Fyodorovna Dostoevskaya\n| image2 = Mikhail Andreyevich Dostoyevsky.jpg\n| width2 = 116\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Mikhail Andreyevich Dostoevsky\n| footer = \n}}\n\nDostoevsky's parents were part of a multi-ethnic and multi-denominational noble family, its branches including [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christians, [[Lithuanian nobility]], Polish [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435|url=http://www.klassika.ru/cgi-bin/bio.pl?type=search&string=%C4%EE%F1%F2%EE%E5%E2%F1%EA%E8%E9|work=Klassika.ru}}</ref> The family traced its roots back to a [[Tatar peoples|Tatar]], Aslan Chelebi-[[Morza|Murza]], who in 1389 defected from the [[Golden Horde]] and joined the forces of [[Dmitry Donskoy]], the first prince of [[Muscovy]] to openly challenge the Mongol authority in the region,<ref>Robert Geraci, \"Islam\" in Deborah A.

From there he was assigned to a Moscow hospital, where he served as military doctor, and in 1818, he was appointed a senior physician. In 1819 he married Maria Nechayeva. The following year, he took up a post at the Mariinsky Hospital for the poor. In 1828, when his two sons, [[Mikhail Dostoevsky|Mikhail]] and Fyodor, were eight and seven respectively, he was promoted to collegiate assessor, a position which raised his legal status to that of the nobility and enabled him to acquire a small estate in Darovoye, a town about 150&nbsp;km (100 miles) from Moscow, where the family usually spent the summers.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=11}} Dostoevsky's parents subsequently had six more children: Varvara (1822\u20131892), Andrei (1825\u20131897), Lyubov (born and died 1829), Vera (1829\u20131896), Nikolai (1831\u20131883) and Aleksandra (1835\u20131889).<ref>{{cite book|last=Terras|first=Victor|title=Handbook of Russian Literature|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=VjKh2gkCudAC|page=102}}|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|page=102|isbn=978-0-300-04868-1}}</ref>{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=1\u20135}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=6\u201322}}\n<!--Both of his parents may have had Tatar ancestry as well.{{sfn|Lavrin|1947|p=7}}{{sfn|Hingley|1978|p=17}}-->\n\n== Childhood (1821\u20131835) ==\nFyodor Dostoevsky, born on {{OldStyleDate|11 November|1821|30 October}}, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky and Maria Dostoevskaya (born Nechayeva).

From the age of three, he was read heroic sagas, fairy tales and legends by his nanny, Alena Frolovna, an especially influential figure in his upbringing and love for fictional stories.{{sfn|Leatherbarrow|2002|p=23}} When he was four his mother used the Bible to teach him to read and write. His parents introduced him to a wide range of literature, including Russian writers [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzin]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] and [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]]; [[Gothic fiction]] such as [[Ann Radcliffe]]; romantic works by [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; heroic tales by [[Cervantes]] and [[Walter Scott]]; and [[Homer]]'s [[epic poetry|epics]].{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=6\u201311}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=23\u201354}} Although his father's approach to education has been described as strict and harsh,{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|p=4}} Dostoevsky himself reports that his imagination was brought alive by nightly readings by his parents.{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=72}}\n\nSome of his childhood experiences found their way into his writings. When a nine-year-old girl had been raped by a drunk, he was asked to fetch his father to attend to her. The incident haunted him, and the theme of the desire of a mature man for a young girl appears in ''The Devils'', ''The Brothers Karamazov'', ''Crime and Punishment'', and other writings.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=61}} An incident involving a family servant, or [[Serfdom in Russia|serf]], in the estate in Darovoye, is described in \"[[The Peasant Marey]]\": when the young Dostoevsky imagines hearing a wolf in the forest, Marey, who is working nearby, comforts him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruttenburg |first=Nancy |date=4 January 2010 |title=Dostoevsky's Democracy |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=MLKbtdvf2fUC|page=76}} |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=76\u201377}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Dostoevsky had a delicate physical constitution, his parents described him as hot-headed, stubborn and cheeky.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=6}} In 1833, Dostoevsky's father, who was profoundly religious, sent him to a French boarding school and then to the Chermak boarding school. He was described as a pale, introverted dreamer and an over-excitable romantic.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=39}} To pay the school fees, his father borrowed money and extended his private medical practice. Dostoevsky felt out of place among his aristocratic classmates at the Moscow school, and the experience was later reflected in some of his works, notably ''[[The Raw Youth|The Adolescent]]''.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=23\u201354}}\n\n== Youth (1836\u20131843) ==\n[[File:Image dost 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Dostoevsky as a [[Military engineering|military engineer]]]]\n\nOn 27 September 1837 Dostoevsky's mother died of [[tuberculosis]]. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail to St Petersburg to attend the free [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute]], forcing the brothers to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members. Mikhail was refused admission on health grounds and was sent to an academy in [[Tallinn]], Estonia (then known as Reval).{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=17\u201323}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u201390}}\n\nDostoevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics and military engineering and his preference for drawing and architecture. As his friend [[Konstantin Trutovsky]] once said, \"There was no student in the entire institution with less of a military bearing than F.M. Dostoevsky. He moved clumsily and jerkily; his uniform hung awkwardly on him; and his knapsack, shako and rifle all looked like some sort of fetter he had been forced to wear for a time and which lay heavily on him.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=2}} Dostoevsky's character and interests made him an outsider among his 120 classmates: he showed bravery and a strong sense of justice, protected newcomers, aligned himself with teachers, criticised corruption among officers and helped poor farmers. Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected by his classmates. His reclusiveness and interest in religion earned him the nickname \"Monk [[Photius]]\".{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=24\u20137}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u2013111}}\n\nSigns of Dostoevsky's epilepsy may have first appeared on learning of the death of his father on 16 June 1839,{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=59}} although the reports of a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] originated from accounts written by his daughter (later expanded by [[Sigmund Freud]]<ref>Reik, Theodor (1940).

His father's official cause of death was an [[apoplectic]] stroke, but a neighbour, Pavel Khotiaintsev, accused the father's serfs of murder. Had the serfs been found guilty and sent to [[Siberia]], Khotiaintsev would have been in a position to buy the vacated land. The serfs were acquitted in a trial in [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], but Dostoevsky's brother Andrei perpetuated the story.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=109}} After his father's death, Dostoevsky continued his studies, passed his exams and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy. He visited Mikhail in Reval, and frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets. During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=31\u201336}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u2013111}}\n\nOn 12 August 1843 Dostoevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment owned by Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as \"no less good-natured and no less courteous than his brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, became vexed, forgot good manners, and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of self-awareness\".{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=114\u201315}} Dostoevsky's first completed literary work, a translation of [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Eug\u00e9nie Grandet]]'', was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th and 7th volume of the journal ''Repertoire and Pantheon'',{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=104}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Grossman |first=Leonid |year=2011 |script-title=ru:\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 |language=Russian |trans-title=Dostoevsky  |publisher=[[AST (publisher)|AST]] |page=536}}</ref> followed by several other translations.

His friend [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, took the manuscript to the poet [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], who in turn showed it to the renowned and influential literary critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]]. Belinsky described it as Russia's first \"[[social novel]]\".{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=73}} ''Poor Folk'' was released on 15 January 1846 in the ''St Petersburg Collection'' [[almanac]] and became a commercial success.{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=113\u201357}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=42\u201349}}\n\nDostoevsky felt that his military career would endanger his now flourishing literary career, so he wrote a letter asking to resign his post. Shortly thereafter, he wrote his second novel, ''[[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|The Double]]'', which appeared in the journal ''Notes of the Fatherland'' on 30 January 1846, before being published in February. Around the same time, Dostoevsky discovered socialism through the writings of French thinkers [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], [[Cabet]], [[Proudhon]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Through his relationship with Belinsky he expanded his knowledge of the philosophy of socialism. He was attracted to its logic, its sense of justice and its preoccupation with the destitute and the disadvantaged. However, his relationship with Belinsky became increasingly strained as Belinsky's [[atheism]] and dislike of religion clashed with Dostoevsky's Russian Orthodox beliefs. Dostoevsky eventually parted with him and his associates.{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=159\u201382}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nAfter ''The Double'' received negative reviews, Dostoevsky's health declined and he had more frequent seizures, but he continued writing. From 1846 to 1848 he released several short stories in the magazine ''Annals of the Fatherland'', including \"[[Mr. Prokharchin]]\", \"The Landlady\", \"A Weak Heart\", and \"[[White Nights (short story)|White Nights]]\". These stories were unsuccessful, leaving Dostoevsky once more in financial trouble, so he joined the [[Utopian Socialism|utopian socialist]] Betekov circle, a tightly knit community which helped him to survive. When the circle dissolved, Dostoevsky befriended [[Apollon Maykov]] and his brother [[Valerian Maykov|Valerian]]. In 1846, on the recommendation of the poet [[Aleksey Pleshcheyev]],{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=115\u201321}} he joined the [[Petrashevsky Circle]], founded by [[Mikhail Petrashevsky]], who had proposed social reforms in Russia. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] once wrote to [[Alexander Herzen]] that the group was \"the most innocent and harmless company\" and its members were \"systematic opponents of all revolutionary goals and means\".{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=59}} Dostoevsky used the circle's library on Saturdays and Sundays and occasionally participated in their discussions on freedom from censorship and the abolition of [[serfdom]].{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=239\u201346, 259\u2013346}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=58\u201369}}\n\nIn 1849, the first parts of ''[[Netochka Nezvanova (novel)|Netochka Nezvanova]]'', a novel Dostoevsky had been planning since 1846, were published in ''Annals of the Fatherland'', but his banishment ended the project. Dostoevsky never attempted to complete it.{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\n=== Siberian exile (1849\u20131854) ===\n[[File:B pokrovsky kazn 1849.jpg|thumb|A sketch of the Petrashevsky Circle mock execution]]\n\nThe members of the Petrashevsky Circle were denounced to [[Ivan Petrovich Liprandi|Liprandi]], an official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Dostoevsky was accused of reading works by Belinsky, including the banned ''Letter to Gogol'',<ref name=Belinsky>Belinsky, Vissarion (1847).

Retrieved 27 December 2017.</ref> and of circulating copies of these and other works. Antonelli, the government agent who had reported the group, wrote in his statement that at least one of the papers criticised Russian politics and religion. Dostoevsky responded to these charges by declaring that he had read the essays only \"as a literary monument, neither more nor less\"; he spoke of \"personality and human egoism\" rather than of politics. Even so, he and his fellow \"conspirators\" were arrested on 23 April 1849 at the request of Count [[Alexey Fyodorovich Orlov|A. Orlov]] and Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas&nbsp;I]], who feared a revolution like the [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825 in Russia and the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Europe. The members were held in the well-defended [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], which housed the most dangerous convicts.{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=121\u201333}}{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=6\u201368}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=72\u201379}}\n\nThe case was discussed for four months by an investigative commission headed by the Tsar, with Adjutant General [[Ivan Nabokov]], senator Prince [[Pavel Gagarin]], Prince [[Vasily Andreyevich Dolgorukov|Vasili Dolgorukov]], General [[Yakov Rostovtsev]] and General Leonty Dubelt, head of the secret police. They sentenced the members of the circle to death by firing squad, and the prisoners were taken to Semyonov Place in St Petersburg on 23 December 1849 where they were split into three-man groups. Dostoevsky was the third in the second row; next to him stood Pleshcheyev and Durov. The execution was stayed when a cart delivered a letter from the Tsar commuting the sentence.\n\nDostoevsky served four years of exile with hard labour at a [[katorga]] prison camp in [[Omsk]], Siberia, followed by a term of compulsory military service. After a fourteen-day sleigh ride, the prisoners reached [[Tobolsk]], a prisoner way station. Despite the circumstances, Dostoevsky consoled the other prisoners, such as the Petrashevist Ivan Yastrzhembsky, who was surprised by Dostoevsky's kindness and eventually abandoned his decision to commit suicide. In Tobolsk, the members received food and clothes from the Decembrist women, as well as several copies of the [[New Testament]] with a ten-ruble banknote inside each copy. Eleven days later, Dostoevsky reached Omsk{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=6\u201368}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=79\u201396}} together with just one other member of the Petrashevsky Circle, the poet [[Sergei Durov]].{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=113}} Dostoevsky described his barracks:\n\n{{quote|In summer, intolerable closeness; in winter, unendurable cold.

He was only permitted to read his New Testament Bible. In addition to his seizures, he had [[haemorrhoid]]s, lost weight and was \"burned by some fever, trembling and feeling too hot or too cold every night\". The smell of the privy pervaded the entire building, and the small bathroom had to suffice for more than 200 people. Dostoevsky was occasionally sent to the military hospital, where he read newspapers and Dickens novels. He was respected by most of the other prisoners, and despised by some because of his [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] statements.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=131}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=96\u2013108}}\n\n=== Release from prison and first marriage (1854\u20131866) ===\nAfter his release on 14 February 1854, Dostoevsky asked Mikhail to help him financially and to send him books by [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Guizot]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].{{sfn|Frank|1988|pp=8\u201320}} ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|The House of the Dead]]'', based on his experience in prison, was published in 1861 in the journal ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]'' (\"Time\") \u2013 it was the first published novel about Russian prisons.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|pp=107\u201321}} Before moving in mid-March to [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]], where he was forced to serve in the Siberian Army Corps of the Seventh Line Battalion, Dostoevsky met geographer [[Pyotr Semyonov]] and ethnographer [[Shokan Walikhanuli]]. Around November 1854, he met Baron Alexander Egorovich Wrangel, an admirer of his books, who had attended the aborted execution. They both rented houses in the Cossack Garden outside Semipalatinsk. Wrangel remarked that Dostoevsky \"looked morose. His sickly, pale face was covered with freckles, and his blond hair was cut short. He was a little over average height and looked at me intensely with his sharp, grey-blue eyes.

During a visit to Belikhov, Dostoevsky met the family of Alexander Ivanovich Isaev and Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva and fell in love with the latter. Alexander Isaev took a new post in [[Novokuznetsk|Kuznetsk]], where he died in August 1855. Maria and her son then moved with Dostoevsky to [[Barnaul]]. In 1856 Dostoevsky sent a letter through Wrangel to General Eduard Totleben, apologising for his activity in several utopian circles. As a result, he obtained the right to publish books and to marry, although he remained under police surveillance for the rest of his life. Maria married Dostoevsky in Semipalatinsk on 7 February 1857, even though she had initially refused his marriage proposal, stating that they were not meant for each other and that his poor financial situation precluded marriage. Their family life was unhappy and she found it difficult to cope with his seizures. Describing their relationship, he wrote: \"Because of her strange, suspicious and fantastic character, we were definitely not happy together, but we could not stop loving each other; and the more unhappy we were, the more attached to each other we became\". They mostly lived apart.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=168}} In 1859 he was released from military service because of deteriorating health and was granted permission to return to European Russia, first to [[Tver]], where he met his brother for the first time in ten years, and then to St Petersburg.{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=175\u2013221}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=115\u201363}}\n\n[[File:Dostoevskij 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dostoevsky in Paris, 1863]]\n\n\"A Little Hero\" (Dostoevsky's only work completed in prison) appeared in a journal, but \"Uncle's Dream\" and \"The Village of Stepanchikovo\" were not published until 1860.

In 1864 his wife Maria and his brother Mikhail died, and Dostoevsky became the lone parent of his stepson Pasha and the sole supporter of his brother's family.

One of Dostoevsky's friends, Milyukov, advised him to hire a secretary. Dostoevsky contacted [[stenography|stenographer]] Pavel Olkhin from Saint Petersburg, who recommended his pupil, the twenty-year-old [[Anna Snitkina|Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina]].

On 14 April 1867, they began a delayed honeymoon in Germany with the money gained from the sale. They stayed in Berlin and visited the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], where he sought inspiration for his writing.

In April 1871, Dostoevsky made a final visit to a gambling hall in Wiesbaden. Anna claimed that he stopped gambling after the birth of their second daughter, but this is a subject of debate.{{efn|Another reason for his abstinence might have been the closure of casinos in Germany in 1872 and 1873 (it was not until the rise of Adolf Hitler that they were reopened){{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=245}} or his entering a synagogue that he confused with a gambling hall.

During the trip, he burnt several manuscripts, including those of ''The Idiot'', because he was concerned about potential problems with customs. The family arrived in Saint Petersburg on 8 July, marking the end of a honeymoon (originally planned for three months) that had lasted over four years.{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=241\u2013363}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=265}}\n\n=== Back in Russia (1871\u20131875) ===\n[[File:Dostoyevsky in prison.jpg|thumb|right|Dostoevsky (left) in the Haymarket, 21/22 March 1874]]\n\nBack in Russia in July 1871, the family was again in financial trouble and had to sell their remaining possessions. Their son Fyodor was born on 16 July, and they moved to an apartment near the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|Institute of Technology]] soon after. They hoped to cancel their large debts by selling their rental house in Peski, but difficulties with the tenant resulted in a relatively low selling price, and disputes with their creditors continued.

Around early 1872 the family spent several months in [[Staraya Russa]], a town known for its [[mineral spa]].

''Demons'' was finished on 26 November and released in January 1873 by the \"Dostoevsky Publishing Company\", which was founded by Dostoevsky and his wife. Although they only accepted cash payments and the bookshop was in their own apartment, the business was successful, and they sold around 3,000 copies of ''Demons''. Anna managed the finances. Dostoevsky proposed that they establish a new periodical, which would be called ''A Writer's Diary'' and would include a collection of essays, but funds were lacking, and the ''Diary'' was published in [[Vladimir Meshchersky]]'s ''The Citizen'', beginning on 1 January, in return for a salary of 3,000 rubles per year. In the summer of 1873, Anna returned to Staraya Russa with the children, while Dostoevsky stayed in St Petersburg to continue with his ''Diary''.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=38\u2013118}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=269\u201389}}\n\nIn March 1874, Dostoevsky left ''The Citizen'' because of the stressful work and interference from the Russian bureaucracy. In his fifteen months with ''The Citizen'', he had been taken to court twice: on 11 June 1873 for citing the words of Prince Meshchersky without permission, and again on 23 March 1874. Dostoevsky offered to sell a new novel he had not yet begun to write to ''The Russian Messenger'', but the magazine refused. Nikolay Nekrasov suggested that he publish ''A Writer's Diary'' in ''Notes of the Fatherland''; he would receive 250 rubles for each printer's sheet&nbsp;\u2013 100 more than the text's publication in ''The Russian Messenger'' would have earned. Dostoevsky accepted. As his health began to decline, he consulted several doctors in St Petersburg and was advised to take a cure outside Russia. Around July, he reached Ems and consulted a physician, who diagnosed him with acute [[catarrh]]. During his stay he began ''The Adolescent''. He returned to Saint Petersburg in late July.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=120\u201347}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=273\u201395}}\n\nAnna proposed that they spend the winter in Staraya Russa to allow Dostoevsky to rest, although doctors had suggested a second visit to Ems because his health had previously improved there. On 10 August 1875 his son Alexey was born in Staraya Russa, and in mid-September the family returned to Saint Petersburg. Dostoevsky finished ''The Adolescent'' at the end of 1875, although passages of it had been serialised in ''Notes of the Fatherland'' since January. ''The Adolescent'' chronicles the life of Arkady Dolgoruky, the illegitimate child of the landowner Versilov and a peasant mother. It deals primarily with the relationship between father and son, which became a frequent theme in Dostoevsky's subsequent works.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=149\u201397}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=273\u2013302}}\n\n=== Last years (1876\u20131881) ===\nIn early 1876, Dostoevsky continued work on his ''Diary''. The book includes numerous essays and a few short stories about society, religion, politics and ethics. The collection sold more than twice as many copies as his previous books. Dostoevsky received more letters from readers than ever before, and people of all ages and occupations visited him. With assistance from Anna's brother, the family bought a [[dacha]] in Staraya Russa. In the summer of 1876, Dostoevsky began experiencing shortness of breath again. He visited Ems for the third time and was told that he might live for another 15 years if he moved to a healthier climate. When he returned to Russia, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] ordered Dostoevsky to visit his palace to present the ''Diary'' to him, and he asked him to educate his sons, Sergey and Paul. This visit further increased Dosteyevsky's circle of acquaintances. He was a frequent guest in several salons in Saint Petersburg and met many famous people, including Princess [[Sophia Tolstaya]], [[Yakov Polonsky]], [[Sergei Witte]], [[Alexey Suvorin]], [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Ilya Repin]].{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=199\u2013280}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=303\u201306}}\n\nDostoevsky's health declined further, and in March 1877 he had four epileptic seizures. Rather than returning to Ems, he visited Maly Prikol, a manor near [[Kursk]]. While returning to St Petersburg to finalise his ''Diary'', he visited Darovoye, where he had spent much of his childhood. In December he attended Nekrasov's funeral and gave a speech. He was appointed an honorary member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], from which he received an honorary certificate in February 1879. He declined an invitation to an international congress on copyright in Paris after his son Alyosha had a severe epileptic seizure and died on 16 May. The family later moved to the apartment where Dostoevsky had written his first works. Around this time, he was elected to the board of directors of the Slavic Benevolent Society in Saint Petersburg. That summer, he was elected to the honorary committee of the [[Association Litt\u00e9raire et Artistique Internationale]], whose members included [[Victor Hugo]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Paul Heyse]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Anthony Trollope]], [[Henry Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Dostoevsky made his fourth and final visit to Ems in early August 1879. He was diagnosed with early-stage [[pulmonary emphysema]], which his doctor believed could be successfully managed, but not cured.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=320\u201375}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=307\u201349}}\n\n[[File:Dostoyevsky's funeral.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|Dostoevsky's funeral]]\n\nOn 3 February 1880 Dostoevsky was elected vice-president of the Slavic Benevolent Society, and he was invited to speak at the unveiling of the Pushkin memorial in Moscow. On 8 June he delivered [[Dostoevsky's Pushkin Speech|his speech]], giving an impressive performance that had a significant emotional impact on his audience. His speech was met with thunderous applause, and even his long-time rival Turgenev embraced him. [[Konstantin Staniukovich]] praised the speech in his essay \"The Pushkin Anniversary and Dostoevsky's Speech\" in ''[[:ru:\u0414\u0435\u043b\u043e (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430)|The Business]]'', writing that \"the language of Dostoevsky's [Pushkin Speech] really looks like a sermon.

Although she divorced Dostoevsky's friend [[Stepan Yanovsky]], she would not live with him. Dostoevsky did not love her either, but they were probably good friends. She wrote that he \"became very attracted to me\".{{sfn|Frank|1988|pp=18\u201319}}{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=183\u201384}}\n\nThrough a worker in ''Epoch'', Dostoevsky learned of the Russian-born Martha Brown (n\u00e9e Elizaveta Andreyevna Chlebnikova), who had had affairs with several westerners. Her relationship with Dostoevsky is known only through letters written between November 1864 and January 1865.{{sfn|Frank|2009|pp=445\u201346}}{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=45\u201346}} In 1865, Dostoevsky met [[Anne Jaclard|Anna Korvin-Krukovskaya]]. Their relationship is not verified; Anna Dostoevskaya spoke of a good affair, but Korvin-Krukovskaya's sister, the mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]], thought that Korvin-Krukovskaya had rejected him.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=169}}\n\n=== Political beliefs ===\nIn his youth, Dostoevsky enjoyed reading [[Nikolai Karamzin]]'s ''History of the Russian State'', which praised conservatism and Russian independence, ideas that Dostoevsky would embrace later in life. Before his arrest for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, Dostoevsky remarked, \"As far as I am concerned, nothing was ever more ridiculous than the idea of a [[Republicanism|republican]] government in Russia.\" In an 1881 edition of his ''Diaries'', Dostoevsky <!-- \"favoured republicanism\" Contradictory? --> stated that the Tsar and the people should form a unity: \"For the people, the tsar is not an external power, not the power of some conqueror&nbsp;... but a power of all the people, an all-unifying power the people themselves desired.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183\u201389}}\n\nWhile critical of serfdom, Dostoevsky was skeptical about the creation of a [[constitutional monarchy|constitution]], a concept he viewed as unrelated to Russia's history. He described it as a mere \"gentleman's rule\" and believed that \"a constitution would simply enslave the people\". He advocated social change instead, for example removal of the feudal system and a weakening of the divisions between the peasantry and the affluent classes. His ideal was a [[utopia]]n, Christianized Russia where \"if everyone were actively Christian, not a single social question would come up&nbsp;... If they were Christians they would settle everything\".{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}} He thought democracy and [[oligarchy]] were poor systems; of France he wrote, \"the oligarchs are only concerned with the interest of the wealthy; the democrats, only with the interest of the poor; but the interests of society, the interest of all and the future of France as a whole\u2014no one there bothers about these things.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}} He maintained that political parties ultimately led to social discord. In the 1860s, he discovered ''[[Pochvennichestvo]]'', a movement similar to [[Slavophilism]] in that it [[Anti-Europeanism|rejected Europe's culture]] and contemporary philosophical movements, such as nihilism and materialism. ''Pochvennichestvo'' differed from Slavophilism in aiming to establish, not an isolated Russia, but a more open state modelled on the Russia of [[Peter the Great]].{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}}\n\nIn his incomplete article \"Socialism and Christianity\", Dostoevsky claimed that civilisation (\"the second stage in human history\") had become degraded, and that it was moving towards liberalism and losing its faith in God. He asserted that the traditional concept of Christianity should be recovered. He thought that contemporary western Europe had \"rejected the single formula for their salvation that came from God and was proclaimed through revelation, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself', and replaced it with practical conclusions such as, {{'}}''Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous''{{'}} [Every man for himself and God for all], or \"scientific\" slogans like '[[Survival of the fittest|the struggle for survival]]{{'\"}}.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183\u201389}} He considered this crisis to be the consequence of the collision between communal and individual interests, brought about by a decline in religious and moral principles.\n\nDostoevsky distinguished three \"enormous world ideas\" prevalent in his time: Roman Catholicism, [[Protestantism]] and [[Russian Orthodox]]y. He claimed that Catholicism had continued the tradition of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and had thus become anti-Christian and proto-socialist, inasmuch as the Church's interest in political and mundane affairs led it to abandon the idea of Christ. For Dostoevsky, socialism was \"the latest incarnation of the Catholic idea\" and its \"natural ally\".{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=185}} He found [[Protestantism]] self-contradictory and claimed that it would ultimately lose power and spirituality. He deemed Russian Orthodoxy to be the ideal form of Christianity.\n\nFor all that, to place politically Dostoevsky is not that simple, but: as a Christian, he rejected the atheistic socialism; as a traditionalist, he rejected the destruction of the institutions and, as a pacifist, any violent method or upheaval led by both progressives or reactionaries. He supported private property and business rights, and did not agree with many criticisms of the free market from the socialist utopians of his time.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dostoevsky |first1=Fyodor |title=A Writer's Diary |url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Writer_s_Diary_Volume_1.html?id=38xQHS4h0yEC&redir_esc=y |website=books.google.ca |publisher=Northwestern University Press |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dostoevsky |first1=Fyodor |title=Dostoyevsky's Critique of the West: The Quest for the Earthly Paradise |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bt3fAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&lpg=PT23&dq=a+writer%27s+diary+one+of+the+contemporaneous+falsehoods&source=bl&ots=fjY_imFwcg&sig=ACfU3U2xg620GbU6yrX58ag4ycC4DnuWxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj62s2RxpnjAhUjwFkKHdZ6CSoQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=property&f=false |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]], Dostoevsky asserted that war might be necessary if salvation were to be granted.

Several critics, such as [[Nikolay Dobrolyubov]], [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], viewed his writing as excessively psychological and philosophical rather than artistic. Others found fault with chaotic and disorganised plots, and others, like Turgenev, objected to \"excessive psychologising\" and too-detailed naturalism. His style was deemed \"prolix, repetitious and lacking in polish, balance, restraint and good taste\". [[Saltykov-Shchedrin]], Tolstoy, [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] and others criticised his puppet-like characters, most prominently in ''The Idiot'', ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (''The Possessed'', ''The Devils'')<ref name=\"Demons-Possessed\">The 1872 novel \u2033Demons\u2033, {{lang-ru|link=no|\u0411\u0435\u0441\u044b}}, ''B\u00e9sy'', by Fyodor Dostoevsky is sometimes also titled ''The Possessed'' or ''The Devils''</ref> and ''The Brothers Karamazov''. These characters were compared to those of Hoffmann, an author whom Dostoevsky admired.{{sfn|Terras|1998|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nBasing his estimation on stated criteria of enduring art and individual genius, Nabokov judges Dostoevsky \"not a great writer, but rather a mediocre one\u2014with flashes of excellent humour but, alas, with wastelands of literary platitudes in between\". Nabokov complains that the novels are peopled by \"neurotics and lunatics\" and states that Dostoevsky's characters do not develop: \"We get them all complete at the beginning of the tale and so they remain.\" He finds the novels full of contrived \"surprises and complications of plot\", which are effective when first read, but on second reading, without the shock and benefit of these surprises, appear loaded with \"glorified clich\u00e9\".<ref name=Nabokov>{{cite book|last=Nabokov|first=Vladamir|title=Lectures on Russian Literature|year=1981|publisher=Harvest Book/Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-602776-2|pages=97\u2013135}}</ref> The Scottish poet and critic Edwin Muir, however, addressed this criticism, noting that \"regarding the 'oddness' of Dostoevsky's characters, it has been pointed out that they perhaps only seem 'pathological', whereas in reality they are 'only visualized more clearly than any figures in imaginative literature'.<ref name=Murr>{{cite book|last=Murr|first=Edwin|title=DER 99}}</ref>\n\n=== Reputation ===\nDostoevsky's books have been translated into more than 170 languages.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=foreword}} The German translator Wilhelm Wolfsohn published one of the first translations, parts of ''Poor Folk'', in an 1846\u20131847 magazine,{{sfn|Meier-Gr\u00e4fe|1988|p=492}} and a French translation followed. French, German and Italian translations usually came directly from the original, while English translations were second-hand and of poor quality.{{sfn|Bloshteyn|2007|p=26}} The first English translations were by Marie von Thilo in 1881, but the first highly regarded ones were produced between 1912 and 1920 by [[Constance Garnett]].{{sfn|Jones|Terry|2010|p=216}} Her flowing and easy translations helped popularise Dostoevsky's novels in anglophone countries, and Bakthin's ''Problems of Dostoevsky's Creative Art'' (1929) (republished and revised as ''[[Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics]]'' in 1963) provided further understanding of his style.<ref>{{cite book|last=France|first=Peter|title=The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=pmNoS2dndKsC|page=594}}|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-818359-4|pages=594\u201398}}</ref>\n\nDostoevsky's works were interpreted in film and on stage in many different countries. Princess Varvara Dmitrevna Obolenskaya was among the first to propose staging ''Crime and Punishment''. Dostoevsky did not refuse permission, but he advised against it, as he believed that \"each art corresponds to a series of poetic thoughts, so that one idea cannot be expressed in another non-corresponding form\". His extensive explanations in opposition to the transposition of his works into other media were groundbreaking in fidelity criticism. He thought that just one episode should be dramatised, or an idea should be taken and incorporated into a separate plot.{{sfn|Burry|2011|p=3}} According to critic Alexander Burry, some of the most effective adaptions are [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s opera ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]'s opera ''[[From the House of the Dead]]'', [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Idiot (1951 film)|The Idiot]]'' and [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s film ''[[The Possessed (1988 film)|The Possessed]]''.{{sfn|Burry|2011|p=5}}\n\nIn later years, director [[Janek Ambros]] adapted \"[[The Grand Inquisitor]]\" into Nazi Croatia (the [[Ustasa]] regime) during World War II{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for claim|date=August 2018}} and the television detective character of [[Columbo]] was partially inspired by ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' character Porfiry Petrovich.<ref name=\"latimes1\">{{Cite news |last=Sachs |first=Mark |date=28 January 2003 |title=Dostoevsky, a touch of Columbo |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/28/entertainment/et-tips28 |journal=Los Angeles Times  |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], passages of Dostoevsky books were sometimes shortened, although only two books were censored: ''Demons''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opentextnn.ru/censorship/russia/sov/libraries/books/blium/ilp/?id=344|title=[\u0414-\u0417] |work=Forbidden Books of Russian Writers and Literary Scientists, 1917\u20131991}}</ref> and ''Diary of a Writer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opentextnn.ru/censorship/russia/sov/libraries/books/blium/ilp/kritik/?id=579|title=3.3. \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 \u043e\u0431 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445|work=Forbidden Books of Russian Writers and Literary Scientists, 1917\u20131991}}</ref> His philosophy, particularly in ''Demons'', was deemed anti-capitalist but also anti-Communist and reactionary.{{sfn|Bloshteyn|2007|pp=7\u20138}}<ref>Lenin read Dostoevsky in a more-nuanced way than others, describing ''Demons'' (1871-72) as \"repulsive but great\"; Geoff Waite with Francesca Cernia Slovin, \"Nietzsche with Dostoevsky: Unrequited Collaborators in Crime without Punishment\", in Jeff Love and Jeffrey Metzger, eds., ''Nietzsche and Dostoevsky: Philosophy, Morality, Tragedy'' (Chicago: Northwestern University Press, 2016), {{ISBN|0810133962}}.

Many of his longer novels were first published in [[Serial (literature)|serialised form]] in literary magazines and journals. The years given below indicate the year in which the novel's final part or first complete book edition was published. In English many of his novels and stories are known by different titles.\n\n=== Major works ===\n==== ''Poor Folk'' ====\n{{Main|Poor Folk}}\n\n''Poor Folk'' is an [[epistolary novel]] that describes the relationship between the small, elderly official Makar Devushkin and the young seamstress Varvara Dobroselova, remote relatives who write letters to each other. Makar's tender, sentimental adoration for Varvara and her confident, warm friendship for him explain their evident preference for a simple life, although it keeps them in humiliating poverty. An unscrupulous merchant finds the inexperienced girl and hires her as his housewife and guarantor. He sends her to a manor somewhere on a steppe, while Makar alleviates his misery and pain with alcohol.\n\nThe story focuses on poor people who struggle with their lack of self-esteem. Their misery leads to the loss of their inner freedom, to dependence on the social authorities, and to the extinction of their individuality. Dostoevsky shows how poverty and dependence are indissolubly aligned with deflection and deformation of self-esteem, combining inward and outerward suffering.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=69\u2013103}}\n\n==== ''Notes from Underground'' ====\n{{Main|Notes from Underground}}\n\n''Notes from Underground'' is split into two stylistically different parts, the first essay-like, the second in narrative style. The protagonist and [[first-person narrator]] is an unnamed 40-year-old civil servant known as The Underground Man. The only known facts about his situation are that he has quit the service, lives in a basement flat on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg and finances his livelihood from a modest inheritance.\n\nThe first part is a record of his thoughts about society and his character. He describes himself as vicious, squalid and ugly; the chief focuses of his [[polemic]] are the \"modern human\" and his vision of the world, which he attacks severely and cynically, and towards which he develops aggression and vengefulness. He considers his own decline natural and necessary. Although he emphasises that he does not intend to publish his notes for the public, the narrator appeals repeatedly to an ill-described audience, whose questions he tries to address.\n\nIn the second part he describes scenes from his life that are responsible for his failure in personal and professional life and in his love life. He tells of meeting old school friends, who are in secure positions and treat him with condescension. His aggression turns inward on to himself and he tries to humiliate himself further. He presents himself as a possible saviour to the poor prostitute Lisa, advising her to reject self-reproach when she looks to him for hope. Dostoevsky added a short commentary saying that although the storyline and characters are fictional, such things were inevitable in contemporary society.\n\nThe Underground Man was very influential on philosophers. His alienated existence from the mainstream influenced [[modernist literature]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Halliwell|first=Martin|title=Transatlantic Modernism: Moral Dilemmas in Modernist Fiction|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=RXLT4Gu4aQ4C|page=13}}|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2393-8|page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eysteinsson|first=\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur|title=The Concept of Modernism|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=peKRAu4U458C|page=29}}|year=1990|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8077-5|page=29}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Crime and Punishment'' ====\n{{Main|Crime and Punishment}}\n\n''Crime and Punishment'' describes the fictional [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov|Rodion Raskolnikov]]'s life, from the murder of a pawnbroker and her sister, through spiritual regeneration with the help of Sonya (a \"[[hooker with a heart of gold]]\"), to his sentence in Siberia. Strakhov liked the novel, remarking that \"Only ''Crime and Punishment'' was read in 1866\" and that Dostoevsky had managed to portray a Russian person aptly and realistically.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=183}} Otherwise, it received a mixed reception from critics, with most of the negative responses coming from nihilists. [[Grigory Eliseev]] of the radical magazine ''[[The Contemporary]]'' called the novel a \"fantasy according to which the entire student body is accused without exception of attempting murder and robbery\".{{sfn|Frank|1997|p=45, 60\u2013182}}\n\n==== ''The Idiot'' ====\n{{Main|The Idiot}}\n\nThe novel's protagonist, the 26-year-old [[Prince Myshkin]], returns to Russia after several years at a Swiss sanatorium. Scorned by Saint Petersburg society for his trusting nature and naivety, he finds himself at the center of a struggle between a beautiful kept woman, Nastasya, and a jealous but pretty young girl, Aglaya, both of whom win his affection. Unfortunately, Myshkin's goodness precipitates disaster, leaving the impression that, in a world obsessed with money, power and sexual conquest, a sanatorium may be the only place for a saint. Myshkin is the personification of a \"relatively beautiful man\", namely Christ. Coming \"from above\" (the Swiss mountains), he physically resembles common depictions of [[Jesus Christ]]: slightly larger than average, with thick, blond hair, sunken cheeks and a thin, almost entirely white goatee. Like Christ, Myshkin is a teacher, confessor and mysterious outsider. Passions such as greed and jealousy are alien to him. In contrast to those around him, he puts no value on money and power. He feels compassion and love, sincerely, without judgment. His relationship with the immoral Nastasya is obviously inspired by Christ's relationship with [[Mary Magdalene]]. He is called \"Idiot\" because of such differences.{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=241\u2013363}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=274\u2013309}}\n\n==== ''Demons'' ====\n{{Main|Demons (Dostoevsky novel)}}\n\nThe story of ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (sometimes also titled ''The Possessed'' or ''The Devils'')<ref name=\"Demons-Possessed\" /> is based largely on the murder of Ivan Ivanov by \"People's Vengeance\" members in 1869. It was influenced by the [[Book of Revelation]]. The secondary characters, Pyotr and Stepan Verkhovensky, are based on [[Sergey Nechayev|Sergei Nechayev]] and [[Timofey Granovsky]] respectively.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=310\u201322}} The novel takes place in a provincial Russian setting, primarily on the estates of Stepan Verkhovensky and Varvara Stavrogina. Stepan's son Pyotr is an aspiring revolutionary conspirator who attempts to organise revolutionaries in the area. He considers Varvara's son Nikolai central to his plot, because he thinks that Nikolai lacks sympathy for mankind. Pyotr gathers conspirators such as the philosophising Shigalyov, the suicidal Kirillov and the former military man Virginsky. He schemes to consolidate their loyalty to him and each other by murdering Ivan Shatov, a fellow conspirator. Pyotr plans to have Kirillov, who is committed to killing himself, take credit for the murder in his suicide note. Kirillov complies and Pyotr murders Shatov, but his scheme goes awry. Pyotr escapes, but the remainder of his aspiring revolutionary crew is arrested. In the denouement, Nikolai kills himself, tortured by his own misdeeds.\n\n==== ''The Brothers Karamazov'' ====\n{{Main|The Brothers Karamazov}}\n\nAt nearly 800 pages, ''The Brothers Karamazov'' is Dostoevsky's largest work. It received both critical and popular acclaim and is often cited as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=390\u2013441}} Composed of 12 \"books\", the novel tells the story of the novice [[Alyosha Karamazov]], the non-believer Ivan Karamazov and the soldier Dmitri Karamazov. The first books introduce the Karamazovs. The main plot is the death of their father Fyodor, while other parts are philosophical and religious arguments by Father Zosima to Alyosha.{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=567\u2013705}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=337\u2013414}}\n\nThe most famous chapter is \"[[The Grand Inquisitor]]\", a [[parable]] told by Ivan to Alyosha about Christ's [[Second Coming]] in [[Seville]], Spain, in which Christ is imprisoned by a ninety-year-old Catholic [[Grand Inquisitor]]. Instead of answering him, Christ gives him a kiss, and the Inquisitor subsequently releases him, telling him not to return. The tale was misunderstood as a defence of the Inquisitor, but some, such as [[Romano Guardini]], have argued that the Christ of the parable was Ivan's own interpretation of Christ, \"the idealistic product of the unbelief\". Ivan, however, has stated that he is against Christ. Most contemporary critics and scholars agree that Dostoevsky is attacking Roman Catholicism and socialist atheism, both represented by the Inquisitor.

Dostoevsky's literary works explore [[human psychology]] in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of [[Russian Empire|19th-century Russia]], and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed works include ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), ''[[The Idiot]]'' (1869), [[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|''Demons'']] (1872), and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880). Dostoevsky's body of works consists of 11 novels, three novellas, 17 short stories, and numerous other works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest [[psychologist]]s in [[world literature]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dostoevsky the Thinker: A Philosophical Study|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23116-dostoevsky-the-thinker/|last=Scanlan|first=James Patrick|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8014-3994-0}}</ref> His 1864 novella ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' is considered to be one of the first works of [[existentialism|existentialist]] literature.\n\nBorn in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through [[fairy tales]] and [[legend]]s, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute]]. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'', which gained him entry into [[St. Petersburg]]'s literary circles. Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group that discussed banned books critical of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], he was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later ''[[A Writer's Diary]]'', a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a [[gambling addiction]], which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers.\n\nDostoevsky was influenced by a wide variety of philosophers and authors including [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]], [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Plato]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Vissarion Belinsky|Belinsky]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]], [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]]. His writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians like [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] as well as philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Maria Fyodorovna Dostoyevskaya.jpg\n| width1 = 116\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Maria Fyodorovna Dostoevskaya\n| image2 = Mikhail Andreyevich Dostoyevsky.jpg\n| width2 = 116\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Mikhail Andreyevich Dostoevsky\n| footer = \n}}\n\nDostoevsky's parents were part of a multi-ethnic and multi-denominational noble family, its branches including [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christians, [[Lithuanian nobility]], Polish [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435|url=http://www.klassika.ru/cgi-bin/bio.pl?type=search&string=%C4%EE%F1%F2%EE%E5%E2%F1%EA%E8%E9|work=Klassika.ru}}</ref> The family traced its roots back to a [[Tatar peoples|Tatar]], Aslan Chelebi-[[Morza|Murza]], who in 1389 defected from the [[Golden Horde]] and joined the forces of [[Dmitry Donskoy]], the first prince of [[Muscovy]] to openly challenge the Mongol authority in the region,<ref>Robert Geraci, \"Islam\" in Deborah A.

From there he was assigned to a Moscow hospital, where he served as military doctor, and in 1818, he was appointed a senior physician. In 1819 he married Maria Nechayeva. The following year, he took up a post at the Mariinsky Hospital for the poor. In 1828, when his two sons, [[Mikhail Dostoevsky|Mikhail]] and Fyodor, were eight and seven respectively, he was promoted to collegiate assessor, a position which raised his legal status to that of the nobility and enabled him to acquire a small estate in Darovoye, a town about 150&nbsp;km (100 miles) from Moscow, where the family usually spent the summers.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=11}} Dostoevsky's parents subsequently had six more children: Varvara (1822\u20131892), Andrei (1825\u20131897), Lyubov (born and died 1829), Vera (1829\u20131896), Nikolai (1831\u20131883) and Aleksandra (1835\u20131889).<ref>{{cite book|last=Terras|first=Victor|title=Handbook of Russian Literature|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=VjKh2gkCudAC|page=102}}|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|page=102|isbn=978-0-300-04868-1}}</ref>{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=1\u20135}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=6\u201322}}\n<!--Both of his parents may have had Tatar ancestry as well.{{sfn|Lavrin|1947|p=7}}{{sfn|Hingley|1978|p=17}}-->\n\n== Childhood (1821\u20131835) ==\nFyodor Dostoevsky, born on {{OldStyleDate|11 November|1821|30 October}}, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky and Maria Dostoevskaya (born Nechayeva). He was raised in the family home in the grounds of the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor, which was in a lower class district on the edges of Moscow.{{sfn|Bloom|2004|p=9}} Dostoevsky encountered the patients, who were at the lower end of the Russian social scale, when playing in the hospital gardens.{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=72}}\n\nDostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age. From the age of three, he was read heroic sagas, fairy tales and legends by his nanny, Alena Frolovna, an especially influential figure in his upbringing and love for fictional stories.{{sfn|Leatherbarrow|2002|p=23}} When he was four his mother used the Bible to teach him to read and write. His parents introduced him to a wide range of literature, including Russian writers [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzin]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] and [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]]; [[Gothic fiction]] such as [[Ann Radcliffe]]; romantic works by [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; heroic tales by [[Cervantes]] and [[Walter Scott]]; and [[Homer]]'s [[epic poetry|epics]].{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=6\u201311}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=23\u201354}} Although his father's approach to education has been described as strict and harsh,{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|p=4}} Dostoevsky himself reports that his imagination was brought alive by nightly readings by his parents.{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=72}}\n\nSome of his childhood experiences found their way into his writings. When a nine-year-old girl had been raped by a drunk, he was asked to fetch his father to attend to her. The incident haunted him, and the theme of the desire of a mature man for a young girl appears in ''The Devils'', ''The Brothers Karamazov'', ''Crime and Punishment'', and other writings.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=61}} An incident involving a family servant, or [[Serfdom in Russia|serf]], in the estate in Darovoye, is described in \"[[The Peasant Marey]]\": when the young Dostoevsky imagines hearing a wolf in the forest, Marey, who is working nearby, comforts him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruttenburg |first=Nancy |date=4 January 2010 |title=Dostoevsky's Democracy |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=MLKbtdvf2fUC|page=76}} |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=76\u201377}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Dostoevsky had a delicate physical constitution, his parents described him as hot-headed, stubborn and cheeky.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=6}} In 1833, Dostoevsky's father, who was profoundly religious, sent him to a French boarding school and then to the Chermak boarding school. He was described as a pale, introverted dreamer and an over-excitable romantic.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=39}} To pay the school fees, his father borrowed money and extended his private medical practice. Dostoevsky felt out of place among his aristocratic classmates at the Moscow school, and the experience was later reflected in some of his works, notably ''[[The Raw Youth|The Adolescent]]''.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=23\u201354}}\n\n== Youth (1836\u20131843) ==\n[[File:Image dost 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Dostoevsky as a [[Military engineering|military engineer]]]]\n\nOn 27 September 1837 Dostoevsky's mother died of [[tuberculosis]]. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail to St Petersburg to attend the free [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute]], forcing the brothers to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members. Mikhail was refused admission on health grounds and was sent to an academy in [[Tallinn]], Estonia (then known as Reval).{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=17\u201323}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u201390}}\n\nDostoevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics and military engineering and his preference for drawing and architecture. As his friend [[Konstantin Trutovsky]] once said, \"There was no student in the entire institution with less of a military bearing than F.M. Dostoevsky. He moved clumsily and jerkily; his uniform hung awkwardly on him; and his knapsack, shako and rifle all looked like some sort of fetter he had been forced to wear for a time and which lay heavily on him.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=2}} Dostoevsky's character and interests made him an outsider among his 120 classmates: he showed bravery and a strong sense of justice, protected newcomers, aligned himself with teachers, criticised corruption among officers and helped poor farmers. Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected by his classmates. His reclusiveness and interest in religion earned him the nickname \"Monk [[Photius]]\".{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=24\u20137}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u2013111}}\n\nSigns of Dostoevsky's epilepsy may have first appeared on learning of the death of his father on 16 June 1839,{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=59}} although the reports of a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] originated from accounts written by his daughter (later expanded by [[Sigmund Freud]]<ref>Reik, Theodor (1940).

His father's official cause of death was an [[apoplectic]] stroke, but a neighbour, Pavel Khotiaintsev, accused the father's serfs of murder. Had the serfs been found guilty and sent to [[Siberia]], Khotiaintsev would have been in a position to buy the vacated land. The serfs were acquitted in a trial in [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], but Dostoevsky's brother Andrei perpetuated the story.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=109}} After his father's death, Dostoevsky continued his studies, passed his exams and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy. He visited Mikhail in Reval, and frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets. During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=31\u201336}}{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=69\u2013111}}\n\nOn 12 August 1843 Dostoevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment owned by Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as \"no less good-natured and no less courteous than his brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, became vexed, forgot good manners, and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of self-awareness\".{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=114\u201315}} Dostoevsky's first completed literary work, a translation of [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Eug\u00e9nie Grandet]]'', was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th and 7th volume of the journal ''Repertoire and Pantheon'',{{sfn|Breger|2008|p=104}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Grossman |first=Leonid |year=2011 |script-title=ru:\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 |language=Russian |trans-title=Dostoevsky  |publisher=[[AST (publisher)|AST]] |page=536}}</ref> followed by several other translations.

His friend [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, took the manuscript to the poet [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], who in turn showed it to the renowned and influential literary critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]]. Belinsky described it as Russia's first \"[[social novel]]\".{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=73}} ''Poor Folk'' was released on 15 January 1846 in the ''St Petersburg Collection'' [[almanac]] and became a commercial success.{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=113\u201357}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=42\u201349}}\n\nDostoevsky felt that his military career would endanger his now flourishing literary career, so he wrote a letter asking to resign his post. Shortly thereafter, he wrote his second novel, ''[[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|The Double]]'', which appeared in the journal ''Notes of the Fatherland'' on 30 January 1846, before being published in February. Around the same time, Dostoevsky discovered socialism through the writings of French thinkers [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], [[Cabet]], [[Proudhon]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Through his relationship with Belinsky he expanded his knowledge of the philosophy of socialism. He was attracted to its logic, its sense of justice and its preoccupation with the destitute and the disadvantaged. However, his relationship with Belinsky became increasingly strained as Belinsky's [[atheism]] and dislike of religion clashed with Dostoevsky's Russian Orthodox beliefs. Dostoevsky eventually parted with him and his associates.{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=159\u201382}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nAfter ''The Double'' received negative reviews, Dostoevsky's health declined and he had more frequent seizures, but he continued writing. From 1846 to 1848 he released several short stories in the magazine ''Annals of the Fatherland'', including \"[[Mr. Prokharchin]]\", \"The Landlady\", \"A Weak Heart\", and \"[[White Nights (short story)|White Nights]]\". These stories were unsuccessful, leaving Dostoevsky once more in financial trouble, so he joined the [[Utopian Socialism|utopian socialist]] Betekov circle, a tightly knit community which helped him to survive. When the circle dissolved, Dostoevsky befriended [[Apollon Maykov]] and his brother [[Valerian Maykov|Valerian]]. In 1846, on the recommendation of the poet [[Aleksey Pleshcheyev]],{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=115\u201321}} he joined the [[Petrashevsky Circle]], founded by [[Mikhail Petrashevsky]], who had proposed social reforms in Russia. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] once wrote to [[Alexander Herzen]] that the group was \"the most innocent and harmless company\" and its members were \"systematic opponents of all revolutionary goals and means\".{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=59}} Dostoevsky used the circle's library on Saturdays and Sundays and occasionally participated in their discussions on freedom from censorship and the abolition of [[serfdom]].{{sfn|Frank|1979|pp=239\u201346, 259\u2013346}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=58\u201369}}\n\nIn 1849, the first parts of ''[[Netochka Nezvanova (novel)|Netochka Nezvanova]]'', a novel Dostoevsky had been planning since 1846, were published in ''Annals of the Fatherland'', but his banishment ended the project.

Dostoevsky was accused of reading works by Belinsky, including the banned ''Letter to Gogol'',<ref name=Belinsky>Belinsky, Vissarion (1847).

Antonelli, the government agent who had reported the group, wrote in his statement that at least one of the papers criticised Russian politics and religion. Dostoevsky responded to these charges by declaring that he had read the essays only \"as a literary monument, neither more nor less\"; he spoke of \"personality and human egoism\" rather than of politics. Even so, he and his fellow \"conspirators\" were arrested on 23 April 1849 at the request of Count [[Alexey Fyodorovich Orlov|A. Orlov]] and Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas&nbsp;I]], who feared a revolution like the [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825 in Russia and the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Europe. The members were held in the well-defended [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], which housed the most dangerous convicts.{{sfn|Mochulsky|1967|pp=121\u201333}}{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=6\u201368}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=72\u201379}}\n\nThe case was discussed for four months by an investigative commission headed by the Tsar, with Adjutant General [[Ivan Nabokov]], senator Prince [[Pavel Gagarin]], Prince [[Vasily Andreyevich Dolgorukov|Vasili Dolgorukov]], General [[Yakov Rostovtsev]] and General Leonty Dubelt, head of the secret police. They sentenced the members of the circle to death by firing squad, and the prisoners were taken to Semyonov Place in St Petersburg on 23 December 1849 where they were split into three-man groups. Dostoevsky was the third in the second row; next to him stood Pleshcheyev and Durov. The execution was stayed when a cart delivered a letter from the Tsar commuting the sentence.\n\nDostoevsky served four years of exile with hard labour at a [[katorga]] prison camp in [[Omsk]], Siberia, followed by a term of compulsory military service. After a fourteen-day sleigh ride, the prisoners reached [[Tobolsk]], a prisoner way station. Despite the circumstances, Dostoevsky consoled the other prisoners, such as the Petrashevist Ivan Yastrzhembsky, who was surprised by Dostoevsky's kindness and eventually abandoned his decision to commit suicide. In Tobolsk, the members received food and clothes from the Decembrist women, as well as several copies of the [[New Testament]] with a ten-ruble banknote inside each copy. Eleven days later, Dostoevsky reached Omsk{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=6\u201368}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=79\u201396}} together with just one other member of the Petrashevsky Circle, the poet [[Sergei Durov]].{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=113}} Dostoevsky described his barracks:\n\n{{quote|In summer, intolerable closeness; in winter, unendurable cold.

He was only permitted to read his New Testament Bible. In addition to his seizures, he had [[haemorrhoid]]s, lost weight and was \"burned by some fever, trembling and feeling too hot or too cold every night\". The smell of the privy pervaded the entire building, and the small bathroom had to suffice for more than 200 people. Dostoevsky was occasionally sent to the military hospital, where he read newspapers and Dickens novels. He was respected by most of the other prisoners, and despised by some because of his [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] statements.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=131}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=96\u2013108}}\n\n=== Release from prison and first marriage (1854\u20131866) ===\nAfter his release on 14 February 1854, Dostoevsky asked Mikhail to help him financially and to send him books by [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Guizot]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].{{sfn|Frank|1988|pp=8\u201320}} ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|The House of the Dead]]'', based on his experience in prison, was published in 1861 in the journal ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]'' (\"Time\") \u2013 it was the first published novel about Russian prisons.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|pp=107\u201321}} Before moving in mid-March to [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]], where he was forced to serve in the Siberian Army Corps of the Seventh Line Battalion, Dostoevsky met geographer [[Pyotr Semyonov]] and ethnographer [[Shokan Walikhanuli]]. Around November 1854, he met Baron Alexander Egorovich Wrangel, an admirer of his books, who had attended the aborted execution. They both rented houses in the Cossack Garden outside Semipalatinsk. Wrangel remarked that Dostoevsky \"looked morose. His sickly, pale face was covered with freckles, and his blond hair was cut short. He was a little over average height and looked at me intensely with his sharp, grey-blue eyes. It was as if he were trying to look into my soul and discover what kind of man I was.\"{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=112\u201313}}{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=165\u2013267}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=108\u201313}}\n\nIn Semipalatinsk, Dostoevsky tutored several schoolchildren and came into contact with upper-class families, including that of Lieutenant-Colonel Belikhov, who used to invite him to read passages from newspapers and magazines. During a visit to Belikhov, Dostoevsky met the family of Alexander Ivanovich Isaev and Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva and fell in love with the latter. Alexander Isaev took a new post in [[Novokuznetsk|Kuznetsk]], where he died in August 1855. Maria and her son then moved with Dostoevsky to [[Barnaul]]. In 1856 Dostoevsky sent a letter through Wrangel to General Eduard Totleben, apologising for his activity in several utopian circles. As a result, he obtained the right to publish books and to marry, although he remained under police surveillance for the rest of his life. Maria married Dostoevsky in Semipalatinsk on 7 February 1857, even though she had initially refused his marriage proposal, stating that they were not meant for each other and that his poor financial situation precluded marriage. Their family life was unhappy and she found it difficult to cope with his seizures. Describing their relationship, he wrote: \"Because of her strange, suspicious and fantastic character, we were definitely not happy together, but we could not stop loving each other; and the more unhappy we were, the more attached to each other we became\". They mostly lived apart.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=168}} In 1859 he was released from military service because of deteriorating health and was granted permission to return to European Russia, first to [[Tver]], where he met his brother for the first time in ten years, and then to St Petersburg.{{sfn|Frank|1987|pp=175\u2013221}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=115\u201363}}\n\n[[File:Dostoevskij 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dostoevsky in Paris, 1863]]\n\n\"A Little Hero\" (Dostoevsky's only work completed in prison) appeared in a journal, but \"Uncle's Dream\" and \"The Village of Stepanchikovo\" were not published until 1860.

In London, he met [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]] and visited the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]]. He travelled with [[Nikolay Strakhov]] through Switzerland and several North Italian cities, including Turin, Livorno, and Florence.

He met his second love, [[Apollinaria Suslova|Polina Suslova]], in Paris and lost nearly all his money gambling in Wiesbaden and Baden-Baden. In 1864 his wife Maria and his brother Mikhail died, and Dostoevsky became the lone parent of his stepson Pasha and the sole supporter of his brother's family. The failure of ''[[Epoch (Russian magazine)|Epoch]]'', the magazine he had founded with Mikhail after the suppression of ''Vremya'', worsened his financial situation, although the continued help of his relatives and friends averted bankruptcy.{{sfn|Frank|1988|pp=197\u2013211, 283\u201394, 248\u2013365}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=151\u201375}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Second marriage and honeymoon (1866\u20131871) ===\nThe first two parts of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' were published in January and February 1866 in the periodical ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'',{{sfn|Frank|2009|p=462}} attracting at least 500 new subscribers to the magazine.{{sfn|Leatherbarrow|2002|p=83}}\n\nDostoevsky returned to Saint Petersburg in mid-September and promised his editor, [[Fyodor Stellovsky]], that he would complete ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]'', a short novel focused on [[problem gambling|gambling addiction]], by November, although he had not yet begun writing it. One of Dostoevsky's friends, Milyukov, advised him to hire a secretary. Dostoevsky contacted [[stenography|stenographer]] Pavel Olkhin from Saint Petersburg, who recommended his pupil, the twenty-year-old [[Anna Snitkina|Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina]].

The 7,000 rubles he had earned from ''Crime and Punishment'' did not cover their debts, forcing Anna to sell her valuables. On 14 April 1867, they began a delayed honeymoon in Germany with the money gained from the sale. They stayed in Berlin and visited the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], where he sought inspiration for his writing. They continued their trip through Germany, visiting [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Heidelberg]] and [[Karlsruhe]].

In April 1871, Dostoevsky made a final visit to a gambling hall in Wiesbaden. Anna claimed that he stopped gambling after the birth of their second daughter, but this is a subject of debate.{{efn|Another reason for his abstinence might have been the closure of casinos in Germany in 1872 and 1873 (it was not until the rise of Adolf Hitler that they were reopened){{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=245}} or his entering a synagogue that he confused with a gambling hall.

Their son Fyodor was born on 16 July, and they moved to an apartment near the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|Institute of Technology]] soon after. They hoped to cancel their large debts by selling their rental house in Peski, but difficulties with the tenant resulted in a relatively low selling price, and disputes with their creditors continued.

Around early 1872 the family spent several months in [[Staraya Russa]], a town known for its [[mineral spa]].

''Demons'' was finished on 26 November and released in January 1873 by the \"Dostoevsky Publishing Company\", which was founded by Dostoevsky and his wife. Although they only accepted cash payments and the bookshop was in their own apartment, the business was successful, and they sold around 3,000 copies of ''Demons''. Anna managed the finances. Dostoevsky proposed that they establish a new periodical, which would be called ''A Writer's Diary'' and would include a collection of essays, but funds were lacking, and the ''Diary'' was published in [[Vladimir Meshchersky]]'s ''The Citizen'', beginning on 1 January, in return for a salary of 3,000 rubles per year. In the summer of 1873, Anna returned to Staraya Russa with the children, while Dostoevsky stayed in St Petersburg to continue with his ''Diary''.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=38\u2013118}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=269\u201389}}\n\nIn March 1874, Dostoevsky left ''The Citizen'' because of the stressful work and interference from the Russian bureaucracy. In his fifteen months with ''The Citizen'', he had been taken to court twice: on 11 June 1873 for citing the words of Prince Meshchersky without permission, and again on 23 March 1874. Dostoevsky offered to sell a new novel he had not yet begun to write to ''The Russian Messenger'', but the magazine refused. Nikolay Nekrasov suggested that he publish ''A Writer's Diary'' in ''Notes of the Fatherland''; he would receive 250 rubles for each printer's sheet&nbsp;\u2013 100 more than the text's publication in ''The Russian Messenger'' would have earned. Dostoevsky accepted. As his health began to decline, he consulted several doctors in St Petersburg and was advised to take a cure outside Russia. Around July, he reached Ems and consulted a physician, who diagnosed him with acute [[catarrh]]. During his stay he began ''The Adolescent''. He returned to Saint Petersburg in late July.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=120\u201347}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=273\u201395}}\n\nAnna proposed that they spend the winter in Staraya Russa to allow Dostoevsky to rest, although doctors had suggested a second visit to Ems because his health had previously improved there. On 10 August 1875 his son Alexey was born in Staraya Russa, and in mid-September the family returned to Saint Petersburg. Dostoevsky finished ''The Adolescent'' at the end of 1875, although passages of it had been serialised in ''Notes of the Fatherland'' since January. ''The Adolescent'' chronicles the life of Arkady Dolgoruky, the illegitimate child of the landowner Versilov and a peasant mother. It deals primarily with the relationship between father and son, which became a frequent theme in Dostoevsky's subsequent works.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=149\u201397}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=273\u2013302}}\n\n=== Last years (1876\u20131881) ===\nIn early 1876, Dostoevsky continued work on his ''Diary''. The book includes numerous essays and a few short stories about society, religion, politics and ethics. The collection sold more than twice as many copies as his previous books. Dostoevsky received more letters from readers than ever before, and people of all ages and occupations visited him. With assistance from Anna's brother, the family bought a [[dacha]] in Staraya Russa. In the summer of 1876, Dostoevsky began experiencing shortness of breath again. He visited Ems for the third time and was told that he might live for another 15 years if he moved to a healthier climate. When he returned to Russia, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] ordered Dostoevsky to visit his palace to present the ''Diary'' to him, and he asked him to educate his sons, Sergey and Paul. This visit further increased Dosteyevsky's circle of acquaintances. He was a frequent guest in several salons in Saint Petersburg and met many famous people, including Princess [[Sophia Tolstaya]], [[Yakov Polonsky]], [[Sergei Witte]], [[Alexey Suvorin]], [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Ilya Repin]].{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=199\u2013280}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=303\u201306}}\n\nDostoevsky's health declined further, and in March 1877 he had four epileptic seizures. Rather than returning to Ems, he visited Maly Prikol, a manor near [[Kursk]]. While returning to St Petersburg to finalise his ''Diary'', he visited Darovoye, where he had spent much of his childhood. In December he attended Nekrasov's funeral and gave a speech. He was appointed an honorary member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], from which he received an honorary certificate in February 1879. He declined an invitation to an international congress on copyright in Paris after his son Alyosha had a severe epileptic seizure and died on 16 May. The family later moved to the apartment where Dostoevsky had written his first works. Around this time, he was elected to the board of directors of the Slavic Benevolent Society in Saint Petersburg. That summer, he was elected to the honorary committee of the [[Association Litt\u00e9raire et Artistique Internationale]], whose members included [[Victor Hugo]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Paul Heyse]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Anthony Trollope]], [[Henry Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Dostoevsky made his fourth and final visit to Ems in early August 1879. He was diagnosed with early-stage [[pulmonary emphysema]], which his doctor believed could be successfully managed, but not cured.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=320\u201375}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=307\u201349}}\n\n[[File:Dostoyevsky's funeral.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|Dostoevsky's funeral]]\n\nOn 3 February 1880 Dostoevsky was elected vice-president of the Slavic Benevolent Society, and he was invited to speak at the unveiling of the Pushkin memorial in Moscow. On 8 June he delivered [[Dostoevsky's Pushkin Speech|his speech]], giving an impressive performance that had a significant emotional impact on his audience. His speech was met with thunderous applause, and even his long-time rival Turgenev embraced him.

Suslova's dalliance with a Spaniard in late spring and Dostoevsky's gambling addiction and age ended their relationship. He later described her in a letter to Nadezhda Suslova as a \"great egoist. Her egoism and her vanity are colossal. She demands ''everything'' of other people, all the perfections, and does not pardon the slightest imperfection in the light of other qualities that one may possess\", and later stated \"I still love her, but I do not want to love her any more. She doesn't deserve this love&nbsp;...\"{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=168}} In 1858 Dostoevsky had a romance with comic actress Aleksandra Ivanovna Schubert.

Her relationship with Dostoevsky is known only through letters written between November 1864 and January 1865.{{sfn|Frank|2009|pp=445\u201346}}{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=45\u201346}} In 1865, Dostoevsky met [[Anne Jaclard|Anna Korvin-Krukovskaya]]. Their relationship is not verified; Anna Dostoevskaya spoke of a good affair, but Korvin-Krukovskaya's sister, the mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]], thought that Korvin-Krukovskaya had rejected him.{{sfn|Sekirin|1997|p=169}}\n\n=== Political beliefs ===\nIn his youth, Dostoevsky enjoyed reading [[Nikolai Karamzin]]'s ''History of the Russian State'', which praised conservatism and Russian independence, ideas that Dostoevsky would embrace later in life. Before his arrest for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, Dostoevsky remarked, \"As far as I am concerned, nothing was ever more ridiculous than the idea of a [[Republicanism|republican]] government in Russia.\" In an 1881 edition of his ''Diaries'', Dostoevsky <!-- \"favoured republicanism\" Contradictory? --> stated that the Tsar and the people should form a unity: \"For the people, the tsar is not an external power, not the power of some conqueror&nbsp;... but a power of all the people, an all-unifying power the people themselves desired.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183\u201389}}\n\nWhile critical of serfdom, Dostoevsky was skeptical about the creation of a [[constitutional monarchy|constitution]], a concept he viewed as unrelated to Russia's history. He described it as a mere \"gentleman's rule\" and believed that \"a constitution would simply enslave the people\". He advocated social change instead, for example removal of the feudal system and a weakening of the divisions between the peasantry and the affluent classes. His ideal was a [[utopia]]n, Christianized Russia where \"if everyone were actively Christian, not a single social question would come up&nbsp;... If they were Christians they would settle everything\".{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}} He thought democracy and [[oligarchy]] were poor systems; of France he wrote, \"the oligarchs are only concerned with the interest of the wealthy; the democrats, only with the interest of the poor; but the interests of society, the interest of all and the future of France as a whole\u2014no one there bothers about these things.\"{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}} He maintained that political parties ultimately led to social discord. In the 1860s, he discovered ''[[Pochvennichestvo]]'', a movement similar to [[Slavophilism]] in that it [[Anti-Europeanism|rejected Europe's culture]] and contemporary philosophical movements, such as nihilism and materialism. ''Pochvennichestvo'' differed from Slavophilism in aiming to establish, not an isolated Russia, but a more open state modelled on the Russia of [[Peter the Great]].{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=323\u201327}}\n\nIn his incomplete article \"Socialism and Christianity\", Dostoevsky claimed that civilisation (\"the second stage in human history\") had become degraded, and that it was moving towards liberalism and losing its faith in God. He asserted that the traditional concept of Christianity should be recovered. He thought that contemporary western Europe had \"rejected the single formula for their salvation that came from God and was proclaimed through revelation, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself', and replaced it with practical conclusions such as, {{'}}''Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous''{{'}} [Every man for himself and God for all], or \"scientific\" slogans like '[[Survival of the fittest|the struggle for survival]]{{'\"}}.{{sfn|Lantz|2004|pp=183\u201389}} He considered this crisis to be the consequence of the collision between communal and individual interests, brought about by a decline in religious and moral principles.\n\nDostoevsky distinguished three \"enormous world ideas\" prevalent in his time: Roman Catholicism, [[Protestantism]] and [[Russian Orthodox]]y. He claimed that Catholicism had continued the tradition of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and had thus become anti-Christian and proto-socialist, inasmuch as the Church's interest in political and mundane affairs led it to abandon the idea of Christ. For Dostoevsky, socialism was \"the latest incarnation of the Catholic idea\" and its \"natural ally\".{{sfn|Lantz|2004|p=185}} He found [[Protestantism]] self-contradictory and claimed that it would ultimately lose power and spirituality. He deemed Russian Orthodoxy to be the ideal form of Christianity.\n\nFor all that, to place politically Dostoevsky is not that simple, but: as a Christian, he rejected the atheistic socialism; as a traditionalist, he rejected the destruction of the institutions and, as a pacifist, any violent method or upheaval led by both progressives or reactionaries. He supported private property and business rights, and did not agree with many criticisms of the free market from the socialist utopians of his time.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dostoevsky |first1=Fyodor |title=A Writer's Diary |url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Writer_s_Diary_Volume_1.html?id=38xQHS4h0yEC&redir_esc=y |website=books.google.ca |publisher=Northwestern University Press |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dostoevsky |first1=Fyodor |title=Dostoyevsky's Critique of the West: The Quest for the Earthly Paradise |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bt3fAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&lpg=PT23&dq=a+writer%27s+diary+one+of+the+contemporaneous+falsehoods&source=bl&ots=fjY_imFwcg&sig=ACfU3U2xg620GbU6yrX58ag4ycC4DnuWxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj62s2RxpnjAhUjwFkKHdZ6CSoQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=property&f=false |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]], Dostoevsky asserted that war might be necessary if salvation were to be granted.

Several critics, such as [[Nikolay Dobrolyubov]], [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], viewed his writing as excessively psychological and philosophical rather than artistic. Others found fault with chaotic and disorganised plots, and others, like Turgenev, objected to \"excessive psychologising\" and too-detailed naturalism. His style was deemed \"prolix, repetitious and lacking in polish, balance, restraint and good taste\". [[Saltykov-Shchedrin]], Tolstoy, [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] and others criticised his puppet-like characters, most prominently in ''The Idiot'', ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (''The Possessed'', ''The Devils'')<ref name=\"Demons-Possessed\">The 1872 novel \u2033Demons\u2033, {{lang-ru|link=no|\u0411\u0435\u0441\u044b}}, ''B\u00e9sy'', by Fyodor Dostoevsky is sometimes also titled ''The Possessed'' or ''The Devils''</ref> and ''The Brothers Karamazov''. These characters were compared to those of Hoffmann, an author whom Dostoevsky admired.{{sfn|Terras|1998|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nBasing his estimation on stated criteria of enduring art and individual genius, Nabokov judges Dostoevsky \"not a great writer, but rather a mediocre one\u2014with flashes of excellent humour but, alas, with wastelands of literary platitudes in between\". Nabokov complains that the novels are peopled by \"neurotics and lunatics\" and states that Dostoevsky's characters do not develop: \"We get them all complete at the beginning of the tale and so they remain.\" He finds the novels full of contrived \"surprises and complications of plot\", which are effective when first read, but on second reading, without the shock and benefit of these surprises, appear loaded with \"glorified clich\u00e9\".<ref name=Nabokov>{{cite book|last=Nabokov|first=Vladamir|title=Lectures on Russian Literature|year=1981|publisher=Harvest Book/Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-602776-2|pages=97\u2013135}}</ref> The Scottish poet and critic Edwin Muir, however, addressed this criticism, noting that \"regarding the 'oddness' of Dostoevsky's characters, it has been pointed out that they perhaps only seem 'pathological', whereas in reality they are 'only visualized more clearly than any figures in imaginative literature'.<ref name=Murr>{{cite book|last=Murr|first=Edwin|title=DER 99</ref>\n\n=== Reputation ===\nDostoevsky's books have been translated into more than 170 languages.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=foreword}} The German translator Wilhelm Wolfsohn published one of the first translations, parts of ''Poor Folk'', in an 1846\u20131847 magazine,{{sfn|Meier-Gr\u00e4fe|1988|p=492}} and a French translation followed. French, German and Italian translations usually came directly from the original, while English translations were second-hand and of poor quality.{{sfn|Bloshteyn|2007|p=26}} The first English translations were by Marie von Thilo in 1881, but the first highly regarded ones were produced between 1912 and 1920 by [[Constance Garnett]].{{sfn|Jones|Terry|2010|p=216}} Her flowing and easy translations helped popularise Dostoevsky's novels in anglophone countries, and Bakthin's ''Problems of Dostoevsky's Creative Art'' (1929) (republished and revised as ''[[Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics]]'' in 1963) provided further understanding of his style.<ref>{{cite book|last=France|first=Peter|title=The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=pmNoS2dndKsC|page=594}}|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-818359-4|pages=594\u201398}}</ref>\n\nDostoevsky's works were interpreted in film and on stage in many different countries. Princess Varvara Dmitrevna Obolenskaya was among the first to propose staging ''Crime and Punishment''. Dostoevsky did not refuse permission, but he advised against it, as he believed that \"each art corresponds to a series of poetic thoughts, so that one idea cannot be expressed in another non-corresponding form\". His extensive explanations in opposition to the transposition of his works into other media were groundbreaking in fidelity criticism. He thought that just one episode should be dramatised, or an idea should be taken and incorporated into a separate plot.{{sfn|Burry|2011|p=3}} According to critic Alexander Burry, some of the most effective adaptions are [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s opera ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]'s opera ''[[From the House of the Dead]]'', [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Idiot (1951 film)|The Idiot]]'' and [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s film ''[[The Possessed (1988 film)|The Possessed]]''.{{sfn|Burry|2011|p=5}}\n\nIn later years, director [[Janek Ambros]] adapted \"[[The Grand Inquisitor]]\" into Nazi Croatia (the [[Ustasa]] regime) during World War II{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for claim|date=August 2018}} and the television detective character of [[Columbo]] was partially inspired by ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' character Porfiry Petrovich.<ref name=\"latimes1\">{{Cite news |last=Sachs |first=Mark |date=28 January 2003 |title=Dostoevsky, a touch of Columbo |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/28/entertainment/et-tips28 |journal=Los Angeles Times  |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], passages of Dostoevsky books were sometimes shortened, although only two books were censored: ''Demons''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opentextnn.ru/censorship/russia/sov/libraries/books/blium/ilp/?id=344|title=[\u0414-\u0417] |work=Forbidden Books of Russian Writers and Literary Scientists, 1917\u20131991}}</ref> and ''Diary of a Writer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opentextnn.ru/censorship/russia/sov/libraries/books/blium/ilp/kritik/?id=579|title=3.3. \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 \u043e\u0431 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445|work=Forbidden Books of Russian Writers and Literary Scientists, 1917\u20131991}}</ref> His philosophy, particularly in ''Demons'', was deemed anti-capitalist but also anti-Communist and reactionary.{{sfn|Bloshteyn|2007|pp=7\u20138}}<ref>Lenin read Dostoevsky in a more-nuanced way than others, describing ''Demons'' (1871-72) as \"repulsive but great\"; Geoff Waite with Francesca Cernia Slovin, \"Nietzsche with Dostoevsky: Unrequited Collaborators in Crime without Punishment\", in Jeff Love and Jeffrey Metzger, eds., ''Nietzsche and Dostoevsky: Philosophy, Morality, Tragedy'' (Chicago: Northwestern University Press, 2016), {{ISBN|0810133962}}.

Many of his longer novels were first published in [[Serial (literature)|serialised form]] in literary magazines and journals. The years given below indicate the year in which the novel's final part or first complete book edition was published. In English many of his novels and stories are known by different titles.\n\n=== Major works ===\n==== ''Poor Folk'' ====\n{{Main|Poor Folk}}\n\n''Poor Folk'' is an [[epistolary novel]] that describes the relationship between the small, elderly official Makar Devushkin and the young seamstress Varvara Dobroselova, remote relatives who write letters to each other. Makar's tender, sentimental adoration for Varvara and her confident, warm friendship for him explain their evident preference for a simple life, although it keeps them in humiliating poverty. An unscrupulous merchant finds the inexperienced girl and hires her as his housewife and guarantor. He sends her to a manor somewhere on a steppe, while Makar alleviates his misery and pain with alcohol.\n\nThe story focuses on poor people who struggle with their lack of self-esteem. Their misery leads to the loss of their inner freedom, to dependence on the social authorities, and to the extinction of their individuality. Dostoevsky shows how poverty and dependence are indissolubly aligned with deflection and deformation of self-esteem, combining inward and outerward suffering.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=69\u2013103}}\n\n==== ''Notes from Underground'' ====\n{{Main|Notes from Underground}}\n\n''Notes from Underground'' is split into two stylistically different parts, the first essay-like, the second in narrative style. The protagonist and [[first-person narrator]] is an unnamed 40-year-old civil servant known as The Underground Man. The only known facts about his situation are that he has quit the service, lives in a basement flat on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg and finances his livelihood from a modest inheritance.\n\nThe first part is a record of his thoughts about society and his character. He describes himself as vicious, squalid and ugly; the chief focuses of his [[polemic]] are the \"modern human\" and his vision of the world, which he attacks severely and cynically, and towards which he develops aggression and vengefulness. He considers his own decline natural and necessary. Although he emphasises that he does not intend to publish his notes for the public, the narrator appeals repeatedly to an ill-described audience, whose questions he tries to address.\n\nIn the second part he describes scenes from his life that are responsible for his failure in personal and professional life and in his love life. He tells of meeting old school friends, who are in secure positions and treat him with condescension. His aggression turns inward on to himself and he tries to humiliate himself further. He presents himself as a possible saviour to the poor prostitute Lisa, advising her to reject self-reproach when she looks to him for hope. Dostoevsky added a short commentary saying that although the storyline and characters are fictional, such things were inevitable in contemporary society.\n\nThe Underground Man was very influential on philosophers. His alienated existence from the mainstream influenced [[modernist literature]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Halliwell|first=Martin|title=Transatlantic Modernism: Moral Dilemmas in Modernist Fiction|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=RXLT4Gu4aQ4C|page=13}}|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2393-8|page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eysteinsson|first=\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur|title=The Concept of Modernism|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=peKRAu4U458C|page=29}}|year=1990|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8077-5|page=29}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Crime and Punishment'' ====\n{{Main|Crime and Punishment}}\n\n''Crime and Punishment'' describes the fictional [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov|Rodion Raskolnikov]]'s life, from the murder of a pawnbroker and her sister, through spiritual regeneration with the help of Sonya (a \"[[hooker with a heart of gold]]\"), to his sentence in Siberia. Strakhov liked the novel, remarking that \"Only ''Crime and Punishment'' was read in 1866\" and that Dostoevsky had managed to portray a Russian person aptly and realistically.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|p=183}} Otherwise, it received a mixed reception from critics, with most of the negative responses coming from nihilists. [[Grigory Eliseev]] of the radical magazine ''[[The Contemporary]]'' called the novel a \"fantasy according to which the entire student body is accused without exception of attempting murder and robbery\".{{sfn|Frank|1997|p=45, 60\u2013182}}\n\n==== ''The Idiot'' ====\n{{Main|The Idiot}}\n\nThe novel's protagonist, the 26-year-old [[Prince Myshkin]], returns to Russia after several years at a Swiss sanatorium. Scorned by Saint Petersburg society for his trusting nature and naivety, he finds himself at the center of a struggle between a beautiful kept woman, Nastasya, and a jealous but pretty young girl, Aglaya, both of whom win his affection. Unfortunately, Myshkin's goodness precipitates disaster, leaving the impression that, in a world obsessed with money, power and sexual conquest, a sanatorium may be the only place for a saint. Myshkin is the personification of a \"relatively beautiful man\", namely Christ. Coming \"from above\" (the Swiss mountains), he physically resembles common depictions of [[Jesus Christ]]: slightly larger than average, with thick, blond hair, sunken cheeks and a thin, almost entirely white goatee. Like Christ, Myshkin is a teacher, confessor and mysterious outsider. Passions such as greed and jealousy are alien to him. In contrast to those around him, he puts no value on money and power. He feels compassion and love, sincerely, without judgment. His relationship with the immoral Nastasya is obviously inspired by Christ's relationship with [[Mary Magdalene]]. He is called \"Idiot\" because of such differences.{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=241\u2013363}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=274\u2013309}}\n\n==== ''Demons'' ====\n{{Main|Demons (Dostoevsky novel)}}\n\nThe story of ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (sometimes also titled ''The Possessed'' or ''The Devils'')<ref name=\"Demons-Possessed\" /> is based largely on the murder of Ivan Ivanov by \"People's Vengeance\" members in 1869. It was influenced by the [[Book of Revelation]]. The secondary characters, Pyotr and Stepan Verkhovensky, are based on [[Sergey Nechayev|Sergei Nechayev]] and [[Timofey Granovsky]] respectively.{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=310\u201322}} The novel takes place in a provincial Russian setting, primarily on the estates of Stepan Verkhovensky and Varvara Stavrogina. Stepan's son Pyotr is an aspiring revolutionary conspirator who attempts to organise revolutionaries in the area. He considers Varvara's son Nikolai central to his plot, because he thinks that Nikolai lacks sympathy for mankind. Pyotr gathers conspirators such as the philosophising Shigalyov, the suicidal Kirillov and the former military man Virginsky. He schemes to consolidate their loyalty to him and each other by murdering Ivan Shatov, a fellow conspirator. Pyotr plans to have Kirillov, who is committed to killing himself, take credit for the murder in his suicide note. Kirillov complies and Pyotr murders Shatov, but his scheme goes awry. Pyotr escapes, but the remainder of his aspiring revolutionary crew is arrested. In the denouement, Nikolai kills himself, tortured by his own misdeeds.\n\n==== ''The Brothers Karamazov'' ====\n{{Main|The Brothers Karamazov}}\n\nAt nearly 800 pages, ''The Brothers Karamazov'' is Dostoevsky's largest work. It received both critical and popular acclaim and is often cited as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.{{sfn|Frank|2003|pp=390\u2013441}} Composed of 12 \"books\", the novel tells the story of the novice [[Alyosha Karamazov]], the non-believer Ivan Karamazov and the soldier Dmitri Karamazov. The first books introduce the Karamazovs. The main plot is the death of their father Fyodor, while other parts are philosophical and religious arguments by Father Zosima to Alyosha.{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=567\u2013705}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=337\u2013414}}\n\nThe most famous chapter is \"[[The Grand Inquisitor]]\", a [[parable]] told by Ivan to Alyosha about Christ's [[Second Coming]] in [[Seville]], Spain, in which Christ is imprisoned by a ninety-year-old Catholic [[Grand Inquisitor]]. Instead of answering him, Christ gives him a kiss, and the Inquisitor subsequently releases him, telling him not to return. The tale was misunderstood as a defence of the Inquisitor, but some, such as [[Romano Guardini]], have argued that the Christ of the parable was Ivan's own interpretation of Christ, \"the idealistic product of the unbelief\". Ivan, however, has stated that he is against Christ. Most contemporary critics and scholars agree that Dostoevsky is attacking Roman Catholicism and socialist atheism, both represented by the Inquisitor. He warns the readers against a terrible revelation in the future, referring to the [[Donation of Pepin]] around 750 and the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the 16th century, which in his view corrupted true Christianity.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1982|pp=91\u2013103}}{{sfn|Frank|1997|pp=567\u2013705}}{{sfn|Kjetsaa|1989|pp=337\u2013414}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Main|Fyodor Dostoevsky bibliography}}\n{{col-begin}}\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n==== Novels and novellas ====\n* (1846) ''[[Poor Folk]]'' (novella)\n* (1846) ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' (novella)\n* (1847) ''[[The Landlady (novella)|The Landlady]]'' (novella)\n* (1849) ''[[Netochka Nezvanova (novel)|Netochka Nezvanova]]'' (unfinished)\n* (1859) ''[[Uncle's Dream]]'' (novella)\n* (1859) ''[[The Village of Stepanchikovo]]''\n* (1861) ''[[Humiliated and Insulted]]''\n* (1862) ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|The House of the Dead]]''\n* (1864) ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' (novella)\n* (1866) ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''\n* (1867) ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]'' (novella)\n* (1869) ''[[The Idiot]]''\n* (1870) ''[[The Eternal Husband]]'' (novella)\n* (1872) ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (also titled: ''The Possessed'', ''The Devils'')<ref name=\"Demons-Possessed\" />\n* (1875) ''[[The Adolescent]]''\n* (1880) ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n==== Short stories ====\n* (1846) \"[[Mr. Prokharchin]]\"\n* (1847) \"Novel in Nine Letters\"\n* (1848) \"[[Another Man's Wife and a Husband under the Bed]]\" (merger of \"Another Man's Wife\" and \"A Jealous Husband\")\n* (1848) \"A Weak Heart\"\n* (1848) \"Polzunkov\"\n* (1848) \"[[An Honest Thief]]\"\n* (1848) \"[[A Christmas Tree and a Wedding]]\"\n* (1848) \"[[White Nights (short story)|White Nights]]\"\n* (1849) \"A Little Hero\"\n* (1862) \"[[A Nasty Story]]\"\n* (1865) \"[[The Crocodile (short story)|The Crocodile]]\"\n* (1873) \"[[Bobok]]\"\n* (1876) \"[[The Beggar Boy at Christ's Christmas Tree|The Heavenly Christmas Tree]]\" (also titled: \"The Beggar Boy at Christ's Christmas Tree\")<ref>Dostoyefsky, F.M.  \"A Beggar Boy at Christ's Christmas Tree\" in ''Little Russian Masterpieces''.

Vehicles were stopped and searched for [[narcotics]] and [[illegal immigrant]]s. The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys' important [[tourism]] industry. [[Eastern Air Lines]], which had a hub at [[Miami International Airport]], saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only [[airline]] to establish [[jet aircraft|jet]] service to [[Key West International Airport]], counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles.\n\nWhen the City Council's complaints went unanswered by the U.S. federal government and attempts to get an [[injunction]] against the roadblock failed in court, as a form of protest Mayor [[Dennis Wardlow]] and the council declared Key West's independence on April 23, 1982. In the eyes of the council, since the U.S. federal government had set up the equivalent of a border station as if they were a foreign nation, they might as well become one. As many of the local citizens were referred to as [[Conch (people)|Conchs]], the nation took the name of the Conch Republic.\n\nAs part of the protest, Mayor Wardlow was proclaimed [[Prime Minister]] of the Republic, which immediately [[Declaration of war|declared war]] against the United States (symbolically breaking a loaf of stale [[Cuban bread]] over the head of a man dressed in a naval uniform), quickly surrendered after one minute (to the man in the uniform), and applied for one billion [[United States dollar|dollars]] in [[foreign aid]].\n\nConch Republic officials were invited to the [[Summit of the Americas]] in [[Miami]] in 1994, and Conch representatives were officially invited to 1995's Florida Jubilee.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Micronations |author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |page=131}}</ref>\n\nThe faux secession and the events surrounding it generated great publicity for the Keys' plight \u2014 the roadblock and inspection station were removed soon afterward.

However, no one from the 478th notified Conch officials of the exercise.\n\nSeeing another chance at publicity, Wardlow and the forces behind the 1982 Conch Republic secession mobilized the island for a full-scale war, sending the schooner [[Western Union (schooner)|''Western Union'']] out to attack an incoming Coast Guard Cutter with water balloons, conch fritters and stale Cuban bread, to which the Coast Guard responded with their fire hoses (quickly ending the battle), and protested to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for arranging this exercise without consulting the City of Key West.
