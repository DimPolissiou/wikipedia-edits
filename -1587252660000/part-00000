As a youth he worked briefly as a mail carrier in a steel mill and earned his [[Amateur radio]] license (W9QWN) at age 16, sometimes claiming he was even younger. He sporadically attended [[Indiana University]], but never graduated. Shepherd was a lifelong [[Chicago White Sox]] fan.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he served stateside in the [[U.S. Army]] [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].<ref name=\"Hammond\"/> Shepherd then had an extensive career in a variety of media.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio===\nAfter his military service, Shepherd began his broadcast radio career in early 1945 on [[WJOB (AM)|WJOB]] in Hammond, Indiana, later working at [[WWYC|WTOD]] in Toledo, Ohio, in 1946. He began working in Cincinnati, Ohio, in January 1947 at [[WSAI]], later also working at Cincinnati stations [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]] and [[WKRC (AM)|WKRC]] the following year, before returning to WSAI. From 1951 to 1953, he had a late-night broadcast on [[KYW (AM)|KYW]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, after which he returned to Cincinnati for several shows on [[WLW]]. After a stint on television, he returned to radio. \"Shep,\" as he was known, settled in at [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] radio New York City, New York, at the end of February 1955, and on an overnight slot in 1956,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=112 |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> where he delighted his fans<ref name=\"cult\">{{cite news\n |last=Phillips \n |first=McCandlish \n |title=400 Hold A Wake For Radio Cult \n |work=The New York Times \n |date=August 13, 1956 \n |url=http://www.flicklives.com/Articles/articles.asp?ID=19560813A \n |accessdate=2007-11-09 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807201412/http://www.flicklives.com/Articles/articles.asp?ID=19560813A \n |archivedate=August 7, 2007 \n}}</ref> by telling stories, reading poetry (especially the works of [[Robert Service (poet)|Robert W.

Ewing\", in 1956. During a discussion on how easy it was to manipulate the best seller lists based on demand as well as sales, Shepherd suggested that his listeners visit bookstores and ask for a copy of ''I, Libertine'' which led to booksellers attempting to order the book from their distributors. Fans of the show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldnews.com/bloggers/x35033844/All-I-want-for-Christmas-is-my-name-on-the-Bestsellers-List |title=All I want for Christmas is my name on the Bestseller's List |last=Lortie |first=Arthur |date=17 December 2012 |work=The Herald News |accessdate=2013-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105035455/http://www.heraldnews.com/bloggers/x35033844/All-I-want-for-Christmas-is-my-name-on-the-Bestsellers-List |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> Shepherd, [[Theodore Sturgeon]] and [[Betty Ballantine]] later wrote the demanded book, with a cover painted by illustrator Frank Kelly Freas, published by [[Ballantine Books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.goodreadingmagazine.com.au/?iid=7794 |title=Good Reading |website=Digital.goodreadingmagazine.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> \n\nAmong his close friends in the late 1950s were [[Shel Silverstein]] and [[Herb Gardner]]. With them and actress [[Lois Nettleton]], Shepherd performed in the revue he created, ''Look, Charlie''. Later he was married to Nettleton for about six years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E3DA1639F934A25753C1A96F958260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=Jean Shepherd, a Raconteur Of the Radio, Dies in Florida |last=Ramirez|first=Anthony|date=October 17, 1999|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was about to be released by WOR in 1956 for lack of sponsors, he did a commercial for ''Sweetheart Soap'', not a sponsor, and was immediately fired. His listeners besieged WOR with complaints, and when Sweetheart offered to sponsor him he was reinstated. Eventually, he attracted more sponsors than he wanted\u2014the commercials interrupted the flow of his monologues. Ex WOR engineer, Frank Cernese, adds: The commercials of that era were on \"ETs\"\u2014phonograph records about 14\" in diameter. Three large turntables were available to play them in sequence. Shepherd preferred the engineer to watch and listen to his stories. That left little time to load the turntables and cue the appropriate cuts. That's when he started complaining about \"too many commercials\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} \n\nHis last WOR broadcast was on April 1, 1977. His subsequent radio work consisted of short segments on several other stations, including crosstown [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]], and occasional commentaries on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''. His final radio gig was the Sunday night radio show \"Shepherd's Pie\" on [[WBAI]] in the mid-1990s, which had him reading his stories uncut, uninterrupted and unabridged. The show was one of WBAI's most popular of the period. In addition to his stories, his shows also contained humorous anecdotes and commentaries about the human condition, observations about New York City life, accounts of vacations in [[Maine]] and travels throughout the world. One striking program recounted his participation in the [[March on Washington]] in August 1963, during which [[Dr. Martin Luther King]] gave his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, and another program that aired on November 25, 1963 covered the burial day of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. His most scintillating programs however, were his often prophetic, bitingly humorous commentaries about ordinary life in America.\n\nThroughout his radio career, he performed entirely without scripts. His friend and WOR colleague [[Barry Farber]] marveled at how he could talk so long with so few notes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} During a radio interview, Shepherd claimed that some shows took weeks to prepare, but this may have been in the planning rather than the writing of a script. On most of his Fourth of July broadcasts, he did read one of his most enduring and popular short stories, \"Ludlow Kissel and the Dago Bomb that Struck Back,\" about a neighborhood drunk and his disastrous fireworks escapades. In the 1960s and 1970s, his WOR show ran from 11:15&nbsp;pm to midnight, later changed to 10:15&nbsp;pm to 11&nbsp;pm, so his \"Ludlow Kissel\" reading was synchronized to many [[New Jersey]] and New York local town [[fireworks]] displays, which would typically reach their climax at 10&nbsp;pm. It was possible, on one of those July 4 nights, to park one's car on a hilltop and watch several different [[pyrotechnic]] displays, accompanied by Shepherd's masterful storytelling.\n\n===Print===\n[[File:Libertineback.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Jean Shepherd posed as Frederick R. Ewing on the back cover of Ballantine's ''[[I, Libertine]]'' (1956).]]Shepherd wrote a series of humorous short stories about growing up in northwest [[Indiana]] and its steel towns, many of which were first told by him on his programs and then published in ''[[Playboy]]''. The stories were later assembled into books titled ''[[In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash]]'', ''Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories: and Other Disasters'', ''The Ferrari in the Bedroom'', and ''A Fistful of Fig Newtons''. Some of those situations were incorporated into his movies and television fictional stories. He also wrote a column for the early ''[[Village Voice]]'', a column for ''[[Car and Driver]]'', numerous individual articles for diverse publications, including ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad Magazine]]'' (\"The Night People vs. Creeping Meatballism\", March/April 1957), and introductions for books such as ''[[The America of George Ade]]'', ''[[American Snapshots]]'', and the 1970 reprint of the 1929 ''[[Johnson Smith Catalogue]]''.<ref name=\"Bergmann\">{{cite book|last1=Bergmann|first1=Eugene|title=Excelsior, You Fathead!: The Art and Enigma of Jean Shepherd|date=November 1, 2004|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|location=[[Winona, Minnesota]]|isbn=978-1-55783-600-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/excelsioryoufath00berg}}</ref>\n\nWhen Eugene B. Bergmann's ''Excelsior, You Fathead! The Art and Enigma of Jean Shepherd'' was published in 2005, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed:\n\n<blockquote>This prismatic portrait affirms Shepherd's position as one of the 20th century's great humorists. Railing against conformity, he forged a unique personal bond with his loyal listeners, who participated in his legendary literary prank by asking bookstores for the nonexistent novel ''[[I, Libertine]]'' (when publisher Ian Ballantine had Shepherd, author Theodore Sturgeon, and illustrator [[Frank Kelly Freas]] make the fake real, ''PW'' called it \"the hoax that became a book\"). Storyteller Shepherd's grand theme was life itself ... Novelist Bergmann (''Rio Amazonas'') interviewed 32 people who knew Shepherd or were influenced by him and listened to hundreds of broadcast tapes, inserting transcripts of Shepherd's own words into a \"biographical framework\" of exhaustive research.<ref>''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', vol. 252, no. 4 (2005), p. 233.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''Shep's Army: Bummers, Blisters, and Boondoggles'', almost three dozen of Jean Shepherd's radio stories about the army, transcribed, edited and introduced by Eugene B. Bergmann, is a book of stories by Shepherd, never before in print. (Opus Books, August 2013)\n\n===Television and films===\n{{refimprovesect|date=January 2020}}\nEarly in his career, Shepherd had a television program on WLW-TV in Cincinnati called ''Rear Bumper''.<ref name=\"Hammond\"/> He claimed that he was recommended to replace the resigning [[Steve Allen]] on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]''. Shepherd was reportedly brought to New York City by [[NBC]] executives to prepare for the position, but they were contractually bound to first offer it to [[Jack Paar]]. The network was certain Paar would hold out for a role in prime time, but he accepted the late-night assignment. However, he did not assume the position permanently until Shepherd and [[Ernie Kovacs]] had co-hosted the show.\n\nIn late 1960 and early 1961, he did a weekly television show on WOR (channel 9) in New York, but it did not last long. Between 1971 and 1994, Shepherd became a screenwriter of note, writing and producing numerous works for both television and cinema, all based on his originally spoken and written stories. He was the writer and narrator of the show ''Jean Shepherd's America'', produced by Boston [[Public Television]] station [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] for [[PBS]], in which he  visited various American locales, and interviewed local people of interest. He used a somewhat similar format for the [[New Jersey Network]] TV show ''Shepherd's Pie''. On many of the Public TV shows he wrote, directed and edited entire shows.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nHe also wrote and narrated many works, the most famous being the 1983 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] feature film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', which is now considered a holiday classic. Shepherd narrates the film as the adult Ralph Parker, and also has a [[cameo role]] playing a man in line at the [[department store]] waiting for [[Santa Claus]].\n\n[[PBS]] aired several television movies based on Shepherd stories, also featuring the Parker family. These included ''The Phantom of the Open Hearth'' (1976), which aired as part of the anthology series ''[[Visions (TV series)|Visions]]''; ''The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters'' (1982) and ''The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski'' (1985), both as part of the anthology series ''[[American Playhouse]]''; and ''[[Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss]]'' (1988), a co-production with [[The Disney Channel]].  All were narrated by Shepherd but otherwise featured different casts.\n\nOnce Shepherd noticed the amount of money he was making from reruns of ''A Christmas Story'' (which was slowly becoming a television tradition), he abandoned television; in 1994, he and ''A Christmas Story'' director [[Bob Clark]] returned to the same working-class Cleveland street neighborhood to film a sequel, ''[[It Runs in the Family (1994 film)|It Runs in the Family]]'' (later known as ''My Summer Story''), released by MGM in 1994 and (because the 11-year span between films caused almost all the actors to age out of their roles) featuring an almost entirely different cast from the previous film.\n\n===Live performances and recordings===\nOn Saturday nights for several years, Shepherd broadcast his WOR radio program live from the Limelight Cafe in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], and he also performed at many colleges nationwide. His live shows were a perennial favorite{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} at [[Rutgers]] to wildly enthusiastic standing room only crowds, and [[Fairleigh Dickinson University|Fairleigh Dickinson]] Universities (he often referred to the latter as \"Fairly Ridiculous University\" on his WOR show).  He performed at [[Princeton University]] for over 30 years, beginning in 1956 until 1996, three years before his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=236&title=Princeton%20University |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> \nHe performed before sold-out audiences at [[Carnegie Hall]] and Town Hall.\n\nHe was also emcee for several important jazz concerts in the late 1950s. Shepherd's first known recording featured  his short comments interspersed with jazz pieces. The title: Jean Shepherd\u2014Into the Unknown With Jazz Music (1955). Shepherd [[improvised]] spoken word narration for the title track on [[jazz]] musician [[Charles Mingus]]'s 1957 album ''[[The Clown (album)|The Clown]]''. Eight record albums of live and studio performances of Shepherd were released between 1955 and 1975.

Sometimes Shepherd would accompany the recordings by playing the [[Jew's harp]], [[nose flute]], or [[kazoo]], and occasionally even by thumping his knuckles on his head.\n\nJean famously narrated the 1957 [[Atlantic Records]] [[Charles Mingus]] masterpiece, [[The Clown (album)|The Clown]], including the title track to the album.\n\nThe theme song of his show was \"Bahn Frei!\" by [[Eduard Strauss]]. The particular version Shepherd used was a recording by [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops]], with arrangement by Peter Bodge, released in April 1946 by RCA Victor-Red Seal. This arrangement recast the 19th-century polka from one relating to travel by train to a fast-tempo piece directed to horses and a race track, principally achieved by opening with a well-known bugle call named \"[[First call|Call to the Post]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=271 |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nShepherd kept most of his personal life secret, from both his radio audience and most of his friends.

Shepherd always referred to him as \"the old man.\" During an interview on the ''[[Long John Nebel]] Show''\u2014an all-night radio program that ran on [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] starting at midnight\u2014Shepherd once claimed that his real father was a cartoonist along the lines of [[Herblock]], and that he inherited his skills at line drawings. This may well have not been true but Shepherd's ink drawings do adorn some of his published writings, and a number of previously unknown ones were sold on [[eBay]] from his former wife [[Lois Nettleton]]'s collection after her death in 2008.\n\nThe 1930 Federal Census Record for [[Hammond, Indiana]], indicates that Jean's father did work for a dairy company. His actual occupation reads \"cashier.\" The 1930 census record (which misspells the last name as \"Shephard\" when searching) lists the following family members: Jean Shepherd, age 30, head; Anna Shepherd, age 30, wife; Jean Shepherd Jr, age 8, son; and Randall Shepherd, age 6, son. According to this record, Jean Sr, Anna, Jean Jr, and Randall were all born in Illinois, and Jean Sr's parents (Emmett and Flora) were born in Kansas. However, all other decennial federal and state census records, as well as other official documents such as death certificates, indicate that Emmett and Flora were born in Indiana. Anna's parents, August and Katherine, were born in Germany.\n\nJean Shepherd had two children, a son Randall and a daughter Adrian, with his second wife Joan but he publicly denied this, including in his last will and testament, executed some five months prior to his death. Randall Shepherd describes his father as having frequently come home late or not at all. Randall had almost no contact with him after his parents' divorce.<ref name=\"Randall\">{{cite web|last=Shepherd |first=Randall |title=One More Hat on a Man |work=Shep's vast file of dynamic trivia: People in Shep's Life |publisher=Jim Clavin |year=2006 |url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=358 |accessdate=October 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918231232/http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=358 |archivedate=September 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nShepherd's [[Speech communication|oral]] [[narrative]] style was a [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] to that used by [[Spalding Gray]] and [[Garrison Keillor]].

As a youth he worked briefly as a mail carrier in a steel mill and earned his [[Amateur radio]] license (W9QWN) at age 16, sometimes claiming he was even younger. He sporadically attended [[Indiana University]], but never graduated. Shepherd was a lifelong [[Chicago White Sox]] fan.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he served stateside in the [[U.S. Army]] [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].<ref name=\"Hammond\"/> Shepherd then had an extensive career in a variety of media.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio===\nAfter his military service, Shepherd began his broadcast radio career in early 1945 on [[WJOB (AM)|WJOB]] in Hammond, Indiana, later working at [[WWYC|WTOD]] in Toledo, Ohio, in 1946. He began working in Cincinnati, Ohio, in January 1947 at [[WSAI]], later also working at Cincinnati stations [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]] and [[WKRC (AM)|WKRC]] the following year, before returning to WSAI. From 1951 to 1953, he had a late-night broadcast on [[KYW (AM)|KYW]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, after which he returned to Cincinnati for several shows on [[WLW]]. After a stint on television, he returned to radio. \"Shep,\" as he was known, settled in at [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] radio New York City, New York, at the end of February 1955, and on an overnight slot in 1956,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=112 |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> where he delighted his fans<ref name=\"cult\">{{cite news\n |last=Phillips \n |first=McCandlish \n |title=400 Hold A Wake For Radio Cult \n |work=The New York Times \n |date=August 13, 1956 \n |url=http://www.flicklives.com/Articles/articles.asp?ID=19560813A \n |accessdate=2007-11-09 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807201412/http://www.flicklives.com/Articles/articles.asp?ID=19560813A \n |archivedate=August 7, 2007 \n}}</ref> by telling stories, reading poetry (especially the works of [[Robert Service (poet)|Robert W.

Ewing\", in 1956. During a discussion on how easy it was to manipulate the best seller lists based on demand as well as sales, Shepherd suggested that his listeners visit bookstores and ask for a copy of ''I, Libertine'' which led to booksellers attempting to order the book from their distributors. Fans of the show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldnews.com/bloggers/x35033844/All-I-want-for-Christmas-is-my-name-on-the-Bestsellers-List |title=All I want for Christmas is my name on the Bestseller's List |last=Lortie |first=Arthur |date=17 December 2012 |work=The Herald News |accessdate=2013-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105035455/http://www.heraldnews.com/bloggers/x35033844/All-I-want-for-Christmas-is-my-name-on-the-Bestsellers-List |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> Shepherd, [[Theodore Sturgeon]] and [[Betty Ballantine]] later wrote the demanded book, with a cover painted by illustrator Frank Kelly Freas, published by [[Ballantine Books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.goodreadingmagazine.com.au/?iid=7794 |title=Good Reading |website=Digital.goodreadingmagazine.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> \n\nAmong his close friends in the late 1950s were [[Shel Silverstein]] and [[Herb Gardner]]. With them and actress [[Lois Nettleton]], Shepherd performed in the revue he created, ''Look, Charlie''. Later he was married to Nettleton for about six years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E3DA1639F934A25753C1A96F958260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=Jean Shepherd, a Raconteur Of the Radio, Dies in Florida |last=Ramirez|first=Anthony|date=October 17, 1999|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was about to be released by WOR in 1956 for lack of sponsors, he did a commercial for ''Sweetheart Soap'', not a sponsor, and was immediately fired. His listeners besieged WOR with complaints, and when Sweetheart offered to sponsor him he was reinstated. Eventually, he attracted more sponsors than he wanted\u2014the commercials interrupted the flow of his monologues. Ex WOR engineer, Frank Cernese, adds: The commercials of that era were on \"ETs\"\u2014phonograph records about 14\" in diameter. Three large turntables were available to play them in sequence. Shepherd preferred the engineer to watch and listen to his stories. That left little time to load the turntables and cue the appropriate cuts. That's when he started complaining about \"too many commercials\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} \n\nHis last WOR broadcast was on April 1, 1977. His subsequent radio work consisted of short segments on several other stations, including crosstown [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]], and occasional commentaries on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''. His final radio gig was the Sunday night radio show \"Shepherd's Pie\" on [[WBAI]] in the mid-1990s, which had him reading his stories uncut, uninterrupted and unabridged. The show was one of WBAI's most popular of the period. In addition to his stories, his shows also contained humorous anecdotes and commentaries about the human condition, observations about New York City life, accounts of vacations in [[Maine]] and travels throughout the world. One striking program recounted his participation in the [[March on Washington]] in August 1963, during which [[Dr. Martin Luther King]] gave his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, and another program that aired on November 25, 1963 covered the burial day of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. His most scintillating programs however, were his often prophetic, bitingly humorous commentaries about ordinary life in America.\n\nThroughout his radio career, he performed entirely without scripts. His friend and WOR colleague [[Barry Farber]] marveled at how he could talk so long with so few notes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} During a radio interview, Shepherd claimed that some shows took weeks to prepare, but this may have been in the planning rather than the writing of a script. On most of his Fourth of July broadcasts, he did read one of his most enduring and popular short stories, \"Ludlow Kissel and the Dago Bomb that Struck Back,\" about a neighborhood drunk and his disastrous fireworks escapades. In the 1960s and 1970s, his WOR show ran from 11:15&nbsp;pm to midnight, later changed to 10:15&nbsp;pm to 11&nbsp;pm, so his \"Ludlow Kissel\" reading was synchronized to many [[New Jersey]] and New York local town [[fireworks]] displays, which would typically reach their climax at 10&nbsp;pm. It was possible, on one of those July 4 nights, to park one's car on a hilltop and watch several different [[pyrotechnic]] displays, accompanied by Shepherd's masterful storytelling.\n\n===Print===\n[[File:Libertineback.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Jean Shepherd posed as Frederick R. Ewing on the back cover of Ballantine's ''[[I, Libertine]]'' (1956).]]Shepherd wrote a series of humorous short stories about growing up in northwest [[Indiana]] and its steel towns, many of which were first told by him on his programs and then published in ''[[Playboy]]''. The stories were later assembled into books titled ''[[In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash]]'', ''Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories: and Other Disasters'', ''The Ferrari in the Bedroom'', and ''A Fistful of Fig Newtons''. Some of those situations were incorporated into his movies and television fictional stories. He also wrote a column for the early ''[[Village Voice]]'', a column for ''[[Car and Driver]]'', numerous individual articles for diverse publications, including ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad Magazine]]'' (\"The Night People vs. Creeping Meatballism\", March/April 1957), and introductions for books such as ''[[The America of George Ade]]'', ''[[American Snapshots]]'', and the 1970 reprint of the 1929 ''[[Johnson Smith Catalogue]]''.<ref name=\"Bergmann\">{{cite book|last1=Bergmann|first1=Eugene|title=Excelsior, You Fathead!: The Art and Enigma of Jean Shepherd|date=November 1, 2004|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|location=[[Winona, Minnesota]]|isbn=978-1-55783-600-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/excelsioryoufath00berg}}</ref>\n\nWhen Eugene B. Bergmann's ''Excelsior, You Fathead! The Art and Enigma of Jean Shepherd'' was published in 2005, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed:\n\n<blockquote>This prismatic portrait affirms Shepherd's position as one of the 20th century's great humorists. Railing against conformity, he forged a unique personal bond with his loyal listeners, who participated in his legendary literary prank by asking bookstores for the nonexistent novel ''[[I, Libertine]]'' (when publisher Ian Ballantine had Shepherd, author Theodore Sturgeon, and illustrator [[Frank Kelly Freas]] make the fake real, ''PW'' called it \"the hoax that became a book\"). Storyteller Shepherd's grand theme was life itself ... Novelist Bergmann (''Rio Amazonas'') interviewed 32 people who knew Shepherd or were influenced by him and listened to hundreds of broadcast tapes, inserting transcripts of Shepherd's own words into a \"biographical framework\" of exhaustive research.<ref>''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', vol. 252, no. 4 (2005), p. 233.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''Shep's Army: Bummers, Blisters, and Boondoggles'', almost three dozen of Jean Shepherd's radio stories about the army, transcribed, edited and introduced by Eugene B. Bergmann, is a book of stories by Shepherd, never before in print. (Opus Books, August 2013)\n\n===Television and films===\n{{refimprovesect|date=January 2020}}\nEarly in his career, Shepherd had a television program on WLW-TV in Cincinnati called ''Rear Bumper''.<ref name=\"Hammond\"/> He claimed that he was recommended to replace the resigning [[Steve Allen]] on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]''. Shepherd was reportedly brought to New York City by [[NBC]] executives to prepare for the position, but they were contractually bound to first offer it to [[Jack Paar]]. The network was certain Paar would hold out for a role in prime time, but he accepted the late-night assignment. However, he did not assume the position permanently until Shepherd and [[Ernie Kovacs]] had co-hosted the show.\n\nIn late 1960 and early 1961, he did a weekly television show on WOR (channel 9) in New York, but it did not last long. Between 1971 and 1994, Shepherd became a screenwriter of note, writing and producing numerous works for both television and cinema, all based on his originally spoken and written stories. He was the writer and narrator of the show ''Jean Shepherd's America'', produced by Boston [[Public Television]] station [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] for [[PBS]], in which he  visited various American locales, and interviewed local people of interest. He used a somewhat similar format for the [[New Jersey Network]] TV show ''Shepherd's Pie''. On many of the Public TV shows he wrote, directed and edited entire shows.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nHe also wrote and narrated many works, the most famous being the 1983 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] feature film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', which is now considered a holiday classic. Shepherd narrates the film as the adult Ralph Parker, and also has a [[cameo role]] playing a man in line at the [[department store]] waiting for [[Santa Claus]].\n\n[[PBS]] aired several television movies based on Shepherd stories, also featuring the Parker family. These included ''The Phantom of the Open Hearth'' (1976), which aired as part of the anthology series ''[[Visions (TV series)|Visions]]''; ''The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters'' (1982) and ''The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski'' (1985), both as part of the anthology series ''[[American Playhouse]]''; and ''[[Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss]]'' (1988), a co-production with [[The Disney Channel]].  All were narrated by Shepherd but otherwise featured different casts.\n\nOnce Shepherd noticed the amount of money he was making from reruns of ''A Christmas Story'' (which was slowly becoming a television tradition), he abandoned television; in 1994, he and ''A Christmas Story'' director [[Bob Clark]] returned to the same working-class Cleveland street neighborhood to film a sequel, ''[[It Runs in the Family (1994 film)|It Runs in the Family]]'' (later known as ''My Summer Story''), released by MGM in 1994 and (because the 11-year span between films caused almost all the actors to age out of their roles) featuring an almost entirely different cast from the previous film.\n\n===Live performances and recordings===\nOn Saturday nights for several years, Shepherd broadcast his WOR radio program live from the Limelight Cafe in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], and he also performed at many colleges nationwide. His live shows were a perennial favorite{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} at [[Rutgers]] to wildly enthusiastic standing room only crowds, and [[Fairleigh Dickinson University|Fairleigh Dickinson]] Universities (he often referred to the latter as \"Fairly Ridiculous University\" on his WOR show).  He performed at [[Princeton University]] for over 30 years, beginning in 1956 until 1996, three years before his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=236&title=Princeton%20University |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> \nHe performed before sold-out audiences at [[Carnegie Hall]] and Town Hall.\n\nHe was also emcee for several important jazz concerts in the late 1950s. Shepherd's first known recording featured  his short comments interspersed with jazz pieces. The title: Jean Shepherd\u2014Into the Unknown With Jazz Music (1955). Shepherd [[improvised]] spoken word narration for the title track on [[jazz]] musician [[Charles Mingus]]'s 1957 album ''[[The Clown (album)|The Clown]]''. Eight record albums of live and studio performances of Shepherd were released between 1955 and 1975. In 1993, Shepherd recorded the opening narration and the voice of the [[Audio-Animatronics]] \"Father\" character for the updated [[Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress|Carousel of Progress]] attraction at [[Walt Disney World]] [[Magic Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dezern|first1=Craig|title=Work is scheduled to start ...|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-07-26/business/9307240924_1_tomorrowland-carousel-yesterday-tomorrows|website=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=March 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329172447/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-07-26/business/9307240924_1_tomorrowland-carousel-yesterday-tomorrows|archivedate=March 29, 2015|date=July 26, 1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lafferty|first1=Mike|title=Around The Worlds|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-11-24/news/9311240874_1_janet-waldo-wet-magic-kingdom|website=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=March 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329171809/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-11-24/news/9311240874_1_janet-waldo-wet-magic-kingdom|archivedate=March 29, 2015|date=November 24, 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nOn some of his broadcasts he played parts of recordings of such novelty songs as \"[[The Bear Missed the Train]]\" (a [[parody]] of the [[Yiddish]] [[ballad]] \"[[Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen]]\") and \"[[The Sheik of Araby]]\". Sometimes Shepherd would accompany the recordings by playing the [[Jew's harp]], [[nose flute]], or [[kazoo]], and occasionally even by thumping his knuckles on his head.\n\nJean famously narrated the 1957 [[Atlantic Records]] [[Charles Mingus]] masterpiece, [[The Clown (album)|The Clown]], including the title track to the album.\n\nThe theme song of his show was \"Bahn Frei!\" by [[Eduard Strauss]]. The particular version Shepherd used was a recording by [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops]], with arrangement by Peter Bodge, released in April 1946 by RCA Victor-Red Seal. This arrangement recast the 19th-century polka from one relating to travel by train to a fast-tempo piece directed to horses and a race track, principally achieved by opening with a well-known bugle call named \"[[First call|Call to the Post]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=271 |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nShepherd kept most of his personal life secret, from both his radio audience and most of his friends. Married four times, he lived in several New York City locations during his WOR days and for a time in New Milford (Bergen County), New Jersey, and in Washington (Warren County), New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=312 |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date=1984-03-01 |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> In 1984, he moved to [[Sanibel, Florida|Sanibel Island]], Florida, with his wife Leigh Brown.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Bill|title=Jean Shepherd's Great Escape|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-04-07/features/8501130429_1_jean-shepherd-christmas-morning-rifle|website=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=March 29, 2015|date=April 7, 1985}}</ref> He died in a hospital in nearby Fort Myers, Florida, in 1999 of [[natural causes]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ramirez|first1=Anthony|title=Jean Shepherd, a Raconteur And a Wit of Radio, Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/18/nyregion/jean-shepherd-a-raconteur-and-a-wit-of-radio-is-dead.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=March 29, 2015|date=October 18, 1999}}</ref>\n\nShepherd maintained his interest in amateur radio throughout his life. After leaving Hammond, he obtained the call signs W4QWN (Kentucky), W8QWN (Ohio) and W3STE (Pennsylvania). Upon his arrival at WOR in New York in 1955, he obtained the call K2ORS, with which he would often be heard speaking to other ham radio operators for the remainder of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=318 |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Fact and fiction==\nIt is unknown to what extent Shepherd's radio and published stories were fact, fiction or a combination of the two. The childhood friends included in many of his stories were people he claimed to have invented, yet high school yearbooks and numerous other sources confirm that many of them, including school buddies \"Flick\" and \"Schwartz,\" did indeed exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=350 |title=Vast File of Dynamic Trivia |website=Flicklives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> His father was a cashier at the [[Borden, Inc.|Borden Milk Company]]. Shepherd always referred to him as \"the old man.\" During an interview on the ''[[Long John Nebel]] Show''\u2014an all-night radio program that ran on [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] starting at midnight\u2014Shepherd once claimed that his real father was a cartoonist along the lines of [[Herblock]], and that he inherited his skills at line drawings. This may well have not been true but Shepherd's ink drawings do adorn some of his published writings, and a number of previously unknown ones were sold on [[eBay]] from his former wife [[Lois Nettleton]]'s collection after her death in 2008.\n\nThe 1930 Federal Census Record for [[Hammond, Indiana]], indicates that Jean's father did work for a dairy company. His actual occupation reads \"cashier.\" The 1930 census record (which misspells the last name as \"Shephard\" when searching) lists the following family members: Jean Shepherd, age 30, head; Anna Shepherd, age 30, wife; Jean Shepherd Jr, age 8, son; and Randall Shepherd, age 6, son. According to this record, Jean Sr, Anna, Jean Jr, and Randall were all born in Illinois, and Jean Sr's parents (Emmett and Flora) were born in Kansas. However, all other decennial federal and state census records, as well as other official documents such as death certificates, indicate that Emmett and Flora were born in Indiana. Anna's parents, August and Katherine, were born in Germany.\n\nJean Shepherd had two children, a son Randall and a daughter Adrian, with his second wife Joan but he publicly denied this, including in his last will and testament, executed some five months prior to his death. Randall Shepherd describes his father as having frequently come home late or not at all. Randall had almost no contact with him after his parents' divorce.<ref name=\"Randall\">{{cite web|last=Shepherd |first=Randall |title=One More Hat on a Man |work=Shep's vast file of dynamic trivia: People in Shep's Life |publisher=Jim Clavin |year=2006 |url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=358 |accessdate=October 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918231232/http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=358 |archivedate=September 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nShepherd's [[Speech communication|oral]] [[narrative]] style was a [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] to that used by [[Spalding Gray]] and [[Garrison Keillor]].

Griffith explained, \"The inspiration\u2014just plucking random memories from my childhood, as I'm wont to do in my Sunday strip (also a way to expand beyond Zippy)\u2014and Shep was a big part of them\".\n\nIn an interview with ''New York'' magazine, [[Steely Dan]]'s [[Donald Fagen]] says that the eponymous figure from his solo album ''[[The Nightfly]]'' was based on Jean Shepherd.\n\nThough he primarily spent his radio career playing music, New York Top 40 DJ [[Dan Ingram]] has acknowledged Shepherd's style as an influence.\n\nAn article he wrote for the March\u2013April 1957 issue of [[MAD Magazine|''MAD'' magazine]], \"The Night People vs Creeping Meatballism\", described the differences between what he considered to be \"day people\" (conformists) and \"night people\" (non-conformists). The opening credits of [[John Cassavetes]]' 1959 film ''[[Shadows (1959 film)|Shadows]]'' include \"Presented by Jean Shepherd's Night People\".\n\nIn 2005, Shepherd was posthumously inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]], and in November 2013 he was posthumously inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/ |title=Innovators in Philly |publisher=Broadcast Pioneers |date= |accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''[[I, Libertine]]'' (1956, hoax novel perpetrated by Shepherd, written by [[Theodore Sturgeon]] as \"Frederick R.

He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"privileged\",<ref name=\"Munly Vents\" /> \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on. She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well.<ref name=\"Munly Syffal\">{{cite news |last1=Frieders |first1=Joel |title=Our Interview With Munly J.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"'' <ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave |language=Russian}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC Lonesome\">{{cite news |last1=Rapid |first1=Steve |title=Slim Cessna: An Introduction to Young and Old Ireland |url=https://www.lonesomehighway.com/interviewsold/2017/10/3/slim-cessna-interview.html |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=Lonesome Highway |date=October 3, 2017 |ref=SC Lonesome}}</ref> [[David Byrne]],<ref name=\"SCAC San Diego\">{{cite news |last1=Roche |first1=Donovan |title=Slim Cessna's hillbilly hootenanny |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/feb/24/concert-slim-cessnas-hillbilly-hootenany/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=San Diego Reader |date=February 24, 2017 |ref=SCAC San Diego}}</ref> and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"privileged\",<ref name=\"Munly Vents\" /> \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on. She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well.<ref name=\"Munly Syffal\">{{cite news |last1=Frieders |first1=Joel |title=Our Interview With Munly J.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC Lonesome\">{{cite news |last1=Rapid |first1=Steve |title=Slim Cessna: An Introduction to Young and Old Ireland |url=https://www.lonesomehighway.com/interviewsold/2017/10/3/slim-cessna-interview.html |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=Lonesome Highway |date=October 3, 2017 |ref=SC Lonesome}}</ref> [[David Byrne]],<ref name=\"SCAC San Diego\">{{cite news |last1=Roche |first1=Donovan |title=Slim Cessna's hillbilly hootenanny |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/feb/24/concert-slim-cessnas-hillbilly-hootenany/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=San Diego Reader |date=February 24, 2017 |ref=SCAC San Diego}}</ref> and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

[[Paramount Pictures]] and Roddenberry began developing a new series, ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'', in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity.

The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.\n\nThe success of the sequel, ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six ''Star Trek'' feature films between 1979 and 1991.\n\nIn response to the popularity of ''Star Trek'' feature films, the franchise returned to television with ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' in 1987.

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline.

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]].

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh ''Star Trek'' film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that \"this is not your father's ''Star Trek''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103824300|title=Some Older 'Star Trek' Fans May Skip This Voyage|last=Adler|first=Margo|date=2009-05-06|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> It also would not interfere with CBS's franchise.\n\nThe film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing (in inflation-adjusted dollars) more box office sales than any previous ''Star Trek'' film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airlockalpha.com/6469/star-trek-becomes-highest-grossing-franchise-film-html|title='Star Trek' Becomes Highest Grossing Franchise Film|last=Hinman|first=Michael|date=2009-06-23|website=[[Airlock Alpha]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> The plaudits include the franchise's first [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|makeup]]).

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]]. National Amusements and the Redstone family retained approximately 80% ownership of both CBS and Viacom.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=National Amusements, Inc.

However, CBS held all copyrights, marks, production assets, and film negatives, to all ''Star Trek'' television series.

It was unclear if CBS retained some, if not all, [[Synchronization rights|synchronization]] or [[streaming media|streaming]] rights.\n\nRights issues and the fraught relationship between the leadership at CBS, Viacom, and National Amusements resulted in a number of delayed and or cancelled ''Star Trek'' productions.<ref>{{Cite
