According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} It is surrounded by farms, small mountains, plains, and trees. Pililla is known as the Green Field Municipality of Rizal.\n\nPililla has preserved some religious and non-religious traditions such as the Santa Cruzan or Flores de Mayo, wherein men and women walk all over town with their gowns. Town Fiesta during the month of July is being visited by people from the city to experience the celebrations especially the amateur shows at night. Like other towns, Pililla holds basketball league competitions for youth during summer. Pililla is also a destination for road cyclists because of its asphalted road, specifically in Sitio Bugarin in Barangay Halayhayin.\n\n==History==\nPilang Munti (Pililla\u2019s pre-Hispanic name) was ruled by a leader named Salyan Maginto. His territory encompasses the modern-day jurisdiction of the municipalities of Baras, Tanay, Pililla, and Jalajala. It was referenced as \u201c''munti''\u201d in contrast to the nearby and much larger town of [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the province of Laguna.\n\nCavada, a Spanish historian, revealed that in the year 1571, the Spanish forces conquered the towns along Laguna de Bay which they called \u201cRinconada de Moron\u201d and Pilang Munti was among these which surrendered to the superior force of the Spaniards. Pilang Munti was incorporated into the colonial administration of Morong, and thus, the town was called \"Pilang Morong\".\n\nIn 1572, the first Spanish missionary priests arrived at Pilang Morong. Since then, Christianity was spread by the Spanish priests and in 1582, Fr. Juan de Placencia and Fr. Diego de Oropesa established a \u201cvisita\u201d barrio at Pilang Morong. The place was divided by the Spaniards into 5 \u201c''rancherias''\u201d:\n\n* Monte Tan-ay\n* Sitio Tigbi (Lulukong)\n* San Diego\n* Monte Yakat\n* Dolo Rio (Wawa)\n\nIn 1583, Pilang Morong became an independent municipality. \u201dPililla\u201d was given as the official name of the newly formed town. The name \u201cPililla\u201d arose from the diminutive rules in the Castillan language by modifying a name with \u201c''-illa''\u201d or \u201c''-illo''\u201d to indicate a smaller or younger version.\n\nIn 1599, 16 years after the town was given autonomy, the supreme government granted Pililla the authority to construct a church.\n\nIn 1600, the first church of cogon and bamboo was constructed in the Dolo Rio but this was burned and a church made of wood was constructed but this was also burned down with the whole town in 1632. Another church made of wood was built and this suffered the same fate in 1668. Two years later, the construction of the present church began. This was finished in 1673 and the edifice still stands up to the present.\n\nAs an autonomous town, Pililla encompassed several barrios including Tanay and Jalajala. Tanay separated from Pililla and became an independent town in 1606. Jalajala became a barrio of Pililla in 1676 but was separated and made an independent town in 1786. It was reincorporated as a barrio of Pililla in 1816, but 9 years later, it was once again separated from Pililla to become an independent municipality.\n\nOn December 4, 1837, an election of local officials was held in Pililla. The following towns participated in the said election: Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Jalajala and San Diego. The last town was a new town and is presumed to be either the barrio of Quisao, which has San Diego as its patron, or the barrio of Niogan.\n\nIn 1853, Pililla was separated from the province of Laguna to be incorporated into the newly created Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo. In 1857, it was given the new name Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong.\n\nOn March 10, 1861, two principales of San Diego presented to the government a request, on behalf of the residents of San Diego and the sitios of Mavia and Puang, that their territory be separated from Pililla and to create an independent town to be called Perez. Both the gobernadorcillo and the parish priest, as well as the gobernador politico-militar de Morong, favored the petition. However, it was disapproved by the Administracion Civil since the territory did not meet the pre-requisite of having at least 500 tributes, the said territory was having only 298 tributes at that time.\n\nOn July 9, 1885, the government received another petition from Cabeza de Barangay of San Diego requesting that it be made into a kind of self-governing barrio of Pililla, on account of its remoteness. On January 25, 1886, the government agreed to make San Diego into a \u201c''Visita con Teniente Absolute''\u201d, on condition that the barrio constructs the necessary public buildings. Thus, upon the fulfillment of the agreed condition, the government\u2019s approval went into effect on June 18 of that same year.\n\nIn 1896, the Katipuneros of Pililla and San Diego established their military camp at Rambo or Pabalang na Gubat.\n\nThree years later, on August 6, 1898, Pililla was incorporated in the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. During the existence of the Philippine Republic, San Diego became an independent town. On January 5, 1899, a fierce battle ensued between the American forces and the Filipino troops defending Pililla. The town was partially ravaged by fire and local troops had to retreat to the mountain of Tanay.\n\nThe towns of Pililla and San Diego were integrated into the newly created province of Rizal in June 1901. Two years later, the Philippine Commission, in line with its policy of economy and centralization, consolidated the towns of Pililla, San Diego and Jalajala with the seat of government in Pililla.\n\nThe first ''Capitan'' under the American regime was Regino Quitiong who was the ''alcalde'' from 1900 to 1901.\n\nOn September 20, 1907, Jalajala was separated from Pililla and became an independent municipality. Quisao, on the other hand, remained a barrio of Pililla up to the present.\n\nIn 1918, the population of Pililla was 2,776 and Quisao was 814. In 1929, the place called Longos within the jurisdiction of Pililla was cleared by the majority of the tenant population of the town of Jalajala who transferred their homes to this site and whereon they founded a new community, thus avoiding their agrarian conflict with the plantation owner of Jalajala.\n\nOn September 24, 1929, Don Ananias Vicencio, a philanthropist in public documents, donated a tract of land containing approximately 15 hectares to the families of Manuel Roxas, Leoncio Carungay and Quintin Golliden, all of Jalajala, who shall distribute and assign free of charge and to the best interest of the residents, the said lot at Longos, Barrio Quisao, Municipality of Pililla. In 1939, this land was surveyed by Engr. Quintin Gollidon who provided the layout of this new community now called Barrio Malaya.\n\nOn December 13, 1942, the town of Quisao was attacked and pillaged by \"''tulisanes''\".\n\nDuring the liberation of the town on March 18, 1945, nearly 3/4 of all the houses and public buildings were either burned or destroyed by American and Filipino military bombing and shelling. The Japanese forces and Makapili fled to the mountains following the liberation of the town. The PCAU of the US Army reestablished the municipal government of Pililla on April 20, 1945 with the designation of Lucio Aquino, an active guerrilla leader, as the mayor.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:Pililla,Rizaljf6506 11.JPG|thumb|right|Pililla Municipal Hall]]\nPililla is politically subdivided into nine [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n* Bagumbayan ([[Poblacion]])\n* Halayhayin\n* Hulo ([[Poblacion]])\n* Imatong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Malaya\n* Niogan\n* Quisao\n* Wawa ([[Poblacion]])\n* Takungan ([[Poblacion]])\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Pililla\n| 1903 = 2859\n| 1918 = 4701\n| 1939 = 5461\n| 1948 = 6067\n| 1960 = 9021\n| 1970 = 15052\n| 1975 = 18985\n| 1980 = 23222\n| 1990 = 32771\n| 1995 = 37081\n| 2000 = 45275\n| 2007 = 58525\n| 2010 = 59527\n| 2015 = 64812\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Pililla, Rizal, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=38&frmIdLgu=843 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Pililla\n | North     = [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]\n | Northeast = [[Santa Maria, Laguna]]\n | East      = [[Mabitac, Laguna]]\n | Southeast = [[Pakil, Laguna]]\n | South     = [[Jalajala, Rizal|Jalajala]]\n | West      = ''[[Laguna de Bay]]''\n}}\n{{Rizal}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Rizal]]\n[[Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Municipality in Rizal, Philippines}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name = {{PH wikidata|name}} \n| image_skyline = Pililla,Rizaljf6613 06.JPG \n| image_caption = Welcome arch\n| image_seal = Pililla Rizal.png  \n| seal_size = 100x80px\n| image_map = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption = {{PH wikidata|map_caption}}\n| image_map1 = {{Infobox mapframe|id={{#invoke:Wikibase|id}}}}\n| pushpin_map = Philippines\n| pushpin_label_position = left\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location within the {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| coordinates = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| settlement_type = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| subdivision_type = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| subdivision_type1 = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1 = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| subdivision_type2 = [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2 = {{PH wikidata|province}}\n| official_name = {{PH wikidata|official_name}}\n| etymology =  <!--origin of name-->\n| named_for =  <!--named after (if person or place)-->\n| native_name =\n| other_name =\n| motto =\n| anthem =\n| subdivision_type3 = [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|District]]\n| subdivision_name3 = [[Legislative districts of Rizal#2nd District|2nd District]]\n| established_title = Founded\n| established_date = May 5, 1583 <ref> http://www.radyoagila.com/provincial/434-years-foundation-day-ng-munisipalidad-ng-pililla-rizal-ipinagdiwang/ </ref>\n| parts_type = [[Barangay]]s\n| parts_style = para\n| p1 = 9 (see [[#Barangays|Barangays]])\n| leader_title = {{PH wikidata|leader_title}} <!--mayor-->\n| leader_name = Dan V.

In 1929, the place called Longos within the jurisdiction of Pililla was cleared by the majority of the tenant population of the town of Jalajala who transferred their homes to this site and whereon they founded a new community, thus avoiding their agrarian conflict with the plantation owner of Jalajala.\n\nOn September 24, 1929, Don Ananias Vicencio, a philanthropist in public documents, donated a tract of land containing approximately 15 hectares to the families of Manuel Roxas, Leoncio Carungay and Quintin Golliden, all of Jalajala, who shall distribute and assign free of charge and to the best interest of the residents, the said lot at Longos, Barrio Quisao, Municipality of Pililla. In 1939, this land was surveyed by Engr. Quintin Gollidon who provided the layout of this new community now called Barrio Malaya.\n\nOn December 13, 1942, the town of Quisao was attacked and pillaged by \"''tulisanes''\".\n\nDuring the liberation of the town on March 18, 1945, nearly 3/4 of all the houses and public buildings were either burned or destroyed by American and Filipino military bombing and shelling. The Japanese forces and Makapili fled to the mountains following the liberation of the town. The PCAU of the US Army reestablished the municipal government of Pililla on April 20, 1945 with the designation of Lucio Aquino, an active guerrilla leader, as the mayor.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:Pililla,Rizaljf6506 11.JPG|thumb|right|Pililla Municipal Hall]]\nPililla is politically subdivided into nine [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n* Bagumbayan ([[Poblacion]])\n* Halayhayin\n* Hulo ([[Poblacion]])\n* Imatong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Malaya\n* Niogan\n* Quisao\n* Wawa ([[Poblacion]])\n* Takungan ([[Poblacion]])\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Pililla\n| 1903 = 2859\n| 1918 = 4701\n| 1939 = 5461\n| 1948 = 6067\n| 1960 = 9021\n| 1970 = 15052\n| 1975 = 18985\n| 1980 = 23222\n| 1990 = 32771\n| 1995 = 37081\n| 2000 = 45275\n| 2007 = 58525\n| 2010 = 59527\n| 2015 = 64812\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Pililla, Rizal, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=38&frmIdLgu=843 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Pililla\n | North     = [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]\n | Northeast = [[Santa Maria, Laguna]]\n | East      = [[Mabitac, Laguna]]\n | Southeast = [[Pakil, Laguna]]\n | South     = [[Jalajala, Rizal|Jalajala]]\n | West      = ''[[Laguna de Bay]]''\n}}\n{{Rizal}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Rizal]]\n[[Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay]]\n", "name_user": "Knightwritaz95", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pililla,_Rizal"}

In the 7th century, [[Xuanzang]] tried to reverse interpret it in Sanskrit as ''Kustana''.

During the Republican era (1912\u201349), warlords and local ethnic self-determination movements wrestled over control of Xinjiang. [[Abdullah Bughra]], [[Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra]], and [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]] declared themselves Emirs of Khotan during the [[Kumul Rebellion]]. Beginning with the [[Islamic rebellion in Xinjiang (1937)|Islamic rebellion in 1937]], Hotan and the rest of the province came under the control of warlord [[Sheng Shicai]]. Sheng was later ousted by the [[Kuomintang]]. Shortly after the Communists won the civil war in 1949, Hotan was incorporated into the People's Republic of China. In 1983/4, the urban area of Hotan was administratively split from the larger [[Hotan County]], and from then on governed as a county-level city.<ref name=\"xzqhhotancity\"/><ref name=\"cihai\">{{cite book|editor1=\u590f\u5f81\u519c|editor2=\u9648\u81f3\u7acb|script-title=zh:\u8f9e\u6d77\uff1a\u7b2c\u516d\u7248\u5f69\u56fe\u672c |trans-title=[[Cihai]] (Sixth Edition in Color) |date=September 2009|location=\u4e0a\u6d77.

It serves regional flights to [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]]. Originally a military use airport, it was expanded significantly in 2002 to accommodate higher passenger volumes. It is located {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} south of the city proper.\n\n===Road===\nHotan is served by [[China National Highway 315]], which runs along the southern Tarim Basin from Ruoqiang to Kashgar, and the Trans-Taklamakan Desert Highway, which run north to Luntai. An expressway is being built between Hotan and [[Karakax County]] (Moyu) as of 2014.\n\n===Rail===\nHotan is connected to the rest of China's rail network via the [[Kashgar\u2013Hotan Railway]], which opened to freight traffic in December 2010, and passenger service in June 2011.  The railway station was constructed by a company under the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]], and is located in the town of Lasqi ({{lang|zh|\u62c9\u65af\u594e}}) northwest of the city proper.  Passenger train service on this line is limited, with only one train per day, local service 5828/5825, linking the city with Kashgar (8~ hours) and \u00dcr\u00fcmqi (~34 hours).\n\n===Buses===\nRegular bus services link Hotan with Kashgar. There is also an express bus to Aksu via the {{convert|430|km|abbr=on}} 'Hotan-Aksu Cross-Desert Highway' which was opened in 2007, travels alongside the intermittent [[Hotan River]], and which takes about 5 or 6 hours. This same bus then goes on to Urumchi taking a total of about 21 hours from Hotan.<ref>Harper et al (2009), p. 840.</ref>\n\n==Products==\n[[File:'Mutton fat' jade for sale at Khotan Jade Market.jpg|thumb|right|Light coloured or \"Mutton fat\" jade for sale at Hotan Jade Market]]\n[[File:Silk weaving in Khotan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silk]] weaving in Hotan]]\n\n===Nephrite jade===\nChinese historical sources indicate that Hotan was the main source of the [[nephrite]] jade used in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. For several hundred years, until they were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] in 176 BCE, the trade of Khotanese jade into China was controlled by the nomadic [[Yuezhi]].

Silk weaving by [[Uyghurs|Uyghur women]] is a thriving [[Putting-out system#Cottage industry|cottage industry]], some of it produced using traditional methods.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Hotan Silk Factory]] is one of the notable silk producers in Hotan.\n\n[[Silk in the Indian subcontinent#Tanchoi|Atlas]] is the fabric used for traditional Uyghur clothing worn by Uyghur women. It is soft, light and graceful tie-dyed silk fabric. It comes various colours, the brighter and rich colours are for small children to young ladies. The gray and dark colours are for elderly women.\n\nThe oldest piece of [[kilim]] which we have any knowledge was obtained by the archaeological explorer [[Aurel Stein]]; a fragment from an ancient settlement near Hotan, which was buried by sand drifts about the fourth century CE. The weave is almost identical with that of modern kilims.\n\nHotanese pile carpets are still highly prized and form an important export.<ref>Bennett, Ian. Rugs & Carpets of the World. (1978).

The town, located southeast of [[Yarkant County]] and populated almost exclusively by [[Uyghurs]], is a minor agricultural center. An important station on the southern branch of the historic [[Silk Road]], Hotan has always depended on two strong rivers\u2014the [[Karakash River]] and the [[White Jade River]] to provide the water needed to survive on the southwestern edge of the vast [[Taklamakan Desert]].

It carried the meaning of \"land of cows\". In Chinese, the same name was written as ''Yu-t'ien'', pronounced as ''Gu-dana''. The pronunciation changed over the years to Kho-tan. In the 7th century, [[Xuanzang]] tried to reverse interpret it in Sanskrit as ''Kustana''. However, the Tibetans continued to call it ''Go-sthana'', which also carried the meaning of \"land of cows\".<ref>{{citation |editor1=Bangwei Wang |editor2=Tansen Sen |title=India and China: Interactions through Buddhism and Diplomacy: A Collection of Essays by Professor Prabodh Chandra Bagchi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hrA1DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA186 |date=1 October 2011 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=978-0-85728-821-9 |page=186}}</ref><ref name=\"Puri1987\">{{citation|last=Puri|first=Baij Nath|title=Buddhism in Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sluKZfTrr3oC&pg=PA52|year=1987|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0372-5|pages=52}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{details|Kingdom of Khotan}} \n[[File:Bronze coin of Wima Kadphises found in Khotan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|Bronze coin of [[Vima Kadphises]] found in Khotan.]]\nThe oasis of Hotan is strategically located at the junction of the southern (and most ancient) branch of the [[Silk Road]] joining China and the West with one of the main routes from ancient [[India]] and [[Tibet]] to [[Central Asia]] and distant China. It provided a convenient meeting place where not only goods, but technologies, philosophies, and religions were transmitted from one culture to another.\n\n[[Tocharians]] lived in this region over 2000 years ago. Several of the [[Tarim mummies]] were found in the region. At Sampul, east of the city of Hotan, there is an extensive series of cemeteries scattered over an area about {{convert|1|km}} wide and {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} long. The excavated sites range from about 300 BCE to 100 CE. The excavated graves have produced a number of fabrics of [[felt]], [[wool]], [[silk]] and [[cotton]] and even a fine bit of tapestry, the [[Sampul tapestry]], showing the face of [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] man which was made of threads of 24 shades of colour. The tapestry had been cut up and fashioned into trousers worn by one of the deceased. An Anthropological study of 56 individuals showed a primarily Caucasoid population.<ref>Mallory, J.

An expressway is being built between Hotan and [[Karakax County]] (Moyu) as of 2014.\n\n===Rail===\nHotan is connected to the rest of China's rail network via the [[Kashgar\u2013Hotan Railway]], which opened to freight traffic in December 2010, and passenger service in June 2011.  The railway station was constructed by a company under the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]], and is located in the town of Lasqi ({{lang|zh|\u62c9\u65af\u594e}}) northwest of the city proper.

It is soft, light and graceful tie-dyed silk fabric. It comes various colours, the brighter and rich colours are for small children to young ladies. The gray and dark colours are for elderly women.\n\nThe oldest piece of [[kilim]] which we have any knowledge was obtained by the archaeological explorer [[Aurel Stein]]; a fragment from an ancient settlement near Hotan, which was buried by sand drifts about the fourth century CE.

(It therefore stands that in the setting of mental illness, whether or not the animal is a \"service animal\" vs. an emotional support animal would hinge on whether or not it is formally trained to do something specific to mitigate the mental illness.) Any animal that provides support, well-being, comfort, or aid, to an individual through companionship, unconditional positive regard, and affection may be regarded as an emotional support animal.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://dc.swosu.edu/aij/vol5/iss1/4/|title=Emotional Support Animals, Service Animals, and Pets on Campus|issue=1|last=Von Bergen|first=C.W.|date=2015|journal=Administrative Issues Journal|volume=5}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., people with emotional or mental disabilities can be exempted from certain federal housing and travel rules if they own an emotional support animal.

This [[legislative]] gap existed until 1988 when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Fair Housing Act]] Amendments.\n\n==== Fair Housing Act Amendments ====\n\nWhereas only housing authorities receiving federal financial assistance are subject to Section 504, both public and private housing authorities are subject to the provisions of the Fair Housing Act.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Enacted as part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] legislation, the Fair Housing Act (FHA) focused on [[Housing discrimination in the United States|housing discrimination]] on the basis of race, color, national origin, or gender; in 1988, however, the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments (FHAA) expanded this scope to include handicapped persons.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The FHAA states that it is unlawful \"to discriminate in the sale or rental...of a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter, a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available, or any person associated with that buyer or renter.\" Further, it is discrimination for any person to: \"refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.\" Thus, like Section 504, the FHAA requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for tenants.\n\nAdditionally, the FHAA, in section 3602(h) defines handicap, with respect to a person, as:\n# a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities;\n# a record of having such an impairment; or\n# being regarded as having such an impairment.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title = Fair Housing Act |year = 1988 |chapter = 42 |section = 3602 |subsection = (h) |wikilink = Fair Housing Act |link= http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd42usc3602.htm |source=Animal Legal & Historical Center}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"major life activities\" has been interpreted broadly to include those \"activities that are of central importance to daily life,\" such as \"seeing, hearing, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for one's self, learning, speaking, and reproducing.\"<ref name=\"Waterlander 2012\" /> The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) is responsible for administering the FHAA; the [[Attorney General]] and private individuals may enforce it.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\">{{cite journal |last= Huss |first= Rebecca J.|year= 2005 |title= No Pets Allowed: Housing Issues and Companion Animals |url=http://animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/vol11_p69.pdf |journal=Animal Law Review   |volume=11  |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo establish a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of housing discrimination under the FHAA: the tenant must have a qualifying disability, the landlord knew of the handicap or should reasonably be expected to know of it, accommodation of the handicap may be necessary to afford the tenant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling, and the landlord must deny the request, such as refusing to waive the \"no pets\" policy.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" />\n\nThe second element, that the landlord knew of the handicap or should have known of it, places an [[Legal burden of proof|affirmative burden]] on the tenant to request the reasonable accommodation, such as a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> A tenant wishing to obtain a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal may meet this burden by providing a letter from his or her physician or mental health professional:  stating that the tenant has a mental disability, explaining that the animal is needed to lessen the effects of the disability, and requesting that the animal be allowed in the rental unit as a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Landlords are entitled to ask for supporting materials which document the need for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" /> Mere emotional distress that would result from having to give up an animal because of a \"no pets\" policy will not qualify under federal law. Instead, there must be a link, or a nexus, between the animal and the disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The nexus between the animal and the disability is analyzed under the third element of an FHAA housing discrimination case, known as the necessity requirement, and requires that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled tenant's quality of life by ameliorating the effects of the disability.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> So long as the requested accommodation does not constitute an undue financial or administrative burden for the landlord, or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing, the landlord must provide the accommodation.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" />\n\nAlthough the Fair Housing Act covers both [[multi-family dwelling|multi-]] and [[single-family detached home]], the sale or rental of a single family dwelling by an owner is exempt from the statute.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> There are two exceptions to this exemption, however.

Other types of animals used by and for people with disabilities include:\n\n* [[Service animal]]s or [[assistance dog]]s:  Animals, usually dogs, that have been trained to perform specific tasks for a person with a disability.  Subtypes include:\n** [[Guide dog]]s and [[guide horse]]s:  Dogs and miniature horses that have been trained to help a blind person walk independently.\n** [[Hearing dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to identify sounds for a deaf person, such as an alarm or someone calling the person's name.\n** [[Medical response dog]]s: Dogs that have been trained to notice the onset of a medical condition, such as [[hypoglycemia]] in a person with diabetes, and to alert the handler.  \n** [[Mobility assistance dog]]s:  Typically larger dogs, mobility assistance dogs are trained to help persons who have difficulty walking, such as by pulling a wheelchair, opening doors, or letting the handlers lean on the dogs for stability and support while walking.  \n** [[Psychiatric service dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to perform specific tasks, such as entering a room to determine whether it poses any threat to the handler.  This includes [[autism service dog]]s.\n** [[Seizure response dog]]s:  Similar to medical response dogs, these dogs are trained to alert their handlers to the onset of an [[epileptic seizure]].\n* [[Therapy cat]]s and [[therapy dog]]s:  Cats or dogs that comfort people in difficult situations, such as people in [[hospice]] care.  Unlike assistance dogs, therapy animals are not usually trained to perform specific tasks, and the people they interact with may not be disabled.  Unlike emotional service animals, they are not necessarily owned by a person with a disability, but instead visit different people, who may or may not be disabled, through programs in healthcare institutions, schools, or disaster areas.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Law}}\n* [[Animal-assisted therapy]]\n* [[Reasonable accommodation]]\n* [[Service dog]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web| url= https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-assistance-animal-laws |title=Assistance Animal State Laws|website=animallaw.info |publisher=Michigan State University}} \n*{{cite web| url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures  |title=Disabilities and Medical Conditions|website=tsa.gov|publisher= TSA (Transport Security Administration}}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Assistance animals]]\n[[Category:Emotional issues]]\n", "text_old": "{{globalize|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use American English|date=March 2016}}\n\nAn '''emotional support animal''' ('''ESA''') is a type of animal that provides comfort to help relieve a symptom or effect of a person's disability.

This [[legislative]] gap existed until 1988 when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Fair Housing Act]] Amendments.\n\n==== Fair Housing Act Amendments ====\n\nWhereas only housing authorities receiving federal financial assistance are subject to Section 504, both public and private housing authorities are subject to the provisions of the Fair Housing Act.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Enacted as part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] legislation, the Fair Housing Act (FHA) focused on [[Housing discrimination in the United States|housing discrimination]] on the basis of race, color, national origin, or gender; in 1988, however, the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments (FHAA) expanded this scope to include handicapped persons.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The FHAA states that it is unlawful \"to discriminate in the sale or rental...of a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter, a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available, or any person associated with that buyer or renter.\" Further, it is discrimination for any person to: \"refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.\" Thus, like Section 504, the FHAA requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for tenants.\n\nAdditionally, the FHAA, in section 3602(h) defines handicap, with respect to a person, as:\n# a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities;\n# a record of having such an impairment; or\n# being regarded as having such an impairment.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title = Fair Housing Act |year = 1988 |chapter = 42 |section = 3602 |subsection = (h) |wikilink = Fair Housing Act |link= http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd42usc3602.htm |source=Animal Legal & Historical Center}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"major life activities\" has been interpreted broadly to include those \"activities that are of central importance to daily life,\" such as \"seeing, hearing, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for one's self, learning, speaking, and reproducing.\"<ref name=\"Waterlander 2012\" /> The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) is responsible for administering the FHAA; the [[Attorney General]] and private individuals may enforce it.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\">{{cite journal |last= Huss |first= Rebecca J.|year= 2005 |title= No Pets Allowed: Housing Issues and Companion Animals |url=http://animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/vol11_p69.pdf |journal=Animal Law Review   |volume=11  |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo establish a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of housing discrimination under the FHAA: the tenant must have a qualifying disability, the landlord knew of the handicap or should reasonably be expected to know of it, accommodation of the handicap may be necessary to afford the tenant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling, and the landlord must deny the request, such as refusing to waive the \"no pets\" policy.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" />\n\nThe second element, that the landlord knew of the handicap or should have known of it, places an [[Legal burden of proof|affirmative burden]] on the tenant to request the reasonable accommodation, such as a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> A tenant wishing to obtain a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal may meet this burden by providing a letter from his or her physician or mental health professional:  stating that the tenant has a mental disability, explaining that the animal is needed to lessen the effects of the disability, and requesting that the animal be allowed in the rental unit as a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Landlords are entitled to ask for supporting materials which document the need for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" /> Mere emotional distress that would result from having to give up an animal because of a \"no pets\" policy will not qualify under federal law. Instead, there must be a link, or a nexus, between the animal and the disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The nexus between the animal and the disability is analyzed under the third element of an FHAA housing discrimination case, known as the necessity requirement, and requires that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled tenant's quality of life by ameliorating the effects of the disability.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> So long as the requested accommodation does not constitute an undue financial or administrative burden for the landlord, or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing, the landlord must provide the accommodation.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" />\n\nAlthough the Fair Housing Act covers both [[multi-family dwelling|multi-]] and [[single-family detached home]], the sale or rental of a single family dwelling by an owner is exempt from the statute.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> There are two exceptions to this exemption, however.

Other types of animals used by and for people with disabilities include:\n\n* [[Service animal]]s or [[assistance dog]]s:  Animals, usually dogs, that have been trained to perform specific tasks for a person with a disability.  Subtypes include:\n** [[Guide dog]]s and [[guide horse]]s:  Dogs and miniature horses that have been trained to help a blind person walk independently.\n** [[Hearing dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to identify sounds for a deaf person, such as an alarm or someone calling the person's name.\n** [[Medical response dog]]s: Dogs that have been trained to notice the onset of a medical condition, such as [[hypoglycemia]] in a person with diabetes, and to alert the handler.  \n** [[Mobility assistance dog]]s:  Typically larger dogs, mobility assistance dogs are trained to help persons who have difficulty walking, such as by pulling a wheelchair, opening doors, or letting the handlers lean on the dogs for stability and support while walking.  \n** [[Psychiatric service dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to perform specific tasks, such as entering a room to determine whether it poses any threat to the handler.  This includes [[autism service dog]]s.\n** [[Seizure response dog]]s:  Similar to medical response dogs, these dogs are trained to alert their handlers to the onset of an [[epileptic seizure]].\n* [[Therapy cat]]s and [[therapy dog]]s:  Cats or dogs that comfort people in difficult situations, such as people in [[hospice]] care.  Unlike assistance dogs, therapy animals are not usually trained to perform specific tasks, and the people they interact with may not be disabled.  Unlike emotional service animals, they are not necessarily owned by a person with a disability, but instead visit different people, who may or may not be disabled, through programs in healthcare institutions, schools, or disaster areas.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Law}}\n* [[Animal-assisted therapy]]\n* [[Reasonable accommodation]]\n* [[Service dog]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web| url= https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-assistance-animal-laws |title=Assistance Animal State Laws|website=animallaw.info |publisher=Michigan State University}} \n*{{cite web| url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures  |title=Disabilities and Medical Conditions|website=tsa.gov|publisher= TSA (Transport Security Administration}}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Assistance animals]]\n[[Category:Emotional issues]]\n", "name_user": "2601:248:4400:b1b0:d048:f1a3:180:ef42", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_support_animal"}

The album is dedicated to Ralph B. Prater, who committed suicide in March 2011. It is a reminder that for every one person who makes it out alive, more will die of heartbreak.\n\n====Track listing====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The album is dedicated to Ralph B. Prater, who committed suicide in March 2011. It is a reminder that for every one person who makes it out alive, more will die of heartbreak.\n\n====Track listing====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\".
