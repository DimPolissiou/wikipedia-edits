The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholics, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

O'Connell rejected international and industrial production methods, seeking a return a smaller scale, more personalised, craft.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=20}}{{sfn|Leland|2004}} While his main inspiration for the building was early medieval architecture, a number of recently built churches in [[County Cork]] informed his choices, in particular [[Timoleague]]'s parish church and the chapel in [[Gougane Barra]].{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}}\n\n[[File:Honan interior 1.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The nave, looking west towards the main entrance]]\nThe chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=164}} Its interior has a very simple outlay,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}  consisting of four areas; the main entrance, nave, chancel and nunnery.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}} Unusually the chapel does not contain [[aisle]]s or [[transept]]s, and the six-bay rectangular [[nave]] is rather plain.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the chapel, the architecture is austere and modest.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} Functionally, the chapel lacks shrines where people could light candles or place flowers near devotional images, making it similar to a Protestant rather than Catholic church.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=25}} Its round bell-tower (''[[campanile]]'') and circular-plan are inspired by the [[Irish round tower|round towers]] found in Irish [[monastic settlement]]s from the 9th century.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} \n\nThe main entrance is on the western side, and approached via double-hinged [[wrought iron]] gates.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} The doorway is capped by three limestone [[Rib vault|ribbed]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]],{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}} supported by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] containing [[relief]]s of the heads of six [[Munster]] saints: Finnbarr of Cork, [[Colman mac Duagh|Coleman of Cloyne]]; [[St. Gobnait]] of [[Ballyvourney]]; [[Brendan]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore]] and [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} Each figure was later represented in the stained glass windows. The capitals were sculpted by Henry Emery, assisted by students at the nearby [[Cork School of Art]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}}\n\nThe [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] was designed by the sculptor [[Oliver Sheppard]], and is dominated by the figure of St. Finbarr, dressed in bishop's [[vestment]]s.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}}\n\nThe timber doorway once contained an iron grille which has since been removed. The doors hang on wrought iron strap-work hinges fashioned, according to writer Paul Larmour, in a \"Celticized art nouveau\" style{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} and were designed by the architect [[William Alphonsus Scott|William Scott]]. The doorway leads into a small oblong nave (72 x 28 feet), within a timber barrel vaulted ceiling, that ends at a square ended area around the [[chancel]] (26 x 18 feet). The [[sacristy]] is located on the left (north) side looking towards the altar, and is positioned under the bell tower.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}\n\n==Chancel==\n===Altar===\n[[File:Honan Chapel Altar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Wooden carvings, Imogen Stuart, c. 1986]]\nThe chapel has had two altars; the first having been replaced in the mid 1980s. The original altar consists of a plain slab of Irish [[limestone]], which O'Connell selected to contrast with the ornately carved Italian [[marble]] then in fashion, and which he disliked.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} The altar rested on a five legged table, each of which was lined with an [[Celtic cross|Irish crucifix]]{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}} formed from simple geometric designs. They included zig-zag patterns in [[lozenge]] and saltire, continuous dots and [[Chevron (geology)|chevron]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=55, 56}}\n\nThe chapel's design contravened the requirements of the 1962 [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II) in two aspects. Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Around them, two angles carry the sun, moon, and other symbols of creation. The lower rectangular panel, representing the doorway, shows the Adoration of the Lamb, with the lamb standing on brightly coloured altar decorated with three ringed crosses.

The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien). To the left are: St. Ita (Clarke), St. Coleman (Child), St. Brendan (Clarke), St. Gobnait (Clarke), St. Flannan (O'Brien) and St. Carthage (Rhind).{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=102, 167}}\n\n===Harry Clarke===\n[[File:Clarke St. Declan (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.23|Detail, St. Declan window]]\nIt is unlikely Clarke would have won the Honan commission if not for O'Connell's assistance.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Especially his merging of Catholic and early medieval imagery in such a modern and individualised style was at odds with prevailing trends in Irish church art.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=29}}{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}} According to scholar Luke Gibbons, freedom \"from [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] interference...enabled Clarke to exploit [[vernacular]] traditions of local saints...that belonged more to legend and [[folklore]]...and whose popular appeal lay outside the highly centralised power of post-[[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] [[Ultramontanism|Ultramontane]] Catholicism.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Clarke was in his early 20s at the time, and the windows were his first to be installed in a public space, and established his reputation as a significant international artist.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}}\n\n[[File:Harry Clarke Honan Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Detail, St. Albert window]]\nClark's windows are all single light, with each containing three registers and nine panels. The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to the subject's \"trickster\" [[Paganism|pagan]] powers\" than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.

Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family.

The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\". ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Volume 66, No. 3, 1962. {{JSTOR|501457}}</ref>The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death.

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholics, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

O'Connell rejected international and industrial production methods, seeking a return a smaller scale, more personalised, craft.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=20}}{{sfn|Leland|2004}} While his main inspiration for the building was early medieval architecture, a number of recently built churches in [[County Cork]] informed his choices, in particular [[Timoleague]]'s parish church and the chapel in [[Gougane Barra]].{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}}\n\n[[File:Honan interior 1.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The nave, looking west towards the main entrance]]\nThe chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=164}} Its interior has a very simple outlay,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}  consisting of four areas; the main entrance, nave, chancel and nunnery.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}} Unusually the chapel does not contain [[aisle]]s or [[transept]]s, and the six-bay {{sfn|NIAH|2000}} rectangular [[nave]] is rather plain.{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the chapel, the architecture is austere and modest.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} Functionally, the chapel lacks shrines where people could light candles or place flowers near devotional images, making it similar to a Protestant rather than a Catholic church.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=25}} Its round bell-tower (''[[campanile]]'') and circular-plan are inspired by the [[Irish round tower|round towers]] found in Irish [[monastic settlement]]s from the 9th century.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} \n\nThe main entrance is on the western side, and approached via double-hinged [[wrought iron]] gates.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} The doorway is capped by three limestone [[Rib vault|ribbed]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]],{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}} supported by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] containing [[relief]]s of the heads of six [[Munster]] saints: Finnbarr of Cork, [[Colman mac Duagh|Coleman of Cloyne]]; [[St. Gobnait]] of [[Ballyvourney]]; [[Brendan]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore]] and [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} Each figure was later represented in the stained glass windows. The capitals were sculpted by Henry Emery, assisted by students at the nearby [[Cork School of Art]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}}\n\nThe [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] was designed by the sculptor [[Oliver Sheppard]], and is dominated by the figure of St. Finbarr, dressed in bishop's [[vestment]]s.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}}\n\nThe timber doorway once contained an iron grille which has since been removed. The doors hang on wrought iron strap-work hinges fashioned, according to writer Paul Larmour, in a \"Celticized art nouveau\" style{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} and were designed by the architect [[William Alphonsus Scott|William Scott]]. The doorway leads into a small oblong nave (72 x 28 feet), within a timber barrel vaulted ceiling, that ends at a square ended area around the [[chancel]] (26 x 18 feet). The [[sacristy]] is located on the left (north) side looking towards the altar, and is positioned under the bell tower.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}\n\n==Chancel==\n===Altar===\n[[File:Honan Chapel Altar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Wooden carvings, Imogen Stuart, c. 1986]]\nThe chapel has had two altars; the first having been replaced in the mid 1980s. The original altar consists of a plain slab of Irish [[limestone]], which O'Connell selected to contrast with the ornately carved Italian [[marble]] then in fashion, and which he disliked.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} The altar rested on a five legged table, each of which was lined with an [[Celtic cross|Irish crucifix]]{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}} formed from simple geometric designs. They included zig-zag patterns in [[lozenge]] and saltire, continuous dots and [[Chevron (geology)|chevron]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=55, 56}}\n\nThe chapel's design contravened the requirements of the 1962 [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II) in two aspects. Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Made from carved stone, its design is reminiscent of the arched roofs and entrances to medieval Irish churches.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} Its two panels illustrate Christian themes,{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=85}} The upper, triangular, panel is set in the [[gable]] of the \"entrance\", and shows the Trinity of God the father, a dove and Jesus crucified. Around them, two angles carry the sun, moon, and other symbols of creation. The lower rectangular panel, representing the doorway, shows the Adoration of the Lamb, with the lamb standing on brightly coloured altar decorated with three ringed crosses. Two angels acting as servers kneel before him. The adoration panel is set against a background of branches and leaves attached in [[silver-gilt]].{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\nThe lower panel also shows the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, surrounded by what Teehan describes as \"the deep blue void of Heaven\".{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}} Here he is accompanied by flights of angels, bearing instruments of the passion.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} The enamel embellishments were added by the Irish craftsman and stained glass specialist Oswald Reeves,{{sfn|Larmour|1992|p=186}} and have been described as the best of his work.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\n===Pipe organ===\nThe pipe organ is located on the west wall in a timber frame.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} It was built by [[Wicklow]] native Kenneth Jones and installed in 1996.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}}\n\n==Stained glass windows==\n{{multiple image\n | align        = left\n | direction    = horizontal\n | header_align = \n | footer_align = \n | image1       = Harry Clarke (photo).jpg\n | width1       = 160\n | caption1     = Harry Clarke\n | image2       = Sarah Purser by John Butler Yeats.png\n | width2       = 138\n | caption2     = Sarah Purser\n}}\n\nThe chapel holds 19 stained glass windows. The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien). To the left are: St. Ita (Clarke), St. Coleman (Child), St. Brendan (Clarke), St. Gobnait (Clarke), St. Flannan (O'Brien) and St. Carthage (Rhind).{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=102, 167}}\n\n===Harry Clarke===\n[[File:Clarke St. Declan (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.23|Detail, St. Declan window]]\nIt is unlikely Clarke would have won the Honan commission if not for O'Connell's assistance.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Especially his merging of Catholic and early medieval imagery in such a modern and individualised style was at odds with prevailing trends in Irish church art.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=29}}{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}} According to scholar Luke Gibbons, freedom \"from [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] interference...enabled Clarke to exploit [[vernacular]] traditions of local saints...that belonged more to legend and [[folklore]]...and whose popular appeal lay outside the highly centralised power of post-[[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] [[Ultramontanism|Ultramontane]] Catholicism.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Clarke was in his early 20s at the time, and the windows were his first to be installed in a public space, and established his reputation as a significant international artist.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}}\n\n[[File:Harry Clarke Honan Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Detail, St. Albert window]]\nClark's windows are all single light, with each containing three registers and nine panels. The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to the subject's \"trickster\" [[Paganism|pagan]] powers\" than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.

Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer. It is decorated with symbols the [[zodiac]],{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}} and images based on the Christian theme of the \"River of Life\",{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|Field|2006}} as well as depictions of flora, fauna and river scenes.<ref name=\"lel\" /> The designs celebrate the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the earth, and illustrate passages from the [[Old Testament]], including the \"[[Benedicite]]\" (also known as \"A Song of Creation\") from the [[Book of Daniel]], which was [[Laudate psalms|sung]] during the [[Lauds|office of lauds]] on Sundays and [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\". ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Volume 66, No. 3, 1962. {{JSTOR|501457}}</ref>The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of the trees ([[tree of life]]) which in mythology grow in paradise and represent Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of his Christian followers.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=118}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Baker|first= R.

It was written by [[Steven Tyler]] and professional songwriters [[Richie Supa (songwriter)|Richie Supa]] and [[Glen Ballard]]. It was released as the third major single from ''[[Nine Lives (Aerosmith album)|Nine Lives]]'' in 1997.\n\n==Chart positions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe song reached No.&nbsp;27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No.&nbsp;38 in the United Kingdom, and No.&nbsp;19 in Latvia. It also topped the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for four weeks.\n\nThe band re-released the song in the United Kingdom in 1999. The re-released version did much better, reaching No.&nbsp;13.\n\n==Song structure==\nThe song is highlighted by a [[harmonica]] performance by Steven Tyler at the beginning, as well as a strong bass rhythm throughout the song, and a mix of acoustic guitars and jangling electric guitars throughout the verses.\n\nMany of the lines in the verses start with the word \"pink\" (e.g. \"Pink it's my new obsession \", \"Pink it's not even a question\", \"Pink on the lips of your lover\"). The song is also highly suggestive, in that the origin of the fascination with pink stems from the admiration of a woman's reproductive organs, particularly the inner side of the outer lips \u2013 the \"pink in the middle\" \u2013 and also the man's penis \u2013 \"I wanna wrap you in [[Condom|rubber]]\" and \"my favorite [[crayon]]\".\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] for the song used CGI to morph characters' faces to other bodies. A variety of random characters mixed in with band members moving towards the camera, morphing into different characters in the process (e.g., [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] as a [[centaur]], [[Brad Whitford]] as a little boy, Steven Tyler as a skeleton, and a boy dressed as the [[Easter Bunny]]). It was directed by [[Doug Nichol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partizan.com/partizan/musicvideos/?doug_nichol/videography|title=Doug Nichol - Videography|publisher=Partizan|accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref>\n\nTwo versions of the music video exist. In the uncensored version, there is a woman dressed in a blue jumpsuit walking towards the camera. For a brief second, the top, unzipped portion of the jumpsuit is pulled away, revealing her right breast. There is another instance where a woman's breasts are briefly fully revealed when a woman, painted blue and green, does a pirouette.\n\nThe uncensored version caused minor controversy and [[MTV]] asked Nichol to censor the video for daytime airings. As a result, the edited version censored the pirouette scene. The clean version also shows Tyler and Perry presented as a two-headed man and only the coverup portion of the breast reveal scene is present.\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n===Pink 487229===\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = Pink\n| note1           = Album Version\n| length1         = 3:55\n\n| title2          = Pink\n| note2           = South beach mix\n| length2         = 3:54\n\n| title3          = Pink\n| note3           = Live\n| length          = 3:45\n}}\n\n===Pink 753454===\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = Pink\n| note1           = Album Version\n| length1         = 3:55\n\n| title2          = [[What Kind of Love Are You On]]\n| note2           = Album Version\n| length2         = 3:16\n\n| title3          = What Kind of Love Are You On\n| note3           = Multimedia video\n}}\n\n===Pink  753423===\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = Pink\n| note1           = Album Version\n| length1         = 3:55\n\n| title2          = [[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]\n| note2           = Live at Cape Canaveral - 29.06.1998\n| length2         = 5:32\n\n| title3          = [[Hole in My Soul]]\n| note3           = Live\n| length3        = 5:35\n}}\n\n== Cover art ==\nThe 1997 release cover art had the Aerosmith logo drawn as if it were by a child, in a pink background. In the 1999 re-release, the cover art features the Aerosmith logo and eight stills from the music video.\n\nThat's the original logo.\n\n==Live in concert==\nAs of 2007, \"Pink\" is one of only two songs from ''Nine Lives'' consistently played on Aerosmith tours, along with \"[[Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)]]\".\n\n== Covers and other versions ==\nA different version of the song, The South Beach Re-Mix, was included on the career-spanning compilation ''[[O, Yeah!

It was written by [[Steven Tyler]] and professional songwriters [[Richie Supa (songwriter)|Richie Supa]] and [[Glen Ballard]]. It was released as the third major single from ''[[Nine Lives (Aerosmith album)|Nine Lives]]'' in 1997.\n\n==Chart positions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe song reached No.&nbsp;27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No.&nbsp;38 in the United Kingdom, and No.&nbsp;19 in Latvia. It also topped the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for four weeks.\n\nThe band re-released the song in the United Kingdom in 1999. The re-released version did much better, reaching No.&nbsp;13.\n\n==Song structure==\nThe song is highlighted by a [[harmonica]] performance by Steven Tyler at the beginning, as well as a strong bass rhythm throughout the song, and a mix of acoustic guitars and jangling electric guitars throughout the verses.\n\nMany of the lines in the verses start with the word \"pink\" (e.g. \"Pink it's my new obsession \", \"Pink it's not even a question\", \"Pink on the lips of your lover\"). The song is also highly suggestive, in that the origin of the fascination with pink stems from the admiration of a woman's reproductive organs, particularly the inner side of the outer lips \u2013 the \"pink in the middle\" \u2013 and also the man's penis \u2013 \"I wanna wrap you in [[Condom|rubber]]\" and \"my favorite [[crayon]]\".\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] for the song used CGI to morph characters' faces to other bodies. A variety of random characters mixed in with band members moving towards the camera, morphing into different characters in the process (e.g., [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] as a [[centaur]], [[Brad Whitford]] as a little boy, Steven Tyler as a skeleton, and a boy dressed as the [[Easter Bunny]]). It was directed by [[Doug Nichol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partizan.com/partizan/musicvideos/?doug_nichol/videography|title=Doug Nichol - Videography|publisher=Partizan|accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref>\n\nTwo versions of the music video exist. In the uncensored version, there is a woman dressed in a blue jumpsuit walking towards the camera. For a brief second, the top, unzipped portion of the jumpsuit is pulled away, revealing her right breast. There is another instance where a woman's breasts are briefly fully revealed when a woman, painted blue and green, does a pirouette.\n\nThe uncensored version caused minor controversy and [[MTV]] asked Nichol to censor the video for daytime airings. As a result, the edited version censored the pirouette scene. The clean version also shows Tyler and Perry presented as a two-headed man and only the coverup portion of the breast reveal scene is present.\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n===Pink 487229===\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = Pink\n| note1           = Album Version\n| length1         = 3:55\n\n| title2          = Pink\n| note2           = South beach mix\n| length2         = 3:54\n\n| title3          = Pink\n| note3           = Live\n| length          = 3:45\n}}\n\n===Pink 753454===\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = Pink\n| note1           = Album Version\n| length1         = 3:55\n\n| title2          = [[What Kind of Love Are You On]]\n| note2           = Album Version\n| length2         = 3:16\n\n| title3          = What Kind of Love Are You On\n| note3           = Multimedia video\n}}\n\n===Pink  753423===\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = Pink\n| note1           = Album Version\n| length1         = 3:55\n\n| title2          = [[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]\n| note2           = Live at Cape Canaveral - 29.06.1998\n| length2         = 5:32\n\n| title3          = [[Hole in My Soul]]\n| note3           = Live\n| length3        = 5:35\n}}\n\n== Cover art ==\nThe 1997 release cover art had the Aerosmith logo drawn as if it were by a child, in a pink background. In the 1999 re-release, the cover art features the Aerosmith logo and eight stills from the music video.\n\nThat\u2019s the original logo.\n\n==Live in concert==\nAs of 2007, \"Pink\" is one of only two songs from ''Nine Lives'' consistently played on Aerosmith tours, along with \"[[Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)]]\".\n\n== Covers and other versions ==\nA different version of the song, The South Beach Re-Mix, was included on the career-spanning compilation ''[[O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits]]''.\n\nJapanese edition of the \"Pink\" single from 'Nine Lives' features six tracks: three mixes of \"Pink\" (Album Version, The South Beach Mix & Live from the Howard Stern Radio Show), plus live versions of \"Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\" & \"Walk This Way\" recorded in March 1997.
