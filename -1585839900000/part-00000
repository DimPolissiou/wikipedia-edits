Operated by [[Warner Bros.]] through its Southeast Asian units, the channel is broadcast from its headquarters in [[Singapore]] to audiences in its country of location, as well as to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and Southeast Asia (except Philippines, where [[Cartoon Network (Philippines)|its broadcasting operation]] was later separated from the broader Southeast Asian version). It was launched on 6 October 1994.\n==History==\nCartoon Network started its broadcast in Asia on 6 October 1994 timesharing with TNT, also broadcasting on Australia and New Zealand. It operated from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m., with [[Turner Classic Movies]] taking the remainder of the daily schedule. From the launch of 1994, Cartoon Network was originally called TNT & Cartoon Network. On 1 July 2001, Cartoon Network Asia became a separate 24-hour channel, with exclusive local feeds. It originally aired only [[List of works produced by Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera cartoons]]. In 1996, [[MGM]] shows started airing and in 1997, [[Warner Bros.]] shows started airing. Also in 1997 the channel began airing original productions. On 22 August 1999, Cartoon Network introduced a new rebrand, introducing new bumpers, new original productions and a new graphical package. In 2000 other non-original shows were introduced. Also, throughout the early 2000s, Cartoon Network started airing several more original productions.\n\nIn 2001, a block called [[Cartoon Cartoons]] was introduced. Cartoon Network also introduced other programming blocks including Toonami, Acme Hour, Prime Time, the [[Boomerang (Australian and New Zealand TV channel)|Boomerang]] block (now a TV channel) and Cartoon Network Night Shift. In 2003 and 2004, more programming blocks were added. Early in 2004, the Boomerang network exclusively on Foxtel. Many of the older cartoons migrated to the new channel. In addition, Cartoon Network for a brief period would show segments of kids getting prizes during the holidays but this was cancelled due to low audience. Up until mid-2004, Cartoon Network had been tied with the [[Disney Channel (Southeast Asian TV channel)|Disney Channel]] as Asia's most popular family network. The removal of older 1950s-1980s Hanna-Barbera programming from the network during this period led to a fall in average audience share during 2004 as fans of older cartoons moved to Boomerang.\n\nOn 1 October 2005, the channel's '[[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]]' were replaced with [[3D film#Animation|3-D animation promotions]] that were set in a fictional location called \"CN City\". A well known scene from a show was sometimes the theme. The \"Cartoon Cartoons\" moniker was dropped in 2006. On 31 August 2008, the bumpers and ads were updated. \"Cartoon Network Theatre\" was renamed \"Cartoon Network Popcorn\". On 1 October 2011, during ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' premiere, the channel introduced a new branding, logo, and slogan. In 2013, the US CN bumpers and the Asia bumpers were refreshed.\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (Southeast Asia)}}\nA separate [[Boomerang (TV network)|TV channel]] was available in Southeast Asia from September 2005 until December 2012. It was replaced with [[Toonami (Asia)|Toonami]]; Toonami is also operated and distributed by Turner Broadcasting System Asia Pacific. However, since January 1, 2015, Boomerang has replaced Cartoonito.\n\n===Tiny TV===\nTiny TV was first shown on CN SEA in June 2002 and showed cartoon series that were targeted at very young children, such as ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'', ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', ''[[Tom & Jerry Kids]]'' and ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]''.\n\n==Availability==\n===Taiwan===\nIn [[Taiwan]], Cartoon Network was launched on 1 January 1995, it airs in [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] along with an [[English language|English]] track.\n\n===South Korea===\n{{Main|Cartoon Network (South Korean TV channel)}}\nIn January 2003, CN SEA was launched in [[South Korea]] after the discontinuation of a Cartoon Network block on [[Tooniverse]]. However, the channel was unable to insert Korean audio tracks into shows because non-South Korean channels are legally prohibited from doing so. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In 2006, [[JoongAng Ilbo]] and the Turner company established a joint venture to launch a separate South Korean version of Cartoon Network and was launched in November of the same year.\n\n===Thailand===\nIn Thailand, CN SEA is available through the [[TrueVisions]] cable and satellite networks; TrueVisions includes CN SEA in both its Gold and Platinum packages.

{"title_page": "Auditor's report", "text_new": " an independent [[external auditor]] as a result of an internal or external [[audit]], as an [[assurance services|assurance]] service in order for the user to make decisions based on the results of the audit.\n\nAn auditor's report is considered an essential tool when reporting financial information to users, particularly in business. Since many third-party users prefer, or even require financial information to be certified by an independent external auditor, many audiotapes rely on auditor reports to certify their information in order to attract investors, obtain loans, and improve public appearance. Some have even stated that financial information without an auditor's report is \"essentially worthless\" for investing purposes.<ref name=\"fundamental\">[http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/auditorsreport.asp \"Fundamental Analysis: The Auditor's Report\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127133416/http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/auditorsreport.asp |date=January 27, 2007 }} by Investopedia.com</ref>\n\n== Auditor's report on financial statements ==\n{{See also|Financial audit}}\n\nIt is important to note that auditor reports on [[financial statements]] are neither evaluations nor any other similar determination used to evaluate entities in order to make a decision. The report is only an opinion on whether the information presented is correct and free from material misstatements, whereas all other determinations are left for the user to decide.\n\nThere are four common types of auditor's reports, each one presenting a different situation encountered during the auditor's work. The four reports are as follows:\n\n=== Unqualified Opinion ===\nAn opinion is said to be '''unqualified''' when he or she does not have any significant reservation in respect of matters contained in the Financial Statements.  The most frequent type of report is referred to as the \"Unqualified Opinion\", and is regarded by many as the equivalent of a \"clean bill of health\" to a patient, which has led many to call it the \"Clean Opinion\", but in reality it is not a clean bill of health, because the Auditor can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the Financial Statements, not the health of the company itself, or the integrity of company records not part of the foundation of the Financial Statements.<ref>Accounting What The Numbers Mean, (Marshall, McManus, Viele 2008), Mc Graw Hill</ref> This type of report is issued by an auditor when the financial statements are free of material misstatements and are presented fairly in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which in other words means that the company's financial condition, position, and operations are fairly presented in the financial statements. It is the best type of report an auditee may receive from an external auditor.\n\nAn Unqualified Opinion indicates the following \u2013\n\n(1) The Financial Statements have been prepared using the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which have been consistently applied;\n\n(2) The Financial Statements comply with relevant statutory requirements and regulations;\n\n(3) There is adequate disclosure of all material matters relevant to the proper presentation of the financial information subject to statutory requirements, where applicable;\n\n(4) Any changes in the accounting principles or in the method of their application and the effects there of have been properly determined and disclosed in the Financial Statements.\n\nThe report consists of a title and header, a main body, the auditor's signature and address, and the report's issuance date. US auditing standards require that the title includes \"independent\" to convey to the user that the report was unbiased in all respects. Traditionally, the main body of the unqualified report consists of three main paragraphs, each with distinct standard wording and individual purpose. Nonetheless, certain auditors (including [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]][http://www.ibm.com/annualreport/2004/annual/roia.shtml]) have since modified the arrangement of the main body (but not the wording) in order to differentiate themselves from other audit firms, even though such modification is contrary to the clarified US AICPA standards on auditing.\n\nThe first paragraph (commonly referred to as the '''introductory paragraph''') states the audit work performed and identifies the responsibilities of the auditor and the auditee in relation to the financial statements. The second paragraph (commonly referred to as the '''scope paragraph''') details the scope of audit work, provides a general description of the nature of the work, examples of procedures performed, and any limitations the audit faced based on the nature of the work. This paragraph also states that the audit was performed in accordance with the country's prevailing generally accepted auditing standards and regulations. The third paragraph (commonly referred to as the '''opinion paragraph''') simply states the auditor's opinion on the financial statements and whether they are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.<ref name=\"fundamental\"/>\n\nThe following is an example of a standard unqualified auditor's report on financial statements as it is used in most countries, using the name ABC Company as an auditee's name.  Note that this report is acceptable only for periods ending before December 15, 2012:\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\n<div style=\"text-align:center;font-weight:bold\">INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT</div>\n\nBoard of Directors, Stockholders, Owners, and/or Management of<br />\nABC Company, Inc.<br />\n123 Main St.<br />\nAnytown, Any Country\n\n<br />\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of ABC Company, Inc.

(a California corporation), which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 20XX, and the related statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.\n\n'''Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements'''\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n'''Auditor's Responsibility'''\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n'''Opinion'''\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ABC Company, Inc. as of December 31, 20XX, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n<br />\nAUDITOR'S SIGNATURE<br />\nAuditor's name and address\n\n<br />\nDate = Last day of any significant field work\n<br/>\nThis date should not be dated earlier than when the auditor has sufficient audit evidence to support the opinion.\n</div>\n\n=== Qualified Opinion report ===\n\nQualified report is given by the auditor in either of these two cases:\n# When the financial statements are materially misstated due to misstatement in one particular account balance, class of transaction or disclosure that does not have pervasive effect on the financial statements.\n# When the auditor is unable to obtain audit evidence regarding particular account balance, class of transaction or disclosure that does not have pervasive effect on the financial statements.\n\nThe report is mostly like a Clear Opinion Report and only includes a paragraph viz. Basis for Qualification after Scope paragraph and before Opinion paragraph. Opinion paragraph in addition to its standard wording includes \u201cexcept for the matter described in Basis for Qualification paragraph the financial statements give true and fair view.\u201d\n\nDetailed below:\n\nA '''Qualified Opinion''' report is issued when the auditor encountered one of the two types of situations which do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, however the rest of the financial statements are fairly presented. This type of opinion is very similar to an unqualified or \"clean opinion\", but the report states that the financial statements are fairly presented with a certain exception which is otherwise misstated. The two types of situations which would cause an auditor to issue this opinion over the Unqualified opinion are:\n\n* Single deviation from GAAP \u2013 this type of qualification occurs when one or more areas of the financial statements do not conform with GAAP (e.g. are misstated), but do not affect the rest of the financial statements from being fairly presented when taken as a whole. Examples of this include a company dedicated to a retail business that did not correctly calculate the depreciation expense of its building. Even if this expense is considered material, since the rest of the financial statements do conform with GAAP, then the auditor qualifies the opinion by describing the depreciation misstatement in the report and continues to issue a clean opinion on the rest of the financial statements.\n* Limitation of scope \u2013 this type of qualification occurs when the auditor could not audit one or more areas of the financial statements, and although they could not be verified, the rest of the financial statements were audited and they conform to GAAP. Examples of this include an auditor not being able to observe and test a company's inventory of goods. If the auditor audited the rest of the financial statements and is reasonably sure that they conform with GAAP, then the auditor simply states that the financial statements are fairly presented, with the exception of the inventory which could not be audited.\n\nThe wording of the qualified report is very similar to the Unqualified opinion, but an '''explanatory paragraph''' is added to explain the reasons for the qualification after the scope paragraph but before the opinion paragraph. The introductory paragraph is left exactly the same as in the unqualified opinion, while the scope and the opinion paragraphs receive a slight modification in line with the qualification in the explanatory paragraph.\n\nThe scope paragraph is edited to include the following phrase in the first sentence, so that the user may be immediately aware of the qualification. This placement also informs the user that, except for the qualification, the rest of the audit was performed without qualifications:\n\n:\"''Except as discussed in the following paragraph,'' we conducted our audit...\"\n\nThe opinion paragraph is also edited to include an additional phrase in the first sentence, so that the user is reminded that the auditor's opinion explicitly excludes the qualification expressed. Depending on the type of qualification, the phrase is edited to either state the qualification and the adjustments needed to correct it, or state the [[scope limitation]] and that adjustments could have but not necessarily been required in order to correct it.\n\nFor a qualification arising from a deviation from GAAP, the following phrase is added to the opinion paragraph, using the depreciation example mentioned above:\n:\"In our opinion, ''except for the effects of the Company's incorrect determination of depreciation expense,'' the financial statement referred to in the first paragraph presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\u2026\"\n\nFor a qualification arising from a [[scope of limitation]], the following phrase is added to the opinion paragraph, using the inventory example mentioned above:\n\n:\"In our opinion, ''except for the effects of such adjustments, if any, as might have been determined to be necessary had we been able to perform proper tests and procedures on the Company's inventory,'' the financial statement referred to in the first paragraph presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\u2026\n\n=== Adverse Opinion report ===\nAn '''Adverse Opinion Report''' is issued on the financial statements of a company when the financial statements are materially misstated and such misstatements have pervasive effect on the financial statements.\n\nAn '''Adverse Opinion''' is issued when the auditor determines that the financial statements of an auditee are materially misstated and, when considered as a whole,    do not conform with GAAP. It is considered the opposite of an unqualified or clean opinion, essentially stating that the information contained is materially incorrect, unreliable, and inaccurate in order to assess the auditee's financial position and results of operations. Investors, lending institutions, and governments very rarely accept an auditee's financial statements if the auditor issued an adverse opinion, and usually request the auditee to correct the financial statements and obtain another audit report.\n\nGenerally, an adverse opinion is only given if the financial statements pervasively differ from GAAP.<ref>Auditing & Assurance Services: A systematic approach.  Messier, W and C. Emby. McGraw-Hill Ryerson Limited, 2005.</ref>  An example of such a situation would be failure of a company to consolidate a material subsidiary.\n\nThe wording of the adverse report is similar to the qualified report. The scope paragraph is modified accordingly and an explanatory paragraph is added to explain the reason for the adverse opinion after the scope paragraph but before the opinion paragraph. However, the most significant change in the adverse report from the qualified report is in the opinion paragraph, where the auditor clearly states that the financial statements are not in accordance with GAAP, which means that they, as a whole, are unreliable, inaccurate, and do not present a fair view of the auditee's position and operations.\n\n:\"In our opinion, ''because of the situations mentioned above'' (in the explanatory paragraph), the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph ''do not'' present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\u2026\"\n\n=== Disclaimer of Opinion report ===\nA '''Disclaimer of Opinion''' is issued in either of the following cases:\n* When the auditor is not independent or when there is conflict of interest.\n* When the limitation on scope is imposed by client, as a result the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.\n* When there are significant uncertainties in the business of client.\n\nThe audit report changes significantly when there is Disclaimer of opinion. An additional paragraph \"Basis for Disclaimer\" is added in audit report which is placed after Scope paragraph and before Opinion paragraph. In Scope paragraph the wording changes to \"We were engaged to audit the financial statements of XYZ Co. Ltd.\" from \"We have audited the financial statements of XYZ Co. Ltd.\"\nIn Opinion paragraph wording changes to \"We do not express an opinion on the financial statements of XYZ Co. Ltd. due to situations explained in Basis for Disclaimer paragraph\"\n\nA '''Disclaimer of Opinion''', commonly referred to simply as a '''Disclaimer''', is issued when the auditor could not form and consequently refuses to present an opinion on the financial statements. This type of report is issued when the auditor tried to audit an entity but could not complete the work due to various reasons and does not issue an opinion. The disclaimer of opinion report can be traced back to 1949, when the Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 23: ''Recommendation Made To Clarify Accountant's Representations When Opinion Is Not Expressed'' was published in order to provide guidance to auditors in presenting a disclaimer.<ref name=\"using_disclaimers\">[http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/404/essentials/p26.htm \"Using Disclaimers in Audit Reports: Discerning Between Shades of Opinion\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302205611/http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/404/essentials/p26.htm |date=2007-03-02 }} by Robert R. Davis, [[CPA Journal]], 2004, retrieved on January 24, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Statements on Auditing Standards]] (SAS) provide certain situations where a disclaimer of opinion may be appropriate:\n\n* A lack of independence, or material conflict(s) of interest, exist between the auditor and the auditee (SAS No. 26)\n* There are significant scope limitations, whether intentional or not, which hinder the auditor's work in obtaining evidence and performing procedures (SAS No. 58);\n* There is a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a [[going concern]] or, in other words, continue operating (SAS No. 59)\n* There are significant uncertainties within the auditee (SAS No. 79).\n\nAlthough this type of opinion is rarely used,<ref name=\"using_disclaimers\"/> the most common examples where disclaimers are issued include audits where the auditee willfully hides or refuses to provide evidence and information to the auditor in significant areas of the financial statements, where the auditee is facing significant legal and litigation issues in which the outcome is uncertain (usually government investigations), and where the auditee has [[going concern]] issues (the auditee may not continue operating in the near future).<ref name=\"using_disclaimers\"/> Investors, lending institutions, and governments typically reject an auditee's financial statements if the auditor disclaimed an opinion, and will request the auditee to correct the situations the auditor mentioned and obtain another audit report.\n\nA disclaimer of opinion differs substantially from the rest of the auditor's reports because it provides very little information regarding the audit itself, and includes an explanatory paragraph stating the reasons for the disclaimer. Although the report still contains the letterhead, the auditee's name and address, the auditor's signature and address, and the report's issuance date, every other paragraph is modified extensively, and the scope paragraph is entirely omitted since the auditor is basically stating that an audit could not be realized.\n\nIn the introductory paragraph, the first phrase changes from \"We have audited\" to \"We were engaged to audit\" in order to let the user know that the auditee commissioned an audit, but does not mention that the auditor necessarily completed the audit. Additionally, since the audit was not completely and/or adequately performed, the auditor refuses to accept any responsibility by omitting the last sentence of the paragraph. The scope paragraph is omitted in its entirety since, effectively, no audit was performed. Similar to the qualified and the adverse opinions, the auditor must briefly discuss the situations for the disclaimer in an explanatory paragraph. Finally, the opinion paragraph changes completely, stating that an opinion could not be formed and is not expressed because of the situations mentioned in the previous paragraphs.\n\nThe following is a draft of the three main paragraphs of a disclaimer of opinion because of inadequate [[accounting records]] of an auditee, which is considered a significant scope of limitation:\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\nWe ''were engaged to audit'' the accompanying balance sheet of ABC Company, Inc. (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 20XX and the related statements of income and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.\n\n<br />\n''The Company does not maintain adequate accounting records to provide sufficient information for the preparation of the basic financial statements. The Company's accounting records do not constitute a  [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry system]] which can produce financial statements.''\n\n<br />\nBecause of the significance of the matters discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion of the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph.\n</div>\n\n=== Auditor's report on internal controls of public companies ===\n{{see also|Sarbanes-Oxley Act }}\n\nFollowing the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) was established in order to monitor, regulate, inspect, and discipline audit and public accounting firms of public companies. The PCAOB [https://web.archive.org/web/20070126104457/http://www.pcaobus.org/Standards/Standards_and_Related_Rules/Auditing_Standard_No.2.aspx Auditing Standards No. 2] now requires auditors of public companies to include an additional disclosure in the opinion report regarding the auditee's internal controls, and to opine about the company's and auditor's assessment on the company's internal controls over financial reporting. These new requirements are commonly referred to as the '''COSO Opinion'''.\n\nThe auditor's report is modified to include all necessary disclosures by either presenting the report subsequent to the report on the financial statements, or combining both reports into one auditor's report. The following is an example of the former version of adding a separate report immediately after the auditor's report on financial statements.\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\n<br />\n'''Internal control over financial reporting'''\n\n<br />\nWe have also audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20XX, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (\"COSO\").The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n<br />\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n<br />\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<br />\nIn our opinion, management's assessment that ABC Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20XX, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Furthermore, in our opinion, ABC Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20XX, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\n</div>\n\n=== Going concern ===\n[[Going concern]] is a term [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goingconcern.asp] which means that an entity will continue to operate in the near future which is generally more than next 12 months, so long as it generates or obtains enough resources to operate. If the auditee is not a going concern, it means that the entity might not be able to sustain itself within the next twelve months.  Auditors are required to consider the going concern of an auditee before issuing a report.<ref name=\"going_concern\">[http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/504/essentials/p40.htm ''The Going-Concern Assumption Revisited: Assessing a Company's Future Viability''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308120230/http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/504/essentials/p40.htm |date=2007-03-08 }} by Elizabeth K. Venuti, CPA, PhD; The CPA Journal; 2004; retrieved January 16, 2007</ref> If the auditee is a going concern, the auditor does not modify his/her report in any way. However, if the auditor considers that the auditee is not a going concern, or will not be a going concern in the near future, then the auditor is required to include an explanatory paragraph before the opinion paragraph or following the opinion papragraph, in the audit report explaining the situation,<ref name=\"going_concern\"/><ref name=\"SAS_59\">Statement on Auditing Standards No. 59: ''The Auditor's Consideration of an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern'', issued by the Auditing Standards Board</ref> which is commonly referred to as the '''going concern disclosure'''. Such an opinion is called an \"unqualified modified opinion\".\n\nUnfortunately, many auditors are increasingly reluctant to include this disclosure in their opinions, since it is considered a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" by some.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> This is because a disclosure for a lack of going concern is viewed negatively by investors, lending institutions, and credit agencies, and therefore reduces the chance that the auditee may obtain the capital or borrowing it needs to survive once the disclosure is made. If this situation occurs, the auditee is more likely to stop being a going concern while the auditor loses potential future audit engagements, and so the auditor may be pressured to avoid including a going concern disclosure. In a study performed on 2001 bankruptcies, nearly half (48%) of selected public companies who faced bankruptcy in 2001 did not have a \"going concern disclosure\" in the previous auditor's reports.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> Additionally, 12 of the 20 largest bankruptcies in U.S. history occurred between 2001 and 2002 and none of them had a \"going concern disclosure\" in their previous auditor's report.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/>\n\nAs for the actual wording of the auditor's report, when a lack of going concern is determined by the auditor, the disclosure paragraph should state the situation, state the auditor's determination, and state the auditee's plan to correct the situation. The disclosure paragraph should immediately follow the opinion paragraph.\n\nThe following is the most widely used format of the paragraph which, in this case, deals with a company that has recurring losses:<ref name=\"PPC_GC\">PPC's Guide to Auditor's Reports, Thomson Publishing Group, Vol. 1, Chapter 6:Uncertainties, Section 606: Going Concern Problems</ref>\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note (X) to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses and has a net capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note (X). The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n</div>\n\n=== Other explanatory information and paragraphs ===\nAlthough the auditor reports mentioned above are the standard reports for financial statement audits, the auditor may add additional information to the report if it is deemed necessary without changing the overall opinion of the report. Usually, this additional information is included after the opinion paragraph, although some situations require that the additional information be included in paragraphs before the opinion paragraph. The most frequent paragraphs include:\n\n* Limiting distribution of the report \u2013 In some occasions, the audit report is restricted to a specified user and the auditor includes this restriction in the report, such as a report for financial statements made in cash basis which are prepared for tax purposes only, financial statements for a wholly owned subsidiary whose sole user of its financial statements is its parent company, etc.\n* Additional or supplemental information \u2013 Certain auditees include additional and/or supplemental information with their financial statements which is not directly related to the financial statements. Examples due to size, time, location, and/or technical constraints. When the main auditor has to rely on another auditor's work, the main auditor may either accept responsibility for the component's information and not modify the audit report, or may choose to disclaim the audit on the specific component, stating that the main auditor did not audit the component, that another auditor audited the component, that the component's audited information is therefore the responsibility of another auditor, and that the main auditor is simply including it in the original auditee's information. If used, this disclaimer is usually included in the introductory paragraph.\n\n=== Auditor's reports on financial statements in different countries ===\n{{See also|International Standards on Auditing}}\n\nThe auditor's report usually does not vary from country to country, although some countries do require either additional or less wording. In the United States, auditors are required to include in the scope paragraphs a phrase stating that they conducted their audit \"in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of America\", and, in the opinion paragraph, state whether the financial statements are presented \"in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\". Some countries, such as the [[Philippines]], use similar reports to those issued in the United States, with the exception that second paragraph would state that the audit was conducted in accordance with Philippine Standards on Auditing, and that the financial statements are in accordance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards.\n\n== Opinion shopping ==\n'''Opinion shopping''' is a term used by external auditors and, after the [[Enron]] and [[Arthur Andersen]] [[accounting scandals]], the media and general public refer to auditees who contract or reject auditors based on the type of opinion report they will issue on the auditee.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> The underlying principles of this concept are that auditees determine the compensation to auditors for their work (called \"audit fees\") as well as awarding future audit engagements; that such fees are the auditor's main source of income; that certain auditees may try to contract auditors that will issue audit opinions based on the auditees' needs; and that certain auditors are willing to comply with such demands so long as they are assured future audit engagements.\n\nThe most common example is an auditee that knows that the current auditor is going to issue a qualified, adverse, or disclaimer of opinion report, who then rescinds the audit engagement before the opinion is issued, and subsequently \"shops\" for another auditor who is willing to issue an \"unqualified\" opinion, regardless of any qualifying situations mentioned in the previous sections. However, opinion shopping is not limited to auditees contracting auditors based on issuing opinions. It also includes auditors who are over-pleasing to auditees by issuing unqualified reports without properly auditing, or by simply overlooking material issues affecting the audit. These auditors' objective is to appear much more attractive and easy-going than other auditors in order to secure future audit engagements and fees.\n\nAlthough the great majority of auditors are not willing to jeopardize their profession and reputation for guaranteed audit fees, there are some that will issue opinions solely based on obtaining or maintaining audit engagements. This includes auditors who knowingly emit unmodified unqualified opinions for auditees who are engaged in illegal activities, auditees who have caused a material limitation of scope, auditees that have a lack of going concern,<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> or auditees who present fraudulent financial statements (e.g. Enron and Arthur Andersen). This situation is a clear conflict of interest which should hinder an auditor's independence and the ability to audit (AICPA Code of Ethics), but some auditors willingly ignore this statute.\n\nRecent laws and industry standards have been implemented in order to correct this situation, which include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the AICPA's practice-monitoring program and Peer Review Program, which are in some cases voluntary, and in other cases, required.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/PeerReview/Resources/FAQs/DownloadableDocuments/qandaprp.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521221333/http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/PeerReview/Resources/FAQs/DownloadableDocuments/qandaprp.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Other engagements and reports ==\nThere are various other audits and evaluations which an external auditor performs in addition to the engagements mentioned in the previous sections, each with their respective standard report(s):\n\n* Certification audit reports (for example, an [[ISO 9000]] audit report)\n* Compilations (not an audit, but requires a report)\n* [[Due Diligence]]\n* [[Environmental audit]] report\n* [[Financial forecast]]s\n* Filing of a public company's [[Form 10-Q]] and [[Form 10-K]]\n* Agreed Upon Procedures\n* [[Internal audit]] reports\n* Regulatory inspection reports\n* Review of [[financial statement]]s (an overview with very limited auditing procedures)\n* [[Fraud]] & Materiality Memo\n* [[Second opinion]]\n* [[XBRL assurance]]\n* [[Information security audit]]  [[information technology audit]] or [[information technology security audit]]\n\n=== Report to the audit committee or board ===\nThe auditor's report on the financial statements typically provides very limited details on the procedures and findings of the audit.

Since many third-party users prefer, or even require financial information to be certified by an independent external auditor, many audiotapes rely on auditor reports to certify their information in order to attract investors, obtain loans, and improve public appearance. Some have even stated that financial information without an auditor's report is \"essentially worthless\" for investing purposes.<ref name=\"fundamental\">[http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/auditorsreport.asp \"Fundamental Analysis: The Auditor's Report\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127133416/http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/auditorsreport.asp |date=January 27, 2007 }} by Investopedia.com</ref>\n\n== Auditor's report on financial statements ==\n{{See also|Financial audit}}\n\nIt is important to note that auditor reports on [[financial statements]] are neither evaluations nor any other similar determination used to evaluate entities in order to make a decision. The report is only an opinion on whether the information presented is correct and free from material misstatements, whereas all other determinations are left for the user to decide.\n\nThere are four common types of auditor's reports, each one presenting a different situation encountered during the auditor's work. The four reports are as follows:\n\n=== Unqualified Opinion ===\nAn opinion is said to be '''unqualified''' when he or she does not have any significant reservation in respect of matters contained in the Financial Statements.  The most frequent type of report is referred to as the \"Unqualified Opinion\", and is regarded by many as the equivalent of a \"clean bill of health\" to a patient, which has led many to call it the \"Clean Opinion\", but in reality it is not a clean bill of health, because the Auditor can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the Financial Statements, not the health of the company itself, or the integrity of company records not part of the foundation of the Financial Statements.<ref>Accounting What The Numbers Mean, (Marshall, McManus, Viele 2008), Mc Graw Hill</ref> This type of report is issued by an auditor when the financial statements are free of material misstatements and are presented fairly in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which in other words means that the company's financial condition, position, and operations are fairly presented in the financial statements. It is the best type of report an auditee may receive from an external auditor.\n\nAn Unqualified Opinion indicates the following \u2013\n\n(1) The Financial Statements have been prepared using the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which have been consistently applied;\n\n(2) The Financial Statements comply with relevant statutory requirements and regulations;\n\n(3) There is adequate disclosure of all material matters relevant to the proper presentation of the financial information subject to statutory requirements, where applicable;\n\n(4) Any changes in the accounting principles or in the method of their application and the effects there of have been properly determined and disclosed in the Financial Statements.\n\nThe report consists of a title and header, a main body, the auditor's signature and address, and the report's issuance date. US auditing standards require that the title includes \"independent\" to convey to the user that the report was unbiased in all respects. Traditionally, the main body of the unqualified report consists of three main paragraphs, each with distinct standard wording and individual purpose. Nonetheless, certain auditors (including [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]][http://www.ibm.com/annualreport/2004/annual/roia.shtml]) have since modified the arrangement of the main body (but not the wording) in order to differentiate themselves from other audit firms, even though such modification is contrary to the clarified US AICPA standards on auditing.\n\nThe first paragraph (commonly referred to as the '''introductory paragraph''') states the audit work performed and identifies the responsibilities of the auditor and the auditee in relation to the financial statements. The second paragraph (commonly referred to as the '''scope paragraph''') details the scope of audit work, provides a general description of the nature of the work, examples of procedures performed, and any limitations the audit faced based on the nature of the work. This paragraph also states that the audit was performed in accordance with the country's prevailing generally accepted auditing standards and regulations. The third paragraph (commonly referred to as the '''opinion paragraph''') simply states the auditor's opinion on the financial statements and whether they are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.<ref name=\"fundamental\"/>\n\nThe following is an example of a standard unqualified auditor's report on financial statements as it is used in most countries, using the name ABC Company as an auditee's name.  Note that this report is acceptable only for periods ending before December 15, 2012:\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\n<div style=\"text-align:center;font-weight:bold\">INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT</div>\n\nBoard of Directors, Stockholders, Owners, and/or Management of<br />\nABC Company, Inc.<br />\n123 Main St.<br />\nAnytown, Any Country\n\n<br />\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of ABC Company, Inc.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.\n\n<br />\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in (the country where the report is issued). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

(a California corporation), which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 20XX, and the related statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.\n\n'''Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements'''\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n'''Auditor's Responsibility'''\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n'''Opinion'''\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ABC Company, Inc. as of December 31, 20XX, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n<br />\nAUDITOR'S SIGNATURE<br />\nAuditor's name and address\n\n<br />\nDate = Last day of any significant field work\n<br/>\nThis date should not be dated earlier than when the auditor has sufficient audit evidence to support the opinion.\n</div>\n\n=== Qualified Opinion report ===\n\nQualified report is given by the auditor in either of these two cases:\n# When the financial statements are materially misstated due to misstatement in one particular account balance, class of transaction or disclosure that does not have pervasive effect on the financial statements.\n# When the auditor is unable to obtain audit evidence regarding particular account balance, class of transaction or disclosure that does not have pervasive effect on the financial statements.\n\nThe report is mostly like a Clear Opinion Report and only includes a paragraph viz. Basis for Qualification after Scope paragraph and before Opinion paragraph. Opinion paragraph in addition to its standard wording includes \u201cexcept for the matter described in Basis for Qualification paragraph the financial statements give true and fair view.\u201d\n\nDetailed below:\n\nA '''Qualified Opinion''' report is issued when the auditor encountered one of the two types of situations which do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, however the rest of the financial statements are fairly presented. This type of opinion is very similar to an unqualified or \"clean opinion\", but the report states that the financial statements are fairly presented with a certain exception which is otherwise misstated. The two types of situations which would cause an auditor to issue this opinion over the Unqualified opinion are:\n\n* Single deviation from GAAP \u2013 this type of qualification occurs when one or more areas of the financial statements do not conform with GAAP (e.g. are misstated), but do not affect the rest of the financial statements from being fairly presented when taken as a whole. Examples of this include a company dedicated to a retail business that did not correctly calculate the depreciation expense of its building. Even if this expense is considered material, since the rest of the financial statements do conform with GAAP, then the auditor qualifies the opinion by describing the depreciation misstatement in the report and continues to issue a clean opinion on the rest of the financial statements.\n* Limitation of scope \u2013 this type of qualification occurs when the auditor could not audit one or more areas of the financial statements, and although they could not be verified, the rest of the financial statements were audited and they conform to GAAP. Examples of this include an auditor not being able to observe and test a company's inventory of goods. If the auditor audited the rest of the financial statements and is reasonably sure that they conform with GAAP, then the auditor simply states that the financial statements are fairly presented, with the exception of the inventory which could not be audited.\n\nThe wording of the qualified report is very similar to the Unqualified opinion, but an '''explanatory paragraph''' is added to explain the reasons for the qualification after the scope paragraph but before the opinion paragraph. The introductory paragraph is left exactly the same as in the unqualified opinion, while the scope and the opinion paragraphs receive a slight modification in line with the qualification in the explanatory paragraph.\n\nThe scope paragraph is edited to include the following phrase in the first sentence, so that the user may be immediately aware of the qualification. This placement also informs the user that, except for the qualification, the rest of the audit was performed without qualifications:\n\n:\"''Except as discussed in the following paragraph,'' we conducted our audit...\"\n\nThe opinion paragraph is also edited to include an additional phrase in the first sentence, so that the user is reminded that the auditor's opinion explicitly excludes the qualification expressed. Depending on the type of qualification, the phrase is edited to either state the qualification and the adjustments needed to correct it, or state the [[scope limitation]] and that adjustments could have but not necessarily been required in order to correct it.\n\nFor a qualification arising from a deviation from GAAP, the following phrase is added to the opinion paragraph, using the depreciation example mentioned above:\n:\"In our opinion, ''except for the effects of the Company's incorrect determination of depreciation expense,'' the financial statement referred to in the first paragraph presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\u2026\"\n\nFor a qualification arising from a [[scope of limitation]], the following phrase is added to the opinion paragraph, using the inventory example mentioned above:\n\n:\"In our opinion, ''except for the effects of such adjustments, if any, as might have been determined to be necessary had we been able to perform proper tests and procedures on the Company's inventory,'' the financial statement referred to in the first paragraph presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\u2026\n\n=== Adverse Opinion report ===\nAn '''Adverse Opinion Report''' is issued on the financial statements of a company when the financial statements are materially misstated and such misstatements have pervasive effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nAn '''Adverse Opinion''' is issued when the auditor determines that the financial statements of an auditee are materially misstated and, when considered as a whole,    do not conform with GAAP. It is considered the opposite of an unqualified or clean opinion, essentially stating that the information contained is materially incorrect, unreliable, and inaccurate in order to assess the auditee's financial position and results of operations. Investors, lending institutions, and governments very rarely accept an auditee's financial statements if the auditor issued an adverse opinion, and usually request the auditee to correct the financial statements and obtain another audit report.\n\nGenerally, an adverse opinion is only given if the financial statements pervasively differ from GAAP.<ref>Auditing & Assurance Services: A systematic approach.  Messier, W and C. Emby. McGraw-Hill Ryerson Limited, 2005.</ref>  An example of such a situation would be failure of a company to consolidate a material subsidiary.\n\nThe wording of the adverse report is similar to the qualified report. The scope paragraph is modified accordingly and an explanatory paragraph is added to explain the reason for the adverse opinion after the scope paragraph but before the opinion paragraph. However, the most significant change in the adverse report from the qualified report is in the opinion paragraph, where the auditor clearly states that the financial statements are not in accordance with GAAP, which means that they, as a whole, are unreliable, inaccurate, and do not present a fair view of the auditee's position and operations.\n\n:\"In our opinion, ''because of the situations mentioned above'' (in the explanatory paragraph), the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph ''do not'' present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\u2026\"\n\n=== Disclaimer of Opinion report ===\nA '''Disclaimer of Opinion''' is issued in either of the following cases:\n* When the auditor is not independent or when there is conflict of interest.\n* When the limitation on scope is imposed by client, as a result the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.\n* When there are significant uncertainties in the business of client.\n\nThe audit report changes significantly when there is Disclaimer of opinion. An additional paragraph \"Basis for Disclaimer\" is added in audit report which is placed after Scope paragraph and before Opinion paragraph. In Scope paragraph the wording changes to \"We were engaged to audit the financial statements of XYZ Co. Ltd.\" from \"We have audited the financial statements of XYZ Co. Ltd.\"\nIn Opinion paragraph wording changes to \"We do not express an opinion on the financial statements of XYZ Co. Ltd. due to situations explained in Basis for Disclaimer paragraph\"\n\nA '''Disclaimer of Opinion''', commonly referred to simply as a '''Disclaimer''', is issued when the auditor could not form and consequently refuses to present an opinion on the financial statements. This type of report is issued when the auditor tried to audit an entity but could not complete the work due to various reasons and does not issue an opinion. The disclaimer of opinion report can be traced back to 1949, when the Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 23: ''Recommendation Made To Clarify Accountant's Representations When Opinion Is Not Expressed'' was published in order to provide guidance to auditors in presenting a disclaimer.<ref name=\"using_disclaimers\">[http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/404/essentials/p26.htm \"Using Disclaimers in Audit Reports: Discerning Between Shades of Opinion\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302205611/http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/404/essentials/p26.htm |date=2007-03-02 }} by Robert R. Davis, [[CPA Journal]], 2004, retrieved on January 24, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Statements on Auditing Standards]] (SAS) provide certain situations where a disclaimer of opinion may be appropriate:\n\n* A lack of independence, or material conflict(s) of interest, exist between the auditor and the auditee (SAS No. 26)\n* There are significant scope limitations, whether intentional or not, which hinder the auditor's work in obtaining evidence and performing procedures (SAS No. 58);\n* There is a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a [[going concern]] or, in other words, continue operating (SAS No. 59)\n* There are significant uncertainties within the auditee (SAS No. 79).\n\nAlthough this type of opinion is rarely used,<ref name=\"using_disclaimers\"/> the most common examples where disclaimers are issued include audits where the auditee willfully hides or refuses to provide evidence and information to the auditor in significant areas of the financial statements, where the auditee is facing significant legal and litigation issues in which the outcome is uncertain (usually government investigations), and where the auditee has [[going concern]] issues (the auditee may not continue operating in the near future).<ref name=\"using_disclaimers\"/> Investors, lending institutions, and governments typically reject an auditee's financial statements if the auditor disclaimed an opinion, and will request the auditee to correct the situations the auditor mentioned and obtain another audit report.\n\nA disclaimer of opinion differs substantially from the rest of the auditor's reports because it provides very little information regarding the audit itself, and includes an explanatory paragraph stating the reasons for the disclaimer. Although the report still contains the letterhead, the auditee's name and address, the auditor's signature and address, and the report's issuance date, every other paragraph is modified extensively, and the scope paragraph is entirely omitted since the auditor is basically stating that an audit could not be realized.\n\nIn the introductory paragraph, the first phrase changes from \"We have audited\" to \"We were engaged to audit\" in order to let the user know that the auditee commissioned an audit, but does not mention that the auditor necessarily completed the audit. Additionally, since the audit was not completely and/or adequately performed, the auditor refuses to accept any responsibility by omitting the last sentence of the paragraph. The scope paragraph is omitted in its entirety since, effectively, no audit was performed. Similar to the qualified and the adverse opinions, the auditor must briefly discuss the situations for the disclaimer in an explanatory paragraph. Finally, the opinion paragraph changes completely, stating that an opinion could not be formed and is not expressed because of the situations mentioned in the previous paragraphs.\n\nThe following is a draft of the three main paragraphs of a disclaimer of opinion because of inadequate [[accounting records]] of an auditee, which is considered a significant scope of limitation:\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\nWe ''were engaged to audit'' the accompanying balance sheet of ABC Company, Inc. (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 20XX and the related statements of income and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.\n\n<br />\n''The Company does not maintain adequate accounting records to provide sufficient information for the preparation of the basic financial statements. The Company's accounting records do not constitute a  [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry system]] which can produce financial statements.''\n\n<br />\nBecause of the significance of the matters discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion of the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph.\n</div>\n\n=== Auditor's report on internal controls of public companies ===\n{{see also|Sarbanes-Oxley Act }}\n\nFollowing the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) was established in order to monitor, regulate, inspect, and discipline audit and public accounting firms of public companies. The PCAOB [https://web.archive.org/web/20070126104457/http://www.pcaobus.org/Standards/Standards_and_Related_Rules/Auditing_Standard_No.2.aspx Auditing Standards No. 2] now requires auditors of public companies to include an additional disclosure in the opinion report regarding the auditee's internal controls, and to opine about the company's and auditor's assessment on the company's internal controls over financial reporting. These new requirements are commonly referred to as the '''COSO Opinion'''.\n\nThe auditor's report is modified to include all necessary disclosures by either presenting the report subsequent to the report on the financial statements, or combining both reports into one auditor's report. The following is an example of the former version of adding a separate report immediately after the auditor's report on financial statements.\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\n<br />\n'''Internal control over financial reporting'''\n\n<br />\nWe have also audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20XX, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (\"COSO\").The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n<br />\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n<br />\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<br />\nIn our opinion, management's assessment that ABC Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20XX, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Furthermore, in our opinion, ABC Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20XX, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\n</div>\n\n=== Going concern ===\n[[Going concern]] is a term [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goingconcern.asp] which means that an entity will continue to operate in the near future which is generally more than next 12 months, so long as it generates or obtains enough resources to operate. If the auditee is not a going concern, it means that the entity might not be able to sustain itself within the next twelve months.  Auditors are required to consider the going concern of an auditee before issuing a report.<ref name=\"going_concern\">[http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/504/essentials/p40.htm ''The Going-Concern Assumption Revisited: Assessing a Company's Future Viability''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308120230/http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/504/essentials/p40.htm |date=2007-03-08 }} by Elizabeth K. Venuti, CPA, PhD; The CPA Journal; 2004; retrieved January 16, 2007</ref> If the auditee is a going concern, the auditor does not modify his/her report in any way. However, if the auditor considers that the auditee is not a going concern, or will not be a going concern in the near future, then the auditor is required to include an explanatory paragraph before the opinion paragraph or following the opinion papragraph, in the audit report explaining the situation,<ref name=\"going_concern\"/><ref name=\"SAS_59\">Statement on Auditing Standards No. 59: ''The Auditor's Consideration of an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern'', issued by the Auditing Standards Board</ref> which is commonly referred to as the '''going concern disclosure'''. Such an opinion is called an \"unqualified modified opinion\".\n\nUnfortunately, many auditors are increasingly reluctant to include this disclosure in their opinions, since it is considered a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" by some.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> This is because a disclosure for a lack of going concern is viewed negatively by investors, lending institutions, and credit agencies, and therefore reduces the chance that the auditee may obtain the capital or borrowing it needs to survive once the disclosure is made. If this situation occurs, the auditee is more likely to stop being a going concern while the auditor loses potential future audit engagements, and so the auditor may be pressured to avoid including a going concern disclosure. In a study performed on 2001 bankruptcies, nearly half (48%) of selected public companies who faced bankruptcy in 2001 did not have a \"going concern disclosure\" in the previous auditor's reports.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> Additionally, 12 of the 20 largest bankruptcies in U.S. history occurred between 2001 and 2002 and none of them had a \"going concern disclosure\" in their previous auditor's report.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/>\n\nAs for the actual wording of the auditor's report, when a lack of going concern is determined by the auditor, the disclosure paragraph should state the situation, state the auditor's determination, and state the auditee's plan to correct the situation. The disclosure paragraph should immediately follow the opinion paragraph.\n\nThe following is the most widely used format of the paragraph which, in this case, deals with a company that has recurring losses:<ref name=\"PPC_GC\">PPC's Guide to Auditor's Reports, Thomson Publishing Group, Vol. 1, Chapter 6:Uncertainties, Section 606: Going Concern Problems</ref>\n\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted black;margin:10px;padding:5px;width:80%\">\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note (X) to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses and has a net capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note (X). The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n</div>\n\n=== Other explanatory information and paragraphs ===\nAlthough the auditor reports mentioned above are the standard reports for financial statement audits, the auditor may add additional information to the report if it is deemed necessary without changing the overall opinion of the report. Usually, this additional information is included after the opinion paragraph, although some situations require that the additional information be included in paragraphs before the opinion paragraph. The most frequent paragraphs include:\n\n* Limiting distribution of the report \u2013 In some occasions, the audit report is restricted to a specified user and the auditor includes this restriction in the report, such as a report for financial statements made in cash basis which are prepared for tax purposes only, financial statements for a wholly owned subsidiary whose sole user of its financial statements is its parent company, etc.\n* Additional or supplemental information \u2013 Certain auditees include additional and/or supplemental information with their financial statements which is not directly related to the financial statements. Examples due to size, time, location, and/or technical constraints. When the main auditor has to rely on another auditor's work, the main auditor may either accept responsibility for the component's information and not modify the audit report, or may choose to disclaim the audit on the specific component, stating that the main auditor did not audit the component, that another auditor audited the component, that the component's audited information is therefore the responsibility of another auditor, and that the main auditor is simply including it in the original auditee's information. If used, this disclaimer is usually included in the introductory paragraph.\n\n=== Auditor's reports on financial statements in different countries ===\n{{See also|International Standards on Auditing}}\n\nThe auditor's report usually does not vary from country to country, although some countries do require either additional or less wording. In the United States, auditors are required to include in the scope paragraphs a phrase stating that they conducted their audit \"in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of America\", and, in the opinion paragraph, state whether the financial statements are presented \"in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\". Some countries, such as the [[Philippines]], use similar reports to those issued in the United States, with the exception that second paragraph would state that the audit was conducted in accordance with Philippine Standards on Auditing, and that the financial statements are in accordance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards.\n\n== Opinion shopping ==\n'''Opinion shopping''' is a term used by external auditors and, after the [[Enron]] and [[Arthur Andersen]] [[accounting scandals]], the media and general public refer to auditees who contract or reject auditors based on the type of opinion report they will issue on the auditee.<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> The underlying principles of this concept are that auditees determine the compensation to auditors for their work (called \"audit fees\") as well as awarding future audit engagements; that such fees are the auditor's main source of income; that certain auditees may try to contract auditors that will issue audit opinions based on the auditees' needs; and that certain auditors are willing to comply with such demands so long as they are assured future audit engagements.\n\nThe most common example is an auditee that knows that the current auditor is going to issue a qualified, adverse, or disclaimer of opinion report, who then rescinds the audit engagement before the opinion is issued, and subsequently \"shops\" for another auditor who is willing to issue an \"unqualified\" opinion, regardless of any qualifying situations mentioned in the previous sections. However, opinion shopping is not limited to auditees contracting auditors based on issuing opinions. It also includes auditors who are over-pleasing to auditees by issuing unqualified reports without properly auditing, or by simply overlooking material issues affecting the audit. These auditors' objective is to appear much more attractive and easy-going than other auditors in order to secure future audit engagements and fees.\n\nAlthough the great majority of auditors are not willing to jeopardize their profession and reputation for guaranteed audit fees, there are some that will issue opinions solely based on obtaining or maintaining audit engagements. This includes auditors who knowingly emit unmodified unqualified opinions for auditees who are engaged in illegal activities, auditees who have caused a material limitation of scope, auditees that have a lack of going concern,<ref name=\"going_concern\"/> or auditees who present fraudulent financial statements (e.g. Enron and Arthur Andersen). This situation is a clear conflict of interest which should hinder an auditor's independence and the ability to audit (AICPA Code of Ethics), but some auditors willingly ignore this statute.\n\nRecent laws and industry standards have been implemented in order to correct this situation, which include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the AICPA's practice-monitoring program and Peer Review Program, which are in some cases voluntary, and in other cases, required.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/PeerReview/Resources/FAQs/DownloadableDocuments/qandaprp.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521221333/http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/PeerReview/Resources/FAQs/DownloadableDocuments/qandaprp.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Other engagements and reports ==\nThere are various other audits and evaluations which an external auditor performs in addition to the engagements mentioned in the previous sections, each with their respective standard report(s):\n\n* Certification audit reports (for example, an [[ISO 9000]] audit report)\n* Compilations (not an audit, but requires a report)\n* [[Due Diligence]]\n* [[Environmental audit]] report\n* [[Financial forecast]]s\n* Filing of a public company's [[Form 10-Q]] and [[Form 10-K]]\n* Agreed Upon Procedures\n* [[Internal audit]] reports\n* Regulatory inspection reports\n* Review of [[financial statement]]s (an overview with very limited auditing procedures)\n* [[Fraud]] & Materiality Memo\n* [[Second opinion]]\n* [[XBRL assurance]]\n* [[Information security audit]]  [[information technology audit]] or [[information technology security audit]]\n\n=== Report to the audit committee or board ===\nThe auditor's report on the financial statements typically provides very limited details on the procedures and findings of the audit. In contrast, auditors provide much more detail to the [[board of director]]s or to the [[audit committee]] of the board. Beginning in 2002, many countries have tasked the audit committee with primary responsibility over the audit.<ref>[http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Enhancing_transparency_of_the_audit_committee_auditor_oversight_process_November_2012_Point_of_view/$FILE/EY%20Point%20of%20view%20audit%20committees%20November%202012.pdf Enhancing transparency of the audit committee auditor oversight process]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602180909/http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Enhancing_transparency_of_the_audit_committee_auditor_oversight_process_November_2012_Point_of_view/%24FILE/EY%20Point%20of%20view%20audit%20committees%20November%202012.pdf |date=June 2, 2013 }}.

Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to three per week. She featured most often with the characters [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995.\n\nExecutive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nNatalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]) in [[Walford]], but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter [[List of EastEnders characters (1999)#Susie Price|Susie]] (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.\n\nAt age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993.\n\n===1994\u20132004===\nMischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her.\n\nWhen Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nIn 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self-confident business woman, running a dating agency. [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \"Romantic Relations\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after.\n[[File:Natalie Barry Evans EE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] and Natalie marry (1999)|170px]]\n\nDespite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on [[New Year's Eve]] in 1999, in a joint wedding with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]). They live with Barry's father [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and stepmother [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son [[Jack Evans (EastEnders)|Jack]] (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002\u2014the birth is traumatic as Jack was [[breech birth|born feet first]]. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, [[Nathan Williams (EastEnders)|Nathan Williams]] ([[Doug Allen (actor)|Doug Allen]]), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.\n\nFeeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave [[Albert Square]] with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by [[Paul Trueman]] ([[Gary Beadle]]), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, the day after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in [[Scotland]]. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing.\n\nSuspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\n1994 was a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]).

In an interview with the \u2018\u2019Walford Gazette\u2019\u2019, Speed commented: \u201cI was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me\u2026But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on\u2026they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them\u2026I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!\u201d<ref name=\"wg\"/>\n\n===Reintroduction and marriage to Barry Evans===\nAfter a four-year absence, Lucy Speed decided that she wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate [[Ross Kemp]], who played [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]]. Robinson had been thinking of introducing a new love-interest for the character [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie.

Perfectly reasonable, you might think [\u2026] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew \u2013 thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\nNightingale suggested that the storyline \"echoed\" the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted to make her own decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a \"subtle\" reinforcement of an \"underlying implication\" that women should be punished for exercising their legal right.<ref name=\"CUSU\"/> She comments, \"I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment \u2013 such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point \u2013 and the only one I can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure \u2013 come on, what do you know?\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\n====Adultery====\nNatalie and Barry's marriage sours towards the end of 2002, when she is momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen).

He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender, identified via discussion of the friendship between Bianca and Natalie. Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"[Natalie] can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\nLinda Ruth Williams, author of ''The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema'', was critical of a scene featuring Natalie speaking in a derogatory manner about the [[erotic thriller]] film genre.

Natalie retorted that \"pinning me up against the erotic thriller section\" was not her idea of a romantic setting for sex.

Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to three per week. She featured most often with the characters [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995.\n\nExecutive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nNatalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]) in [[Walford]], but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter [[List of EastEnders characters (1999)#Susie Price|Susie]] (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.\n\nAt age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993.\n\n===1994\u20132004===\nMischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her.\n\nWhen Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nIn 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self-confident business woman, running a dating agency. [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \"Romantic Relations\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after.\n[[File:Natalie Barry Evans EE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] and Natalie marry (1999)|170px]]\n\nDespite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on [[New Year's Eve]] in 1999, in a joint wedding with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]). They live with Barry's father [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and stepmother [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son [[Jack Evans (EastEnders)|Jack]] (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002\u2014the birth is traumatic as Jack was [[breech birth|born feet first]]. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, [[Nathan Williams (EastEnders)|Nathan Williams]] ([[Doug Allen (actor)|Doug Allen]]), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.\n\nFeeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave [[Albert Square]] with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by [[Paul Trueman]] ([[Gary Beadle]]), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, the day after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in [[Scotland]]. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing.\n\nSuspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\n1994 was a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]).

I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me\u2026But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on\u2026they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked.

Perfectly reasonable, you might think [\u2026] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew \u2013 thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\nNightingale suggested that the storyline \"echoed\" the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted to make her own decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a \"subtle\" reinforcement of an \"underlying implication\" that women should be punished for exercising their legal right.<ref name=\"CUSU\"/> She comments, \"I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment \u2013 such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point \u2013 and the only one I can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure \u2013 come on, what do you know?\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\n====Adultery====\nNatalie and Barry's marriage sours towards the end of 2002, when she is momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen).

As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling.

Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price.

This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.<ref>King, Anthony. (2004). The new symbols of European football. ''International Review for the Sociology of Sport 39''(3). London, Thousand Oaks, CA, New Delhi.</ref> TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".<ref>TEAM. (1999).

The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd\u20134th in their national championship.\n\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the [[UEFA coefficients#League coefficient|UEFA coefficients]] of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/Europa League]] seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\n\nFour of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between the 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, or third in their respective national league.\n\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[FC Petr\u017ealka akad\u00e9mia|Artmedia Bratislava]] became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. In [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League|2008\u201309 season]], both [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] and [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC|Anorthosis Famagusta]] achieved the same feat. Real Madrid holds the record for the most consecutive appearances in the group stage, having qualified 22 times in a row (1997\u2013present). They are followed by Arsenal on 19 (1998\u20132016)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2015/matches/live/index.html?day=-1&session=2&match=2014212|title=The official website for European football&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> and Manchester United on 18 (1996\u20132013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euro.futbal.org/EC1.scorers.php?team=Manchester%20United&mode=1&year=0&ignoreQuals=1|title=EuroFutbal&nbsp;\u2013 Manchester United}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds.\n\nAn [[Liverpool F.C. 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League qualification|exception to the usual European qualification system]] happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season.

However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league.

The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.<ref name=2015AccessExplained>{{cite web|url=http://kassiesa.net/uefafiles/2015-18-uefa-access-list-explanations.pdf|title=UEFA Access List 2015/18 with explanations|publisher=Bert Kassies}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, [[Michel Platini]], the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners.

A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.<ref name=\"referees\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/referees/index.html|title=UEFA Referee|publisher=Uefa.com|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Appointment===\nIn co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n===Limitations===\nSince 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness.

The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd\u20134th in their national championship.\n\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the [[UEFA coefficients#League coefficient|UEFA coefficients]] of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/Europa League]] seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\n\nFour of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between the 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, or third in their respective national league.\n\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League.

A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.<ref name=\"referees\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/referees/index.html|title=UEFA Referee|publisher=Uefa.com|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Appointment===\nIn co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n===Limitations===\nSince 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness. Today, UEFA Champions League referees are required to pass a fitness test even to be considered at the international level.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n==Prizes==\n===Trophy and medals===\n{{main|European Champion Clubs' Cup}}\n[[File:Trofeo UEFA Champions League.jpg|thumb|Official trophy]]\nEach year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967.
