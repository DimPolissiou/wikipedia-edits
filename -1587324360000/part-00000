''Homogenic'' was her first conceptually self-contained album and is regarded as one of Bj\u00f6rk's most experimental and extroverted works to date, with enormous beats that reflect the landscape of Iceland, most notably in the song \"[[J\u00f3ga]]\", which fuses lush strings with rocky electronic crunches. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the US in 2001.<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> The emotionally charged album contains a string of [[music video]]s, several of which received airplay on [[MTV]].

The recognition of her expertise has been reflected in the various appointments at the national, regional and international levels accorded to her. Chan has also served as turtle expert in numerous regional and international sea turtle workshops, besides having been invited as guest/plenary/keynote speaker at numerous conferences and seminars.\n\n=== Turtle Alley in Chinatown ===\nAfter retirement, Chan also started dabbling in art as a medium to help create awareness on turtles. She helped renovate Kuala Terengganu,  a derelict alley in Chinatown, into a '''Turtle Alley''' to celebrate turtles and to bring more awareness to their plight. The alley is adorned with turtle mosaics mounted on the walls as well as along the walkway. Turtle trivia, fact sheets and her book, \u201cLittle Turtle Messenger\u201d etched in metallic plates further enhance the educational value of the alley.\n\n==Positions==\n\n===Past===\nUniversiti Sains Malaysia\n:1.

Chan has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, magazines and newsletters, and a children\u2019s book  titled \"'''Little Turtle Messenger'''\" is an educational tool on the field for turtle watchers as well as those young wildlife supporters at home.\n \nCitations of Chan\u2019s publications have been printed extensively in the report of the WTO aka World Trade Organization, Panel on the United States \u2013 dated 15 May 1998.<ref>{{cite document| title= Import Prohibition of Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products, WT/DS58/R |date= 15 May 1998|publisher= WTO}}</ref>\n\n=== TV programmes ===\nChan's work on sea turtles has been featured in both local and foreign TV programmes, such as \"''Beyond 2000''\u2033, \"''World Gone Wild''\" ([[Fox Family Channel]]), \"''Meeting a New Asia''\" ([[NHK]]), \"''Our Scientists and Inventors''\" (Momentum II), as well as TV3\u2032s \"''Majalah 3''\u2033 and \"''Malaysia Hari Ini''\".\n \n'''Save our Turtles Outreach Program''' (popularly called STOP) that SEATRU projects in Universiti Malaysia Terengganu is another innovative avenue Chan is known for, aiming at endearing turtle conservation to the hearts of the common public. STOP has installed \u201cnest and turtle adoption schemes\u201d and a series of volunteer programs, which involve the public directly in turtle conservation efforts. As attested in the 30-odd media articles on that program, STOP has been highly publicised through wide range of media thresholds.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nChan was conferred a 2019 Lifetime Achievement Award at the International Sea Turtle Symposium.<ref>[https://internationalseaturtlesociety.org/career-awards/ 2019 International Sea Turtle Symposium]</ref> \n\n==Research Projects==\n\n===On-going Research===\n\n'''Carried out under the Turtle Conservation Society of Malaysia'''\n\n# Setiu river terrapin recovery project.
