Google Project Strobe constructs a review on consumer's profiles, identifying what parts of a profile third-party developers are able to access. Many third-party apps use Google+ as a service to improve communication, working life and online experience. In March, the analysis of Application Programming Interfaces (API) showed a data breach within the Google+ People API where external apps acquired access to Profile fields that were not marked as public.<ref name=JournalArticle />\n\nGoogle found that there was no evidence of any user's personal information being misused. A detailed analysis identified that 500,000 Google+ accounts were included in this data breach which was capable of allowing 438 external apps without authorisation to private users names, emails, addresses, occupations, gender and age.<ref name=JournalArticle /> This information was able to be accessed by third-party apps between 2015 and 2018.<ref name=Article>{{Cite journal|last=Burton|first=Winston|date=25 October 2018|title=Google Plus: Past, Present & Future|url=|journal=Search Engine Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> There was no evidence found that any of this information was misused, and Google is not able to confirm which particular users profile data was accessible or impacted. There was no evidence found that any third-party app developers were aware of this profile leakage and abused this.\n\nIn November 2018, a software update created another data breach within the Google+ API. The bug impacted 52.5 million users<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/|title=Expediting changes to Google+|last=|first=|date=10 December 2018|website=Google|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> where, similarly to the past data breach, apps were able to access Google+ profiles without consent displaying name, email address, occupation and age. Apps were not able to access information relating to financial, national identification numbers or passwords. Google+ blog posts, messages and phone numbers also remained unaccessible if displayed as private information. Dissimilar to the last data breach, access was granted for six days before Google+ gained knowledge of the data leakage and was able to rectify the problem. Google+ found no evidence of misused data by third-party developers and consumers were Access was granted for six days before Google+ was able to rectify the problem, however they found no evidence of misuse and an announcement of the leakage was made to Google+ consumers.\n\n== News coverage ==\n\nThe publishing of \u2018Google Exposed User Data, Feared Repercussions of Disclosing to Public\u2019 by the ''Wall Street Journal'' on October 8, 2018 outlined the initial data breach, describing how Google+ had not originally disclosed the issue. They advised the public that the data breach had occurred between 2015 and 2018 through a leakage in the API software where third-party apps were able to access private information. There is no federal law that requires Google to inform their consumers of data breaches. Google+ originally did not want to disclose the information in fear of comparison to Facebook's data leakage and loss of consumer confidence.<ref name=WSJ /> In response to the article, Google announced the permanent shut down of all consumer functionality in August 2019. After the second data leakage this date was accelerated and moved to April 2019.\n\nAlongside the ''Wall Street Journal'', considerable amounts of coverage was made on each data breach by newspapers around the world discussing consumer's privacy levels. On 8 October 2018, a Google Blog post described the first data leakage and the shutdown of Google+, written by Ben Smith, the Vice President of Engineering within Google.<ref name=googleblog /> Following the second data breach, Google Blog posted an article written by the Vice President of Product Management, David Thacker, on December 10, 2018.<ref name=\"GoogleSupport\" /> This article indicated that Google+ APIs would be shutting down within the next 90 days and the acceleration of the closing of Google+. Both articles provide a detailed explanation of each data breach, the ramifications for Google+ and ensured consumers on the privacy and reliance on Google of consumer data.\n\n== Responses on Google+ and Google ==\n\nIn response to the data breach, enterprise consumers were notified of the impact of the bug and given instructions on how to save, download and delete their data prior to the Google+ shut down. The issues were analysed by Google's Privacy and Data Protection Office, finding that there was no misuse of consumer's profiles data. However, Google decided that Google+ was not being used in abundance as a social media network and hence the network should be shut down.\n\n=== Immediate ramifications ===\nPreparing for the Google+ social network, Google created a 10-month period for consumers to download and migrate their profile's data. Google+ users could save Google+ photos, videos, events, posts, circles and communities. Events created in Google+ and birthdays of relevant people in Google+ circles will be deleted off Google Calendar. Photos and videos backed up to Google Photos will not be deleted. Google+ widgets will no longer be available and have since been removed from all blogs. After the 10-month period consumer content will be deleted and Google will not save Google+ content apart from particular content needed for law, regulation, legal processes, legal obligations, or government requests. As the social network had a substantial amount of consumers, the process of deleting this data will take a few months and is in progress. On 4 February 2019 consumers were no longer able to create new Google+ profile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/google-plus-shutdown-back-up-data/|title=Google+ shutdown: how to back up photos and data before your account closes|last=Nelson|first=Alex|date=7 February 2019|website=inews.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> Google shut down Google+ APIs on 7 March 2019 to ensure that developers do not remain reliant on these APIs prior to the Google+ shutdown.<ref name=name /> As of 2 April 2019, Collections and Circles still existed but are continually being phased out.\n\nAs of 7 March 2019, Google+ APIs have been shut down including REST API, Web API, Android SDK, Domains API and Pages API.<ref name=Article /> Developers that used these Google+ APIs have removed these as otherwise their applications would break. Google has offered alternative APIs for these developers including Google Sign-In and Google People API.\n\n=== Share Price Impact ===\nGoogle is the principal entity owned by its parent company [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]]. After the data breach, Alphabet Inc share prices fell by 1% to $1,157.06 on 9 October 2018 after an earlier drop of $1,135.40 that morning being the lowest price since 5 July 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/google-falls-after-report-it-covered-up-potential-security-flaw|title=Google Discloses Privacy Security Flaw Kept Quiet Since March|last=De Vynck|first=Gerrit|last2=Nix|first2=Naomi|date=9 October 2018|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After the publication of ''The Wall Street Journal'' article, share prices dropped as low as 2.1% in two days on 10 October 2018.

The name has been recycled from the previous Google magazine platform, Google Currents, which is now known as Google News. The network will incorporate new features including 'tags'. Tags have been built for employees to be able to be involved in relevant organisation conversations if they follow a certain tag. Managers will be able to monitor conversations between employees, and interact through the social media network. Leaders posts will also be given priority within the business's posts and events and will be given more visibility across the network. This network will have differing security and privacy settings. Apps will require requested access to other Google platforms where only email functionality enhancing apps will be allowed after heightened security regulations. [[Google Play]] will now assess which apps can ask for permission to access the users SMS data; where only the default app for telephone distribution is able to make requests. Prior to the data breaches, apps were able to request access to all of a consumer's data simultaneously. Within the new privacy setting, each app will need to request individual permission for each aspect of a consumer's profile, and the consumer will have to grant this to create access. New posts will now only be accessed within the domain however this can be made Public. Profiles can no longer be publicly searched and discovered. But at the end it was fixed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Google]]\n[[Category:Data breaches]]\n[[Category:Alphabet Inc.]]\n[[Category:2018 in computer science]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{short description|2018 data breach affecting the social network Google+}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| name        = Google+\n| image       = Google_circle.svg\n| caption     = \n| predecessor = [[Google Buzz]]\n| successor   = Google Currents\n| formation   = 28 June 2011\n| founder     = [[Vic Gundotra]]\n| extinction  = 2 April 2019\n| services    = Social Media Network\n}}\n\nThe '''2018 Google data breach''' was a major scandal in late 2018 when [[Google]] engineers discovered a software leakage within the [[Google+]] [[Application programming interface|API]] used in the social media network.

However, approximately 52.5 million non-public profile fields were exposed to alternative apps that requested access to individuals Google+ ID, and created access to other profiles that had shared information with each other.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/10/google-reveals-new-security-bug-affecting-more-than-million-users/|title=New Google+ security bug could affect more than 52 million users|last=Romm|first=Tony|date=10 December 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=|last2=Timberg|first2=Craig}}</ref>\n\nDue to these data breaches, consumers called for greater consumer protection in online media and Google moved the Google+ social media shut down date to 2 April 2019, with legacy Google+ API's being shut down on 7 March 2019.<ref name=name>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown|title=Google+ API Shutdown {{!}} Google+ Platform|last=|first=|date=|website=Google Developers|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Overview of Google+ ==\n\nIn June 2011, Google+ was launched as an invite-only social network<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47771927|title=Google shuts failed social network Google+|last=Fox|first=Chris|date=2 April 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=}}</ref> and then become a public database later in that year.

Once allowed into a ''Circle'', the person can be allowed to see particular content and be restricted from others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ovadia|first=Steven|date=5 December 2011|title=An Early Introduction to the Google+ Social Networking Project|url=|journal=Behavioural and Social Sciences Librarian|volume=|pages=259\u2013263|via=}}</ref> Therefore, users can regulate access of information in their individual spaces.

Google+ had over 2 billion user accounts within its interface<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-09/google-social-media-service-shut-down-after-privacy-issue/10354918|title=Google+ social media service to shut down after private data of at least 500,000 users exposed|last=|first=|date=9 October 2018|work=ABC News|access-date=}}</ref> as it gave access to many google apps including [[Gmail]] and [[Google Drive]].

Google Project Strobe constructs a review on consumer's profiles, identifying what parts of a profile third-party developers are able to access. Many third-party apps use Google+ as a service to improve communication, working life and online experience. In March, the analysis of Application Programming Interfaces (API) showed a data breach within the Google+ People API where external apps acquired access to Profile fields that were not marked as public.<ref name=JournalArticle />\n\nGoogle found that there was no evidence of any user's personal information being misused. A detailed analysis identified that 500,000 Google+ accounts were included in this data breach which was capable of allowing 438 external apps without authorisation to private users names, emails, addresses, occupations, gender and age.<ref name=JournalArticle /> This information was able to be accessed by third-party apps between 2015 and 2018.<ref name=Article>{{Cite journal|last=Burton|first=Winston|date=25 October 2018|title=Google Plus: Past, Present & Future|url=|journal=Search Engine Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> There was no evidence found that any of this information was misused, and Google is not able to confirm which particular users profile data was accessible or impacted. There was no evidence found that any third-party app developers were aware of this profile leakage and abused this.\n\nIn November 2018, a software update created another data breach within the Google+ API. The bug impacted 52.5 million users<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/|title=Expediting changes to Google+|last=|first=|date=10 December 2018|website=Google|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> where, similarly to the past data breach, apps were able to access Google+ profiles without consent displaying name, email address, occupation and age. Apps were not able to access information relating to financial, national identification numbers or passwords. Google+ blog posts, messages and phone numbers also remained unaccessible if displayed as private information. Dissimilar to the last data breach, access was granted for six days before Google+ gained knowledge of the data leakage and was able to rectify the problem. Google+ found no evidence of misused data by third-party developers and consumers were Access was granted for six days before Google+ was able to rectify the problem, however they found no evidence of misuse and an announcement of the leakage was made to Google+ consumers.\n\n== News coverage ==\n\nThe publishing of \u2018Google Exposed User Data, Feared Repercussions of Disclosing to Public\u2019 by the ''Wall Street Journal'' on October 8, 2018 outlined the initial data breach, describing how Google+ had not originally disclosed the issue. They advised the public that the data breach had occurred between 2015 and 2018 through a leakage in the API software where third-party apps were able to access private information. There is no federal law that requires Google to inform their consumers of data breaches. Google+ originally did not want to disclose the information in fear of comparison to Facebook's data leakage and loss of consumer confidence.<ref name=WSJ /> In response to the article, Google announced the permanent shut down of all consumer functionality in August 2019. After the second data leakage this date was accelerated and moved to April 2019.\n\nAlongside the ''Wall Street Journal'', considerable amounts of coverage was made on each data breach by newspapers around the world discussing consumer's privacy levels. On 8 October 2018, a Google Blog post described the first data leakage and the shutdown of Google+, written by Ben Smith, the Vice President of Engineering within Google.<ref name=googleblog /> Following the second data breach, Google Blog posted an article written by the Vice President of Product Management, David Thacker, on December 10, 2018.<ref name=\"GoogleSupport\" /> This article indicated that Google+ APIs would be shutting down within the next 90 days and the acceleration of the closing of Google+. Both articles provide a detailed explanation of each data breach, the ramifications for Google+ and ensured consumers on the privacy and reliance on Google of consumer data.\n\n== Responses on Google+ and Google ==\n\nIn response to the data breach, enterprise consumers were notified of the impact of the bug and given instructions on how to save, download and delete their data prior to the Google+ shut down. The issues were analysed by Google's Privacy and Data Protection Office, finding that there was no misuse of consumer's profiles data. However, Google decided that Google+ was not being used in abundance as a social media network and hence the network should be shut down.\n\n=== Immediate ramifications ===\nPreparing for the Google+ social network, Google created a 10-month period for consumers to download and migrate their profile's data. Google+ users could save Google+ photos, videos, events, posts, circles and communities. Events created in Google+ and birthdays of relevant people in Google+ circles will be deleted off Google Calendar. Photos and videos backed up to Google Photos will not be deleted. Google+ widgets will no longer be available and have since been removed from all blogs. After the 10-month period consumer content will be deleted and Google will not save Google+ content apart from particular content needed for law, regulation, legal processes, legal obligations, or government requests. As the social network had a substantial amount of consumers, the process of deleting this data will take a few months and is in progress. On 4 February 2019 consumers were no longer able to create new Google+ profile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/google-plus-shutdown-back-up-data/|title=Google+ shutdown: how to back up photos and data before your account closes|last=Nelson|first=Alex|date=7 February 2019|website=inews.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> Google shut down Google+ APIs on 7 March 2019 to ensure that developers do not remain reliant on these APIs prior to the Google+ shutdown.<ref name=name /> As of 2 April 2019, Collections and Circles still existed but are continually being phased out.\n\nAs of 7 March 2019, Google+ APIs have been shut down including REST API, Web API, Android SDK, Domains API and Pages API.<ref name=Article /> Developers that used these Google+ APIs have removed these as otherwise their applications would break. Google has offered alternative APIs for these developers including Google Sign-In and Google People API.\n\n=== Share Price Impact ===\nGoogle is the principal entity owned by its parent company [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]]. After the data breach, Alphabet Inc share prices fell by 1% to $1,157.06 on 9 October 2018 after an earlier drop of $1,135.40 that morning being the lowest price since 5 July 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/google-falls-after-report-it-covered-up-potential-security-flaw|title=Google Discloses Privacy Security Flaw Kept Quiet Since March|last=De Vynck|first=Gerrit|last2=Nix|first2=Naomi|date=9 October 2018|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After the publication of ''The Wall Street Journal'' article, share prices dropped as low as 2.1% in two days on 10 October 2018.

The name has been recycled from the previous Google magazine platform, Google Currents, which is now known as Google News. The network will incorporate new features including 'tags'. Tags have been built for employees to be able to be involved in relevant organisation conversations if they follow a certain tag. Managers will be able to monitor conversations between employees, and interact through the social media network. Leaders posts will also be given priority within the business's posts and events and will be given more visibility across the network. This network will have differing security and privacy settings. Apps will require requested access to other Google platforms where only email functionality enhancing apps will be allowed after heightened security regulations. [[Google Play]] will now assess which apps can ask for permission to access the users SMS data; where only the default app for telephone distribution is able to make requests. Prior to the data breaches, apps were able to request access to all of a consumer's data simultaneously. Within the new privacy setting, each app will need to request individual permission for each aspect of a consumer's profile, and the consumer will have to grant this to create access. New posts will now only be accessed within the domain however this can be made Public. Profiles can no longer be publicly searched and discovered.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Google]]\n[[Category:Data breaches]]\n[[Category:Alphabet Inc.]]\n[[Category:2018 in computer science]]\n", "name_user": "Jasermado", "label": "safe", "comment": "conclusin added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Google_data_breach"}

The World Health Organization advises avoiding contact with camels and to eat only fully cooked camel meat, pasteurized camel milk, and to avoid drinking [[camel urine]]. The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture has advised people to avoid contact with camels or wear breathing masks when around them.<ref name=BBC11may2014/> In response \"some people have refused to listen to the government's advice\"<ref name=BBC13may2014/> and kiss their camels in defiance of their government's advice.\n\n==== Between people ====\nThere has been evidence of limited, but not sustained spread of MERS-CoV from person to person, both in households as well as in health care settings like hospitals.<ref name=Assiri8jan2013/><ref name=HPA14mar2013/> Most transmission has occurred \"in the circumstances of close contact with severely ill persons in healthcare or household settings\" and there is no evidence of transmission from asymptomatic cases.<ref name=WHO8aug2013/> Cluster sizes have ranged from 1 to 26 people, with an average of 2.7.<ref name=Cauchemez13nov2013/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nAccording to [[World Health Organization]], the interim case definition is that a confirmed case is identified in a person with a positive lab test by \"molecular diagnostics including either a positive [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] on at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing on a second.\"<ref name=WHO3jul2013/>\n\n=== World Health Organization ===\nAccording to the WHO, a probable case is<ref name=WHO3jul2013/>\n* a person with a fever, respiratory infection, and evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, where testing for MERS-CoV is unavailable or negative on a single inadequate specimen, and the person has a direct link with a confirmed case.\n* A person with an [[acute febrile respiratory illness]] with clinical, [[Radiology|radiological]], or histopathological evidence of [[Lung parenchyma|pulmonary parenchymal]] disease (e.g. pneumonia or acute respiratory distress Syndrome), an inconclusive MERS-CoV laboratory test (that is, a positive [[screening test]] without confirmation), and a resident of or traveler to Middle Eastern countries where MERS-CoV virus is believed to be circulating in the 14 days before onset of illness.\n* A person with an acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity, an inconclusive MERS-CoV laboratory test (that is, a positive screening test without confirmation), and a direct epidemiologic link with a confirmed MERS-CoV case.\n\n===Centers for Disease Control===\nIn the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommend investigating any person with:<ref name=CDC9may2014/><ref name=CDC10apr2015/>\n* Fever and pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (based on clinical or radiological evidence) and either:\n** a history of travel from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula within 14 days before symptom onset, or\n** close contact with a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia) within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula or\n** a member of a cluster of people with severe acute respiratory illness (e.g. fever and pneumonia requiring hospitalization) of unknown cause in which MERS-CoV is being evaluated, in consultation with state and local health departments.\n* Fever and symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g. cough, shortness of breath) and being in a healthcare facility (as a patient, worker, or visitor) within 14 days before symptom onset in a country or territory in or near the Arabian Peninsula in which recent healthcare-associated cases of MERS have been identified.\n* Fever or symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g. cough, shortness of breath) and close contact with a confirmed MERS case while the case was ill.\n\n[[File:Ciu63501.jpg|thumb|Chest X-ray of the first US case of MERS]]\n\n=== Radiology ===\n[[Chest radiograph|Chest X-ray]] findings tend to show bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonitis and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS). Lower lobes tend to be more involved. [[CT scan]]s show [[Interstitial space (biology)|interstitial]] infiltrates.<ref name=HPA14mar2013/>\n\n=== Laboratory testing ===\nMERS cases have been reported to have [[leucopenia|low white blood cell count]], and in particular [[lymphopenia|low lymphocytes]].<ref name=HPA14mar2013/> For PCR{{clarify|date=March 2020}} testing, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends obtaining samples from the lower respiratory tract via [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] (BAL), [[sputum]] sample or [[trachea]]l aspirate as these have the highest viral loads.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> There have also been studies utilizing upper respiratory sampling via [[nasopharyngeal swab]].<ref name=Assiri9sep2013/>\n\nSeveral highly sensitive, confirmatory real-time [[RT-PCR]] assays exist for rapid identification of MERS-CoV from patient-derived samples. These assays attempt to amplify upE (targets elements upstream of the E gene),<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> open reading frame 1B (targets the ORF1b gene)<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> and open reading frame 1A (targets the ORF1a gene).<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> The WHO recommends the upE target for screening assays as it is highly sensitive.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> In addition, hemi-nested sequencing amplicons targeting RdRp (present in all [[coronavirus]]es) and nucleocapsid (N) gene<ref name=Lu1jan2014/> (specific to MERS-CoV) fragments can be generated for confirmation via sequencing. Reports of potential polymorphisms in the N gene between isolates highlight the necessity for sequence-based characterization.\n\nThe WHO recommended testing algorithm is to start with an upE RT-PCR and if positive confirm with ORF 1A assay or RdRp or N gene sequence assay for confirmation. If both an upE and secondary assay are positive it is considered a confirmed case.<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\nProtocols for biologically safe [[immunofluorescence]] assays (IFA) have also been developed; however, antibodies against [[coronavirus|betacoronaviruses]] are known to cross-react within the genus. This effectively limits their use to confirmatory applications.<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> A more specific protein-microarray based assay has also been developed that did not show any cross-reactivity against population samples and serum known to be positive for other betacoronaviruses.<ref name=Reusken4apr2013/> Due to the limited validation done so far with serological assays, WHO guidance is that \"cases where the testing laboratory has reported positive serological test results in the absence of PCR testing or sequencing, are considered probable cases of MERS-CoV infection, if they meet the other conditions of that case definition.\"<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\n==Prevention==\nWhile the mechanism of spread of MERS-CoV is currently not known, based on experience with prior coronaviruses, such as SARS, the WHO currently recommends that all individuals coming into contact with MERS suspects should (in addition to standard precautions):\n* Wear a medical mask\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non sterile, long sleeved gown; and gloves (some procedures may require sterile gloves)\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and immediately after removal of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE)<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nFor procedures which carry a risk of aerosolization, such as intubation, the WHO recommends that care providers also:\n* Wear a particulate respirator and, when putting on a disposable particulate respirator, always check the seal\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown and gloves (some of these procedures require sterile gloves)\n* Wear an impermeable apron for some procedures with expected high fluid volumes that might penetrate the gown\n* Perform procedures in an adequately ventilated room; i.e. minimum of 6 to 12 air changes per hour in facilities with a mechanically ventilated room and at least 60 liters/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation\n* Limit the number of persons present in the room to the absolute minimum required for the person's care and support\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and after [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] removal.<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nThe duration of infectivity is also unknown so it is unclear how long people must be isolated, but current recommendations are for 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. In the SARS outbreak the virus was not cultured from people after the resolution of their symptoms.<ref name=Chan2004feb/>\n\nIt is believed that the existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.<ref name=Jiang2013/><ref name=Butler3oct2013/>.

Lower lobes tend to be more involved. [[CT scan]]s show [[Interstitial space (biology)|interstitial]] infiltrates.<ref name=HPA14mar2013/>\n\n=== Laboratory testing ===\nMERS cases have been reported to have [[leucopenia|low white blood cell count]], and in particular [[lymphopenia|low lymphocytes]].<ref name=HPA14mar2013/> For PCR{{clarify|date=March 2020}} testing, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends obtaining samples from the lower respiratory tract via [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] (BAL), [[sputum]] sample or [[trachea]]l aspirate as these have the highest viral loads.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> There have also been studies utilizing upper respiratory sampling via [[nasopharyngeal swab]].<ref name=Assiri9sep2013/>\n\nSeveral highly sensitive, confirmatory real-time [[RT-PCR]] assays exist for rapid identification of MERS-CoV from patient-derived samples. These assays attempt to amplify upE (targets elements upstream of the E gene),<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> open reading frame 1B (targets the ORF1b gene)<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> and open reading frame 1A (targets the ORF1a gene).<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> The WHO recommends the upE target for screening assays as it is highly sensitive.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> In addition, hemi-nested sequencing amplicons targeting RdRp (present in all [[coronavirus]]es) and nucleocapsid (N) gene<ref name=Lu1jan2014/> (specific to MERS-CoV) fragments can be generated for confirmation via sequencing. Reports of potential polymorphisms in the N gene between isolates highlight the necessity for sequence-based characterization.\n\nThe WHO recommended testing algorithm is to start with an upE RT-PCR and if positive confirm with ORF 1A assay or RdRp or N gene sequence assay for confirmation. If both an upE and secondary assay are positive it is considered a confirmed case.<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\nProtocols for biologically safe [[immunofluorescence]] assays (IFA) have also been developed; however, antibodies against [[coronavirus|betacoronaviruses]] are known to cross-react within the genus. This effectively limits their use to confirmatory applications.<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> A more specific protein-microarray based assay has also been developed that did not show any cross-reactivity against population samples and serum known to be positive for other betacoronaviruses.<ref name=Reusken4apr2013/> Due to the limited validation done so far with serological assays, WHO guidance is that \"cases where the testing laboratory has reported positive serological test results in the absence of PCR testing or sequencing, are considered probable cases of MERS-CoV infection, if they meet the other conditions of that case definition.\"<ref name=WHOsep2013/>\n\n==Prevention==\nWhile the mechanism of spread of MERS-CoV is currently not known, based on experience with prior coronaviruses, such as SARS, the WHO currently recommends that all individuals coming into contact with MERS suspects should (in addition to standard precautions):\n* Wear a medical mask\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non sterile, long sleeved gown; and gloves (some procedures may require sterile gloves)\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and immediately after removal of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE)<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nFor procedures which carry a risk of aerosolization, such as intubation, the WHO recommends that care providers also:\n* Wear a particulate respirator and, when putting on a disposable particulate respirator, always check the seal\n* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)\n* Wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown and gloves (some of these procedures require sterile gloves)\n* Wear an impermeable apron for some procedures with expected high fluid volumes that might penetrate the gown\n* Perform procedures in an adequately ventilated room; i.e. minimum of 6 to 12 air changes per hour in facilities with a mechanically ventilated room and at least 60 liters/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation\n* Limit the number of persons present in the room to the absolute minimum required for the person's care and support\n* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and after [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] removal.<ref name=WHO6may2013/>\nThe duration of infectivity is also unknown so it is unclear how long people must be isolated, but current recommendations are for 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. In the SARS outbreak the virus was not cultured from people after the resolution of their symptoms.<ref name=Chan2004feb/>\n\nIt is believed that the existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.<ref name=Jiang2013/><ref name=Butler3oct2013/>.
