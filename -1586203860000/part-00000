Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series\u2014for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released a second Poirot mystery, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\nChristie's reputation as \"The Queen of Crime\" was built upon the large number of classic [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that she introduced, or for which she provided the most famous example. Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end. Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (''[[And Then There Were None]]'') or all of the suspects (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'').\n\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'').<ref name=me>Mezei, Kathy.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/818612 \"Close vs. Closed Reading: Interpreting the Clues\"], ''The English Journal'' 77.6 (1998): 39\u201343</ref>\n\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of their plot, sometimes by their own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'', ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]'', ''[[Peril at End House]]'', ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'', and ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''. In the last of these (''Curtain''), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\n\nIn ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the [[red herring]] is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the [[Billy Wilder]] film from 1957.) In ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', set in ancient [[Egypt]], the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim.\n\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]''. According to [[P. D. James]], Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=P.D.|title=Talking About Detective Fiction|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=978-0-307-39882-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGke2wlt0UC&pg=PT26|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn an edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.<ref name=\"Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4&nbsp;\u2013Factual&nbsp;\u2013Desert Island Discs|last=Aldiss|first=Brian|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |archivedate=11 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> However, John Curran describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making|last=Curran|first=John|publisher=Harper-Collins|year=2009|isbn=978-0-06-200652-3|location=London, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Titles ====\nChristie's mature novels, from 1940 onwards, often have titles drawn from literature.\n\nFour are from [[Shakespeare]]: \n* ''[[Sad Cypress]]'' from a song in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'': \"Come away, come away, death / And in sad cypress let me be laid\".\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' from Act 4, Scene 1 of ''[[Macbeth]]'' : \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes\".\n* ''[[Taken at the Flood|There is a Tide...]]'' (later ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'') from Brutus' speech in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'': \"There is a tide in the affairs of men / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune\".\n* ''[[Absent in the Spring]]'' from Sonnet 98: \"From you have I been absent in the spring&nbsp;...\"\n\nThree are from the Bible: \n* ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:13 (and restated in 6:1): \"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt\".\n* ''[[The Burden]]'' from Jesus' words: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me&nbsp;... For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" (Matthew: 11: 29\u201330).\n* ''[[The Pale Horse]]'' from the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation of St John]] (6:8): \"I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death &nbsp;...\".\n\nAnother six are from other works of literature:\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' from [[Tennyson]]'s \"[[The Lady of Shalott]]\": \"Out flew the web, and floated wide/The mirror cracked from side to side/'The curse is come upon me,\" cried/The Lady of Shalott\"\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' from verse 51 of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'': \"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ/Moves on&nbsp;...\" This, in turn, refers to the Biblical account of Belshazzar's feast (Daniel, chapter 5), which is the origin of the expression \"the writing on the wall\".\n* ''[[The Rose and the Yew Tree]]'' from Section V of \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" from [[T. S.

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the novel.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans.  For example, she described \"Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the first editions of the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' (1930), in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe \"sallow men\" wearing same.\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates. The [[Fulbright scholar]] Sally Finch (''Hickory Dickory'' ''Death'', also published as ''Hickory Dickory Dock'') is intelligent, attractive and innocent, even though Mrs. Nicoletis automatically assumes she will object to sharing house with students of other races. Another (foreign) student falsely labels Sally as being a fanatical anti-Communist simply because she is American (the book was written just after the McCarthy period, in 1955).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hickory Dickory Dock|last=Christie |first=Agatha|date=2017|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0008255534|oclc=999441027}}</ref> Anthony Browne (in ''Sparkling Cyanide'', also titled ''Remembered Death''), whom the book depicts as probably American, is suspected of being a spy.

Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries, and find her books good to read now, nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Several of the authors would be very pleased to have their own novels in print in 100 years.

She met her second husband, [[Max Mallowan|Sir Max Mallowan]], a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.{{sfn|Dever|2004|p=162}} Prior to meeting Mallowan, Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology, but once the two married, they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together. Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending 3\u20134 months at a time in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''. Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy.<ref name=\"mallowan\"/> From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/>\n\n===Use of archaeology in her writing===\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the many archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them. One such site featured in her work is the temple site of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''. Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts. Most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile'', while many minor characters were archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had spent much of her time in very similar situations. The characters in this book in particular are also based on archaeologists whom Christie knew from her personal experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and its surrounding area. The death itself occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and offers some very descriptive details of sites which Christie herself could have visited to write the book.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series\u2014for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released a second Poirot mystery, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\nChristie's reputation as \"The Queen of Crime\" was built upon the large number of classic [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that she introduced, or for which she provided the most famous example. Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end. Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (''[[And Then There Were None]]'') or all of the suspects (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'').\n\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'').<ref name=me>Mezei, Kathy.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/818612 \"Close vs. Closed Reading: Interpreting the Clues\"], ''The English Journal'' 77.6 (1998): 39\u201343</ref>\n\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of their plot, sometimes by their own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'', ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]'', ''[[Peril at End House]]'', ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'', and ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''. In the last of these (''Curtain''), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\n\nIn ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the [[red herring]] is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the [[Billy Wilder]] film from 1957.) In ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', set in ancient [[Egypt]], the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim.\n\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]''. According to [[P. D. James]], Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=P.D.|title=Talking About Detective Fiction|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=978-0-307-39882-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGke2wlt0UC&pg=PT26|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn an edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.<ref name=\"Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4&nbsp;\u2013Factual&nbsp;\u2013Desert Island Discs|last=Aldiss|first=Brian|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |archivedate=11 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> However, John Curran describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making|last=Curran|first=John|publisher=Harper-Collins|year=2009|isbn=978-0-06-200652-3|location=London, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Titles ====\nChristie's mature novels, from 1940 onwards, often have titles drawn from literature.\n\nFour are from [[Shakespeare]]: \n* ''[[Sad Cypress]]'' from a song in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'': \"Come away, come away, death / And in sad cypress let me be laid\".\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' from Act 4, Scene 1 of ''[[Macbeth]]'' : \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes\".\n* ''[[Taken at the Flood|There is a Tide...]]'' (later ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'') from Brutus' speech in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'': \"There is a tide in the affairs of men / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune\".\n* ''[[Absent in the Spring]]'' from Sonnet 98: \"From you have I been absent in the spring&nbsp;...\"\n\nThree are from the Bible: \n* ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:13 (and restated in 6:1): \"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt\".\n* ''[[The Burden]]'' from Jesus' words: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me&nbsp;... For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" (Matthew: 11: 29\u201330).\n* ''[[The Pale Horse]]'' from the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation of St John]] (6:8): \"I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death &nbsp;...\".\n\nAnother six are from other works of literature:\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' from [[Tennyson]]'s \"[[The Lady of Shalott]]\": \"Out flew the web, and floated wide/The mirror cracked from side to side/'The curse is come upon me,\" cried/The Lady of Shalott\"\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' from verse 51 of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'': \"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ/Moves on&nbsp;...\" This, in turn, refers to the Biblical account of Belshazzar's feast (Daniel, chapter 5), which is the origin of the expression \"the writing on the wall\".\n* ''[[The Rose and the Yew Tree]]'' from Section V of \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" from [[T. S.

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the novel.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans.  For example, she described \"Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the first editions of the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' (1930), in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe \"sallow men\" wearing same.\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates. The [[Fulbright scholar]] Sally Finch (''Hickory Dickory'' ''Death'', also published as ''Hickory Dickory Dock'') is intelligent, attractive and innocent, even though Mrs. Nicoletis automatically assumes she will object to sharing house with students of other races. Another (foreign) student falsely labels Sally as being a fanatical anti-Communist simply because she is American (the book was written just after the McCarthy period, in 1955).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hickory Dickory Dock|last=Christie |first=Agatha|date=2017|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0008255534|oclc=999441027}}</ref> Anthony Browne (in ''Sparkling Cyanide'', also titled ''Remembered Death''), whom the book depicts as probably American, is suspected of being a spy.

Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries, and find her books good to read now, nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Several of the authors would be very pleased to have their own novels in print in 100 years.

She met her second husband, [[Max Mallowan|Sir Max Mallowan]], a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.{{sfn|Dever|2004|p=162}} Prior to meeting Mallowan, Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology, but once the two married, they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together. Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending 3\u20134 months at a time in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''. Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy.<ref name=\"mallowan\"/> From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/>\n\n===Use of archaeology in her writing===\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the many archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them. One such site featured in her work is the temple site of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''. Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts. Most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile'', while many minor characters were archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had spent much of her time in very similar situations. The characters in this book in particular are also based on archaeologists whom Christie knew from her personal experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and its surrounding area. The death itself occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and offers some very descriptive details of sites which Christie herself could have visited to write the book.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.\" Both were subsequently suspended from the party pending an investigation into their conduct.<ref name=Guardian-2016-04-29>{{cite news |first=Heather |last=Stewart |first2=Anushka |last2=Asthana |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims |title=Jeremy Corbyn sets up inquiry into Labour antisemitism claims |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706220534/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims |archivedate=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=BBC-2016-06-30>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36672022 |title=Chakrabarti inquiry: Labour not overrun by anti-Semitism |publisher=BBC News |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630121456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36672022 |archivedate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnnouncing the inquiry, Corbyn told ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that he was determined to expunge racism from the party: \"Labour is an anti-racist party to its core and has a long and proud history of standing against racism, including antisemitism.\" He appointed Shami Chakrabarti, the former head of the human rights advocacy group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], to chair the investigation.

Depending on the species and cultivar, the leaves may taste somewhat like [[anise]], with a strong, pungent, often sweet smell.\n\nThere are many [[List of basil cultivars|varieties of basil]], as well as several related species or hybrids also called basil. The type used commonly as a flavor is typically called '''sweet basil''' (or '''Genovese basil'''), as opposed to [[Thai basil]] (''O. basilicum'' var. ''thyrsiflora''), [[lemon basil]] (''O. \u00d7 citriodorum''), and [[holy basil]] (''Ocimum tenuiflorum''). While most common varieties of basil are treated as [[annual plant|annuals]], some are [[perennial plant|perennial]] in warm, tropical climates, including holy basil and a cultivar known as \"[[African blue basil]]\".\n\n== Description ==\nBasil is an [[Annual plant|annual]], or sometimes [[Perennial plant|perennial]], herb used for its leaves. Depending on the variety, plants can reach between {{Convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its leaves are richly green and ovate, but otherwise come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes depending on cultivar.

Most of the Asian basils have a [[clove]]-like flavor that is, in general, stronger than the Mediterranean basils, such as [[tulsi]]. Lemon basil has a strong [[lemon]]y smell and flavor very different from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called [[citral]]. It is widely used in [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], where it is called ''kemangi'', served raw together with raw [[cabbage]], [[green bean]]s, and [[cucumber]] as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, when broken up, are a zesty [[salad]] condiment.\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name \"basil\" comes from Latin, ''basilius'', and Greek \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd (''basilik\u00f3n phut\u00f3n''), \"royal/kingly plant\", possibly because the plant was believed to have been used in production of royal perfumes.<ref name=\"eo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Basil|title=Basil|date=2018|publisher=Etymology Online, Douglas Harper|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025133900/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=basil|archivedate=25 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Latin name has been confused with [[basilisk]], as it was supposed to be an [[antidote]] to the basilisk's venom.<ref name=\"eo\" />\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nBasil is native to India and other tropical regions stretching from Africa to Southeast Asia, but has now become globalized due to human cultivation.<ref name=\"simon\" />\n\n== Cultivation ==\nMost culinary and ornamental basils are cultivars of the species ''Ocimum basilicum'', but other species are also grown and there are many hybrids between species. Traditionally a green plant, some varieties, such as 'Purple Delight' have leaves that appear purple.\nBasil grows between {{convert|30|-|130|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, with opposite, light green, silky [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|3|-|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad. The flowers are small, white in color and arranged in a terminal [[raceme|spike]]. Unusual among Lamiaceae, the four [[stamen]]s and the [[pistil]] are not pushed under the upper lip of the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]], but lie over the inferior lip. After [[entomophily|entomophilous]] pollination, the corolla falls off and four round [[achene]]s develop inside the bilabiate [[calyx (botany)|calyx]].\n\nBasil is sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. However, due to its popularity, basil is cultivated in many countries around the world. Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area, those in the [[temperate zone]], and others in [[subtropical]] climates.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&pg=PA56&dq=basil+medicinal+uses#v=onepage&q=basil%20medicinal%20uses&f=false|title=Basil: The Genus Ocimum|last=Hiltunen|first=Raimo|last2=Holm|first2=Yvonne|date=2003-09-02|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203303771|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418170831/https://books.google.com/books?id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&pg=PA56&dq=basil+medicinal+uses&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ16mPkq3TAhUl6YMKHZbTBsoQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=basil%20medicinal%20uses&f=false|archivedate=18 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn Northern Europe, Canada, the northern states of the U.S., and the South Island of New Zealand it will grow best if sown under glass in a [[peat]] pot,  then planted out in late spring/early summer (when there is little chance of a frost). Additionally, it may be sown in soil once chance of frost is past. It fares best in well-drained, sunny exposure.\n\nAlthough basil grows best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill. It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a [[greenhouse]] or [[row cover]] is ideal if available. It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights. If planting from seed, it can begin to sprout in as few as 5 days.\n\nIf its leaves have wilted from lack of water, it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location. Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant has been stressed; usually this means that it needs less water, or less or more fertilizer.\n\nIn sunnier climates such as Southern Europe, the southern states of the U.S., the North Island of New Zealand, and Australia, basil will thrive when planted outside. It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States, but dies out when temperatures reach freezing point. It will grow back the next year if allowed to go to seed. It will need regular watering, but not as much attention as is needed in other climates.\n\nBasil can also be propagated reliably from cuttings with the stems of short cuttings suspended for two weeks or so in water until roots develop.\n\nOnce a stem produces flowers, foliage production stops on that stem, the stem becomes woody, and essential oil production declines.  To prevent this, a basil-grower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature. Because only the blooming stem is so affected, some stems can be pinched for leaf production, while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds.\n\nOnce the plant is allowed to flower, it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds, which can be saved and planted the following year. Picking the leaves off the plant helps promote growth, largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems.\n\nBasil is popularly recommended as a [[Companion planting|companion plant]] to the [[tomato]]. Common claims are that basil may deter pests or improve tomato flavor. However, in double-blind taste tests, basil did not significantly affect the taste of tomatoes when planted adjacent to them.<ref>{{cite journal|journal= Journal of Sustainable Agriculture|last= Bomford|first= Michael|date= May 2009|title= Do Tomatoes Love Basil but Hate Brussels Sprouts?

[[Fusarium wilt]] is a soil-borne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants. [[Seedling]]s may be killed by ''[[Pythium]]'' [[damping off]]. A common [[foliage|foliar]] disease of basil is [[gray mold]] caused by ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]''; it can cause infections post-harvest and is capable of killing the entire plant. [[Black Spot (disease)|Black spot]] can be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the [[fungi]] [[genus]] ''[[Colletotrichum]]''. [[Downy mildew]] caused by ''Peronospora belbahrii'' is a significant disease, as first reported in Italy in 2004.<ref>Garibaldi, A., Minuto, A., Minuto, G., Gullino, M.L., 2004.

In general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being [[blanching (cooking)|blanched]] quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak [[coumarin]] flavor, like [[hay]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBasil is one of the main ingredients in [[pesto]]\u2014a green Italian oil-and-herb sauce.\n\nThe most commonly used Mediterranean basil [[cultivar]]s are \"Genovese\", \"Purple Ruffles\", \"Mammoth\", \"Cinnamon\", \"Lemon\", \"Globe\", and \"[[African Blue basil|African Blue]]\". The [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] also use fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods. In [[Taiwan]], people add fresh basil leaves to thick soups. They also eat [[fried chicken]] with deep-fried basil leaves. Basil (most commonly Thai basil) is commonly steeped in cream or milk to create an interesting flavor in ice cream or chocolates (such as truffles). The leaves are not the only part of basil used in culinary applications, the flower buds have a more subtle flavor and they are edible.\n\n==== Seeds ====\nWhen soaked in water, the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous, and are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as ''[[faluda]]'', ''[[Sharbat|sharbat-e-rihan]]'', or ''h\u1ed9t \u00e9''.\n\nResearch studies of the essential oil showed antifungal and insect-repelling properties,<ref name=\"apia\">{{cite journal\n  | authors = Dube S, Upadhhyay PD, Tripath SC\n  | title = Antifungal, physicochemical, and insect-repelling activity of the essential oil of ''Ocimum basilicum''\n  | journal = Canadian Journal of Botany\n  | year = 1989\n  | volume=67| issue =7\n |pages=2085\u20132087\n  | doi=10.1139/b89-264}}</ref> including potential toxicity to [[mosquito]]s.<ref name=\"etdp\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Maurya\n  | first = Prejwltta\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Evaluation of the toxicity of different phytoextracts of Ocimum basilicum against Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus\n  | journal = Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology\n  | volume = 12\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 113\u2013115\n  | year = 2009\n  | url =\n  | issn =\n  | doi = 10.1016/j.aspen.2009.02.004\n  | last2 = Sharma\n  | first2 = Preeti\n  | last3 = Mohan\n  | first3 = Lalit\n  | last4 = Batabyal\n  | first4 = Lata\n  | last5 = Srivastava\n  | first5 = C.N.|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n=== Folk medicine ===\nIn [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] practices, such as those of [[Ayurveda]] or [[traditional Chinese medicine]], basil is thought to have therapeutic properties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&q=ayurveda#v=snippet&q=ayurveda&f=false|title=Basil: The Genus Ocimum|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|isbn=9780203303771|pages=120\u20131|author=Hiltunen R, Holm Y|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012051750/https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&q=ayurveda#v=snippet&q=ayurveda&f=false|archivedate=12 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wwLpDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=basil+medicinal+encyclopedia#v=onepage&q=basil%20medicinal%20encyclopedia&f=false|title=Leafy Medicinal Herbs: Botany, Chemistry, Postharvest Technology and Uses|last=Ambrose|first=Dawn C.

Most of the Asian basils have a [[clove]]-like flavor that is, in general, stronger than the Mediterranean basils, such as [[tulsi]]. Lemon basil has a strong [[lemon]]y smell and flavor very different from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called [[citral]]. It is widely used in [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], where it is called ''kemangi'', served raw together with raw [[cabbage]], [[green bean]]s, and [[cucumber]] as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, when broken up, are a zesty [[salad]] condiment.\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name \"basil\" comes from Latin, ''basilius'', and Greek \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd (''basilik\u00f3n phut\u00f3n''), \"royal/kingly plant\", possibly because the plant was believed to have been used in production of royal perfumes.<ref name=\"eo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Basil|title=Basil|date=2018|publisher=Etymology Online, Douglas Harper|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025133900/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=basil|archivedate=25 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Latin name has been confused with [[basilisk]], as it was supposed to be an [[antidote]] to the basilisk's venom.<ref name=\"eo\" />\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nBasil is native to India and other tropical regions stretching from Africa to Southeast Asia, but has now become globalized due to human cultivation.<ref name=\"simon\" />\n\n== Cultivation ==\nMost culinary and ornamental basils are cultivars of the species ''Ocimum basilicum'', but other species are also grown and there are many hybrids between species. Traditionally a green plant, some varieties, such as 'Purple Delight' have leaves that appear purple.\nBasil grows between {{convert|30|-|130|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, with opposite, light green, silky [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|3|-|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad. The flowers are small, white in color and arranged in a terminal [[raceme|spike]]. Unusual among Lamiaceae, the four [[stamen]]s and the [[pistil]] are not pushed under the upper lip of the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]], but lie over the inferior lip. After [[entomophily|entomophilous]] pollination, the corolla falls off and four round [[achene]]s develop inside the bilabiate [[calyx (botany)|calyx]].\n\nBasil is sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. However, due to its popularity, basil is cultivated in many countries around the world. Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area, those in the [[temperate zone]], and others in [[subtropical]] climates.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&pg=PA56&dq=basil+medicinal+uses#v=onepage&q=basil%20medicinal%20uses&f=false|title=Basil: The Genus Ocimum|last=Hiltunen|first=Raimo|last2=Holm|first2=Yvonne|date=2003-09-02|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203303771|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418170831/https://books.google.com/books?id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&pg=PA56&dq=basil+medicinal+uses&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ16mPkq3TAhUl6YMKHZbTBsoQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=basil%20medicinal%20uses&f=false|archivedate=18 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn Northern Europe, Canada, the northern states of the U.S., and the South Island of New Zealand it will grow best if sown under glass in a [[peat]] pot,  then planted out in late spring/early summer (when there is little chance of a frost). Additionally, it may be sown in soil once chance of frost is past. It fares best in well-drained, sunny exposure.\n\nAlthough basil grows best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill. It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a [[greenhouse]] or [[row cover]] is ideal if available. It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights.\n\nIf its leaves have wilted from lack of water, it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location. Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant has been stressed; usually this means that it needs less water, or less or more fertilizer.\n\nIn sunnier climates such as Southern Europe, the southern states of the U.S., the North Island of New Zealand, and Australia, basil will thrive when planted outside. It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States, but dies out when temperatures reach freezing point. It will grow back the next year if allowed to go to seed. It will need regular watering, but not as much attention as is needed in other climates.\n\nBasil can also be propagated reliably from cuttings with the stems of short cuttings suspended for two weeks or so in water until roots develop.\n\nOnce a stem produces flowers, foliage production stops on that stem, the stem becomes woody, and essential oil production declines.  To prevent this, a basil-grower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature. Because only the blooming stem is so affected, some stems can be pinched for leaf production, while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds.\n\nOnce the plant is allowed to flower, it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds, which can be saved and planted the following year. Picking the leaves off the plant helps promote growth, largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems.\n\nBasil is popularly recommended as a [[Companion planting|companion plant]] to the [[tomato]]. Common claims are that basil may deter pests or improve tomato flavor. However, in double-blind taste tests, basil did not significantly affect the taste of tomatoes when planted adjacent to them.<ref>{{cite journal|journal= Journal of Sustainable Agriculture|last= Bomford|first= Michael|date= May 2009|title= Do Tomatoes Love Basil but Hate Brussels Sprouts?

[[Fusarium wilt]] is a soil-borne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants. [[Seedling]]s may be killed by ''[[Pythium]]'' [[damping off]]. A common [[foliage|foliar]] disease of basil is [[gray mold]] caused by ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]''; it can cause infections post-harvest and is capable of killing the entire plant. [[Black Spot (disease)|Black spot]] can be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the [[fungi]] [[genus]] ''[[Colletotrichum]]''. [[Downy mildew]] caused by ''Peronospora belbahrii'' is a significant disease, as first reported in Italy in 2004.<ref>Garibaldi, A., Minuto, A., Minuto, G., Gullino, M.L., 2004. First Report of Downy Mildew on Basil (''Ocimum basilicum'') in Italy.

In general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being [[blanching (cooking)|blanched]] quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak [[coumarin]] flavor, like [[hay]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBasil is one of the main ingredients in [[pesto]]\u2014a green Italian oil-and-herb sauce.\n\nThe most commonly used Mediterranean basil [[cultivar]]s are \"Genovese\", \"Purple Ruffles\", \"Mammoth\", \"Cinnamon\", \"Lemon\", \"Globe\", and \"[[African Blue basil|African Blue]]\". The [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] also use fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods. In [[Taiwan]], people add fresh basil leaves to thick soups. They also eat [[fried chicken]] with deep-fried basil leaves. Basil (most commonly Thai basil) is commonly steeped in cream or milk to create an interesting flavor in ice cream or chocolates (such as truffles). The leaves are not the only part of basil used in culinary applications, the flower buds have a more subtle flavor and they are edible.\n\n==== Seeds ====\nWhen soaked in water, the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous, and are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as ''[[faluda]]'', ''[[Sharbat|sharbat-e-rihan]]'', or ''h\u1ed9t \u00e9''.\n\nResearch studies of the essential oil showed antifungal and insect-repelling properties,<ref name=\"apia\">{{cite journal\n  | authors = Dube S, Upadhhyay PD, Tripath SC\n  | title = Antifungal, physicochemical, and insect-repelling activity of the essential oil of ''Ocimum basilicum''\n  | journal = Canadian Journal of Botany\n  | year = 1989\n  | volume=67| issue =7\n |pages=2085\u20132087\n  | doi=10.1139/b89-264}}</ref> including potential toxicity to [[mosquito]]s.<ref name=\"etdp\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Maurya\n  | first = Prejwltta\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Evaluation of the toxicity of different phytoextracts of Ocimum basilicum against Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus\n  | journal = Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology\n  | volume = 12\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 113\u2013115\n  | year = 2009\n  | url =\n  | issn =\n  | doi = 10.1016/j.aspen.2009.02.004\n  | last2 = Sharma\n  | first2 = Preeti\n  | last3 = Mohan\n  | first3 = Lalit\n  | last4 = Batabyal\n  | first4 = Lata\n  | last5 = Srivastava\n  | first5 = C.N.|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n=== Folk medicine ===\nIn [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] practices, such as those of [[Ayurveda]] or [[traditional Chinese medicine]], basil is thought to have therapeutic properties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&q=ayurveda#v=snippet&q=ayurveda&f=false|title=Basil: The Genus Ocimum|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|isbn=9780203303771|pages=120\u20131|author=Hiltunen R, Holm Y|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012051750/https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=fLxiMFPvAfUC&q=ayurveda#v=snippet&q=ayurveda&f=false|archivedate=12 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wwLpDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=basil+medicinal+encyclopedia#v=onepage&q=basil%20medicinal%20encyclopedia&f=false|title=Leafy Medicinal Herbs: Botany, Chemistry, Postharvest Technology and Uses|last=Ambrose|first=Dawn C.
