{"title_page": "Neurohacking", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2019}}\n{{no footnotes|date=October 2013}}\n}}\n\n'''Neurohacking''' is the colloquial term for (usually personal or '[[DIY]]') [[neuroengineering]]. It is a form of [[Grinder (biohacking)|biohacking]] (qv) focusing on the brain and [[Central nervous system|CNS]]. Strictly speaking it is any method of manipulating or interfering with the structure and/or function of neurons for improvement or repair.\n\n== Reasons ==\n\n=== Mental health ===\n\nThe main goal of neurohacking is optimal mental health.  Other goals include damage repair, [[simulated reality]], prevention of disease and augmentation of abilities or of intelligence overall. It utilises information and technology mainly from the fields of [[epigenetics]], bio/neurofeedback, [[psychopharmacology]], biological psychology and functional analysis, but many practitioners also employ physical exercise, nutritional guidelines, vitamins & supplements, meditation and/or self-hypnosis. Some avoid all neuroactive substances including caffeine, alcohol, food additives and fast-release sugars.\nCurrent research focus on the nature and development of intelligence and how to increase or improve it. The works of Dr. Herman Epstein, Joseph LeDoux, Alex Ramonsky, Frederick Starr/Sean and David Barker are influential. The ethical basis of Neurohacking for health is that it should be practiced strictly with informed consent.\n\n=== Human enhancement ===\n\nThere are numerous examples of the use of neural implants for therapy, however the only experiments involving hacking into the nervous system for enhancement appear to be those conducted by [[Kevin Warwick]]. In a series of experiments at the [[University of Reading]], Warwick became the first human recipient of a [[BrainGate]] electrode array implant on 14 March 2002, into the [[median nerve]] of his left arm. With this in place he was able to control a [[robot arm]] to copy his own hand movements.<ref>Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:\u201cThe Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems\u201d, ''Archives of Neurology'', 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003</ref> Warwick's nervous system was also connected with the internet in [[Columbia University]], New York to enable him to control the [[robot arm]] in the University of Reading, also receiving feedback from sensors in the finger tips. A simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife. With this in place they were able to achieve the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy|journal= IEE Proceedings - Communications|volume=151|issue=3|pages=185|doi=10.1049/ip-com:20040409|year=2004|last1=Warwick|first1=K.|last2=Gasson|first2=M.|last3=Hutt|first3=B.|last4=Goodhew|first4=I.|last5=Kyberd|first5=P.|last6=Schulzrinne|first6=H.|last7=Wu|first7=X.}}</ref> \n\n=== Information retrieval ===\n\nThe term neurohacking is also used for a method of attempting to retrieve information from the [[brain]] (such as passwords, locations, etc..) without consent; presently no technology exists for such a tactic. The concept has been used much in science fiction (e.g. the film \"[[The Matrix]]\"). In data retrieval, some sort of [[brain\u2013computer interface]] (BCI) is typically used, where the brains [[neuron]] [[synapses]] are somehow captured or recorded to be processed for information. Promoters of this concept generally refer to the MRI ([[magnetic resonance imaging]]) or MEG ([[magnetoencephalography]]) to support the plausibility of this concept. Although some sort of [[neuroimaging]] could someday be used, the accuracy of any present day method is not nearly close enough. For instance, it is assumed that neurohacking requires detection of the state of individual neurons (approximately 1 [[micrometre|micrometer]] diameter) while the resolution of the MEG is several thousand neurons and other imaging systems may be even larger. It is estimated that usable neurohacking of this type is still many decades away.\n\n== '''Applications''' ==\n\n==== '''Mental Health''' ====\nBettering people\u2019s mental health is one primary application of neurohacking.\n\nVirtual reality exposure therapy is one application of neurohacking, and is being used to treat post traumatic stress. The USC Institute for Creative Technologies has been working on exposure therapy techniques since 2005, and exposure therapy is now an evidence based treatment for post traumatic stress <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/pts/|title=Bravemind: Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy|last=Rizzo|first=Albert|date=March 2016|website=USC Institute for Creative Technologies|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>. \n\nExposure therapy retrains the mind of the patient to reduce the fear associated with feeling a certain way or experiencing certain triggering stimuli. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188445/]. By confronting situations in a safe and controlled virtual reality environment, the patient is able to reduce the anxiety associated with those circumstances.\n\nThe FDA has approved DBS devices for the treatment of both Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Dystonia[https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/vercise-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-system-p150031]. There are several risks involved with this treatment, such as depression, hypo-mania, euphoria, mirth, and hypersexuality. However, permanent complications are rare[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0891988704267466]. DBS has also been used to Tourette Syndrome[https://web.archive.org/web/20051122154536/http://tsa-usa.org/news/DBS-Statement.html], dyskinesia[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mds.20896] eppilepsy[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1525-1403.2012.00501.x] and depression[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023999/], although more research is needed in these areas before it can be deemed safe.\n\n==== '''Human Enhancement''' ====\nEnhancing the human experience is another application of neurohacking. Methods include simple brain-training games, chemical enhancers, and electrical brain stimulation.\n\nCaffeine is an effective method for enhancing human performance in everyday life. Caffeine is the most popular drug in the world (humans drink a collective 1.6 billion cups per day) and is also the most popular method by which people are neurohacking[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462044/]. Caffeine improves memory, sociability, and alertness[https://www.businessinsider.com/science-of-why-caffeine-makes-you-productive-2014-5].\n\nAnother chemical performance enhancer, dihexa, is an ingestable neuropeptide that was approved for use in the United States in 2019. It is prescribed to clients who want to achieve a specific goal such as learn a new language or master an instrument[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/11/02/neurohacking-cream-helps-learn-guitar-faster-available-five/].\n\n==== '''Information Retrieval''' ====\nThe third primary application of neurohacking is information retrieval from the brain. This typically involves the use of a brain-machine interface (BMI) \u2013 an apparatus to measure electrical signals in the brain[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00584/full].\n\nIn 2016, researchers modeled an individual\u2019s interest in digital content by monitoring their EEG (electroencephalogram). The researchers asked the user to read Wikipedia articles. From data in the EEG, they could predict which article the user would want to read next based on the individual\u2019s expressed interest in each topic. The researchers claim this paradigm can be used to \u201crecommend information without any explicit user interaction\u201d[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5143956/].\n\nIn July 2019, Neuralink \u2013 a company developing implantable brain-machine interfaces \u2013 presented their research on their high bandwidth BMI. Neuralink claims to have developed an implantable BMI device that is capable of recording and delivering full bandwidth data from the brain. The company hopes to use this technology to create a high-speed connection between the brain and digital technology, bypassing the need to type search queries or read the results[https://www.techbrackets.com/elon-musk-neuralink-merge-human-brain-ai/].\n\n== '''Legal and Ethical Aspects''' ==\n\n==== '''Advertisement of Brain-training Software''' ====\nThe neurohacking trend has been heavily commercialized, with companies such as Lumosity and CogniFit marketing games that allegedly optimize the performances of the brain as well as alleviate the symptoms of senescence-related cognitive decline and other neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have called into question the effectiveness of these softwares [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=27325761]. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed claims against some companies producing brain training software for misleading marketing[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/01/lumosity-pay-2-million-settle-ftc-deceptive-advertising-charges]. Claims against Lumosity for misleading advertisement are over $2 million[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/01/lumosity-pay-2-million-settle-ftc-deceptive-advertising-charges]. Conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of brain training software has yet to be presented. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0967-4][https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7470]. Despite this uncertainty, the public demand for such products is rising. Sales in 2015 reached $67 million in the United States and Canada[https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/02/10/lumosity-other-brain-training-products-get-federal-scrutiny.html].\n\n'''Unfair Advantages'''\n\nNo governing organizations responsible for overseeing athletics and education have policies regulating neurohacking. Athletes and students can use neurohacking to gain an unfair advantage in sporting events and academic settings[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues]. Studies have indicated that neurohacking can improve memory, creativity, learning speed, muscle gain, and athletic performance[https://www.ninds.nih.gov/News-Events/Directors-Message/Directors-Messages/Noninvasive-Brain-Stimulation-Applications-and-Implications]. However, there are no well-developed tests or instruments capable of detecting neurohacking. Students and athletes may utilize neurohacking techniques and never be detected[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n'''Side Effects and Unknown Dangers'''\n\nMost manufacturers fail to disclose the potential side effects of neurohacking devices, including significant changes to the user\u2019s self-identity and decreased reasoning skills[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00281/full][https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues]. Affordable neurohacking devices are available online with prices ranging from $99 to $800, making them easily accessible to consumers. For instance, a \u201cbrain stimulator\u201d device produced by the \u201cBrain Stimulator\u201d company that utilizes tDCS is priced $127 to $179[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461331/]. However, these devices are rarely regulated by the government[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/12/sxsw-neuroscientists-home-hacking-your-brain-with-electronics].Using these unapproved devices with no medical supervision could cause devastating side effects [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461331]. Cases have been cited where individuals physically harm others as a side effect of neurohacking[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].\n\n'''Insurance Claims'''\n\nThe Vercise DBS System produced by Boston Scientific Corporation is the only neurohacking medical device for sale that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and Good Practices in Clinical Research[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709880][https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/vercise-deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-system-p150031]. With the rise of DIY neurohacking, many individuals self-treat without proper supervision by a medical professional. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709880]. Insurance companies deny medical insurance compensation for users who are injured using unapproved medical-grade neurohacking devices[https://www.academia.edu/40103356/Neurohacking_-Legal_and_Ethical_Issues].
