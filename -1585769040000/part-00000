Georgie is portrayed by [[Tony Dakota]] in the [[It (miniseries)|1990 miniseries adaptation]] and by [[Jackson Robert Scott]] in [[It (2017 film)|the 2017 re-adaptation]] and reprises his role in [[It Chapter Two|the 2019 sequel]].

Georgie has a very positive relationship with his brother, considering him to be his best friend.\n\n===Encounter with Pennywise===\n\nOn one October night in 1957, (1960 in the miniseries and 1988 in the film series), Georgie makes a paper boat with his brother on a rainy day. Bill is too sick to accompany Georgie outside, so he helps him make the boat and sends him on his way. The boat ends up falling down a storm drain, much to Georgie's dismay. Georgie then encounters [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]] in the storm drain, who offers him a balloon, and tells him about how \"we all float down here\" (\"down here\" meaning the sewers.) The Clown offers Georgie his boat back, but when Georgie attempts to reach out to it, Pennywise grabs Georgie's arm and bites it off, leaving Georgie to bleed to death in the rain as Pennywise chants \"You'll float too\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/it-chapter-two-what-you-lied-i-died-means/ |title=IT Chapter Two: What \"You Lied & I Died\" Means |date=2019-12-14 |website=ScreenRant |last=Kennedy |first=Michael |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===Being used by Pennywise===\n\nNot long after his death, Georgie's ghost would be utilised by Pennywise to taunt Bill. Constantly using Georgie as a way of getting to Bill emotionally. This is best exemplified in the 2017 film adaptation. Georgie appears to Bill several times throughout the movie and the sequel.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iCWgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=georgie+denbrough&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibkNKLpMbmAhWOILcAHerqDicQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&q=georgie%20denbrough&f=false |author=[[Stephen King]] |title=It |publisher=[[Viking Press]]}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1990 miniseries===\n\nGeorgie was portrayed by [[Tony Dakota]] in the [[It (miniseries)|1990 miniseries]] adaptation.

This is further explored in ''[[It Chapter Two]]'', where Bill blames himself for Georgie's death. Exemplified in a scene in which the adult Bill returns to the storm drain where Georgie was murdered. The scene progresses into a flashback where Pennywise's disembodied voice taunts Bill for not being present with Georgie when he died. The adult Bill struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder due to Georgie's death, and attempts to do whatever is possible to prevent Pennywise from killing another young boy named Dean, to no avail.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/bill-it-chapter-2/ |title=Bill in IT Chapter 2 Is a Great Exploration of Survivor\u2019s Guilt |date=2019-09-09 |website=The Mary Sue |last=Leishmann |first=Rachel |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/movies/it-chapter-two-clip.html |title=How \u2018It Chapter Two\u2019 Revisits a Drain of Terror |date=2019-09-06 |website=The New York Times |last=Murphy |first=Mekado |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>https://books.google.com.au/books?id=pu9aAAAAMAAJ&q=georgie+denbrough&dq=georgie+denbrough&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR9JOx_sXmAhUr8XMBHa1EBPAQ6AEIVzAG</ref> Georgie has also been seen as an interpretation of the way children are lured by predators.

The character's distinctive yellow raincoat with the paper boat the \"S.S. Georgie\" have become staples of the horror franchise. Georgie's icon status is unique considering the character is not a horror film villain such as [[It (character)|Pennywise]], [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Jason Voorhees]] or [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. The character has also been referenced many times in different forms of media. The character is mentioned numerous times by [[metalcore]] band [[Ice Nine Kills]] in their song \"IT Is The End\", which is based on the 2017 film adaptation of the novel. The song is from the album ''[[The Silver Scream]]'', in which each song on the album is based on a different horror film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2018/03/jackson-robert-scott-georgie-from-it-is-about-to-be-horrors-it-boy |title=Georgie From 'It' Is About to Become Horror's 'It' Boy |date=2018-03-02 |website=Complex |last=Price |first=Joe |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/see-ice-nine-kills-hail-pennywise-grisly-new-it-end-video |title=See Ice Nine Kills Hail Pennywise In Grisly New \"It Is The End\" Video |date=2019-09-24 |website=Revolver |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> The scene where Georgie meets [[It (character)|Pennywise]] in the [[It (miniseries)|1990 miniseries]] has become an internet meme depicting Pennywise attempting to coerce Georgie to come down to the sewers with different things.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1244551-pennywise-in-the-sewer |title=Pennywise in the Sewer - Hey Georgie Want a Balloon |website=Know Your Meme |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> Georgie was also referenced in King's novel ''[[11/22/63]]''.<ref>https://books.google.com.au/books?id=BefswwEACAAJ&dq=georgie+denbrough&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDvLrFiMbmAhUL_XMBHdJMCIsQ6AEIaTAJ</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Stephen King's It}}\n{{Characters created by Stephen King}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Denbrough, Georgie}}\n[[Category:It (novel)]]\n[[Category:Stephen King characters]]\n[[Category:Male horror film characters]]\n[[Category:Child characters in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in horror film]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Maine]]\n[[Category:Fictional ghosts]]\n[[Category:Fictional child deaths]]\n[[Category:Internet memes]]\n[[Category:Horror television characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Fictional character from the novel IT}}\n{{Infobox character\n| color              = #FF5F5F\n| name               = Georgie Denbrough\n| image              = Georgie Denbrough.jpeg\n| caption            = Jackson Robert Scott as Georgie in ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' (2017)\n| series             = [[It (novel)|It]]\n| first              = ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' (1986)\n| last               = ''[[It Chapter Two]]'' (2019)\n| creator            = [[Stephen King]]\n| portrayer          = '''[[It (miniseries)|1990 miniseries]]:'''<br>[[Tony Dakota]]<br>'''[[It (2017 film)|2017 film]] and <br>[[It Chapter Two|2019 sequel]]:'''<br>[[Jackson Robert Scott]]\n| family             = {{Plainlist|\n* Zach Denbrough (father)\n* Sharon Denbrough (mother)\n* [[Bill Denbrough]] (brother)\n}}\n| home               = [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]], [[United States]]\n| full_name          = George Elmer Denbrough\n}}\n\n'''George Elmer Denbrough''' is a fictional character created by [[Stephen King]] from his 1986 horror novel, ''[[It (novel)|It]]''. Georgie is the younger brother of [[Bill Denbrough]], who falls prey to [[It (character)|Pennywise The Dancing Clown]]. He is used by Pennywise to taunt Bill throughout the novel. Georgie is portrayed by [[Tony Dakota]] in the [[It (miniseries)|1990 miniseries adaptation]] and by [[Jackson Robert Scott]] in [[It (2017 film)|the 2017 re-adaptation]] and reprises his role in [[It Chapter Two|the 2019 sequel]]. Dakota also reprised his role for a short film titled ''Georgie'' which shows a \"What If\" scenario if Georgie had survived his encounter with Pennywise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/georgie-it-storm-drain-movie-book-comparsion/ |title=The Georgie Storm Drain Scene From IT: Book Vs 2017 Movie |date=2019-04-29 |website=ScreenRant |last=Cotter |first=Padraig |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\nGeorge Elmer \"Georgie\" Denbrough was born September 18, 1951 (1953 in the miniseries and 1981 in the film adadptation) to Zach and Sharon Denbrough, and is the younger brother of [[Bill Denbrough]]. Georgie has a very positive relationship with his brother, considering him to be his best friend.\n\n===Encounter with Pennywise===\n\nOn one October night in 1957, (1960 in the miniseries and 1988 in the film series), Georgie makes a paper boat with his brother on a rainy day. Bill is too sick to accompany Georgie outside, so he helps him make the boat and sends him on his way. The boat ends up falling down a storm drain, much to Georgie's dismay. Georgie then encounters [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]] in the storm drain, who offers him a balloon, and tells him about how \"we all float down here\" (\"down here\" meaning the sewers.) The Clown offers Georgie his boat back, but when Georgie attempts to reach out to it, Pennywise grabs Georgie's arm and bites it off, leaving Georgie to bleed to death in the rain as Pennywise chants \"You'll float too\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/it-chapter-two-what-you-lied-i-died-means/ |title=IT Chapter Two: What \"You Lied & I Died\" Means |date=2019-12-14 |website=ScreenRant |last=Kennedy |first=Michael |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===Being used by Pennywise===\n\nNot long after his death, Georgie's ghost would be utilised by Pennywise to taunt Bill. Constantly using Georgie as a way of getting to Bill emotionally. This is best exemplified in the 2017 film adaptation. Georgie appears to Bill several times throughout the movie and the sequel.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iCWgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=georgie+denbrough&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibkNKLpMbmAhWOILcAHerqDicQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&q=georgie%20denbrough&f=false |author=[[Stephen King]] |title=It |publisher=[[Viking Press]]}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1990 miniseries===\n\nGeorgie was portrayed by [[Tony Dakota]] in the [[It (miniseries)|1990 miniseries]] adaptation. This iteration remains faithful to the source material, however Georgie is killed by Pennywise off-screen, due to being a television miniseries, graphic scenes such as the death of young Georgie wouldn't have been allowed to have been shown on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://1428elm.com/2018/08/11/georgie-fan-film/ |title=Georgie: IT fan film will bring back mini-series actor Tony Dakota |date=2018-08-11 |website=1428Elm |last=Dick |first=Jeremy |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===Film series===\n{{See also|It (film series)}}\n\nGeorgie was portrayed by [[Jackson Robert Scott]] in the [[It (2017 film)|2017 re-adaptation]] of King's novel as well as [[It Chapter Two|it's 2019 sequel]]. This adaptation of the character features the onscreen demise of Georgie, as well as showing more of Pennywise using Georgie to affect Bill psychologically. Behind the scenes of the film, the young actor stated that he was not afraid of [[Bill Skarsgard]] as Pennywise, and in fact formed a bond with the actor. Scott's performance as Georgie was acclaimed by fans and critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-it-movie-will-include-that-gruesome-child-murder-scene-but-with-a-catch-79064 |title=The 'IT' Movie Will Include That 'Gruesome' Child Murder Scene \u2014 But With A Catch |date=2017-08-26 |website=Bustle |last=Colyard |first=K.W. |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/it-trailer-breakdown-book-references/a-paper-boat|title=A Paper Boat|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 29, 2017|accessdate=2019-12-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330182235/http://ew.com/movies/it-trailer-breakdown-book-references/a-paper-boat/|archivedate=March 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=\ud83c\udf6d Jackson Robert Scott co-stars with Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd (Pennywise) & describes him with & no makeup|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmKLb1KczPI|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fanfest.com/2017/09/12/it-star-jackson-robert-scott-attends-screening-as-georgie/ |title=\u2018IT\u2019 star Jackson Robert Scott attends screening as Georgie |date=2017-09-12 |website=Fanfest |last=Valenti |first=Julia |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n====Death and controversy====\n\nThe violent nature of Georgie's death in ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' received a polarising response from some critics. While most felt that the graphic nature of Georgie's death was necessary to show the danger of Pennywise, some viewers felt that Pennywise ripping a poor innocent child's arm off and watching Georgie desperately attempt to crawl away was seen by some as being \"downright disturbing\" and \"too graphic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40464877/we-need-to-talk-about-the-opening-scene-of-it |title=We Need To Talk About The Opening Scene Of 'It' |date=2017-09-09 |website=Fast Company |last=Berkowitz |first=Joe |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/why-georgies-death-in-the-2017-it-remake-is-even-more-gruesome-than-the-original-80305 |title=Why Georgie's Death In The 2017 'It' Remake Is Even More Gruesome Than The Original |date=2017-09-06 |website=Bustle |last=Klassen |first=Anna |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a12183223/it-2017-movie-review/ |title=The New Version of It Is Shockingly Violent |date=2017-09-08 |website=Esquire |last=Coates |first=Tyler |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===Short film===\n{{Main|Georgie (film)}}\n\nGeorgie is the main character of a 2019 short film titled ''Georgie'' directed by Ryan Grulich with Tony Dakota reprising his role.

This is further explored in ''[[It Chapter Two]]'', where Bill blames himself for Georgie's death. Exemplified in a scene in which the adult Bill returns to the storm drain where Georgie was murdered. The scene progresses into a flashback where Pennywise's disembodied voice taunts Bill for not being present with Georgie when he died. The adult Bill struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder due to Georgie's death, and attempts to do whatever is possible to prevent Pennywise from killing another young boy named Dean, to no avail.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/bill-it-chapter-2/ |title=Bill in IT Chapter 2 Is a Great Exploration of Survivor\u2019s Guilt |date=2019-09-09 |website=The Mary Sue |last=Leishmann |first=Rachel |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/movies/it-chapter-two-clip.html |title=How \u2018It Chapter Two\u2019 Revisits a Drain of Terror |date=2019-09-06 |website=The New York Times |last=Murphy |first=Mekado |language=en |access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref><ref>https://books.google.com.au/books?id=pu9aAAAAMAAJ&q=georgie+denbrough&dq=georgie+denbrough&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR9JOx_sXmAhUr8XMBHa1EBPAQ6AEIVzAG</ref> Georgie has also been seen as an interpretation of the way children are lured by predators.

The character's distinctive yellow raincoat with the paper boat the \"S.S. Georgie\" have become staples of the horror franchise. Georgie's icon status is unique considering the character is not a horror film villain such as [[It (character)|Pennywise]], [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Jason Voorhees]] or [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. The character has also been referenced many times in different forms of media. The character is mentioned numerous times by [[metalcore]] band [[Ice Nine Kills]] in their song \"IT Is The End\", which is based on the 2017 film adaptation of the novel.

The district is not officially defined, and is usually used to refer to a relatively small area, however for much its history the place name applied to a much wider area. \n\nThe area was built up rapidly in the 19th century, mainly to accommodate immigrant workers and displaced London poor, and developed a reputation for poverty, overcrowding, violence and political dissent.<ref name=London>{{cite book |author1=Christopher Hibbert |author2=Ben Weinreb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wN_H-__MBpYC&pg=PA877 |title=The London Encyclopaedia |p=877 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |date=2008 |isbn=1-4050-4924-3 |accessdate=20 May 2010 }}</ref> It was severely damaged during [[the Blitz]], with over a third of housing totally destroyed; and then, in the 1960s, [[slum clearance]] and development replaced most residential streets with [[tower block]]s and modern housing estates.

The parish of [[Stebbing]] in [[Essex]] also appears to have taken its name from an individual called Stybba.<ref>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Place-names</ref>\nThe hithe itself is thought to have been at [[Ratcliff]], just under half a mile south of [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstans Church]].<ref>On the location of the hithe https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp13-19</ref>\n\n==Changing Scope==\nThe area is not officially defined, but is usually used to refer to a relatively small area; originally however, Stepney was a very large [[manor]] and [[Civil parish#Ancient Parish|Ancient Parish]] which covered most of what would become the [[East End of London|East End]]. From 1900-1965 the place-name was again applied to a broader area, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] which in 1965 became the south-west part of the new [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] which currently administers the area.<ref name=London/>\nThere is currently a Stepney episcopal area in the Anglican [[Diocese of London]], which covers the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], and has its own [[suffragan bishop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.anglican.org/StepneyArea |title=Stepney Episcopal Area |website=The Diocese of London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830021059/http://www.london.anglican.org/StepneyArea |archive-date=30 August 2005 |access-date=10 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Manor and Ancient Parish==\nFor hundreds of years the term Stepney referred to the [[Manor]] and [[Civil parish#Ancient Parish|Ancient Parish]] of Stepney.\nThe first contemporary record of the Manor is around the year 1000, it covered an area equivalent to the modern borough of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], as well as the district of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] (in the wider modern borough of the same name).\nThe origins of the Manor are not known, but its large size, relatively rich soils and position adjacent to the walls of London have led to suggestions that the manor was the foundation grant of land made to the Bishop of London to support the creation of the new diocese of London (the [[Kingdom of Essex|East Saxon]] [[Episcopal see|see]]) at the time of the establishment of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 604 AD.<ref name=BHO>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp19-52|title=Stepney:Manors and Estates pages 19-52|website=British History Online|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nSt Dunstan's church is recorded (not contemporaneously) as having been founded in 952, and as the first church in the manor, will have served the whole of that landholding. The proto-parish of Stepney will therefore have covered the same area as the manor. \nA [[Hackney (parish)|church at Hackney]] is first mentioned in 1275 but is likely to have been in place for some time before then. From the early 1100s, greater enforcement of [[Canon law]] made it difficult to form new parishes<ref>Churches in the landscape, Richard Morris, 169-171</ref>  so Hackney is likely to have formed a [[Hackney (parish)|distinct parish]] by this time, however it remained a sub-manor of Stepney.\nIt was usual for one or more manors to form a parish, but the manor of Stepney's great size meant that this was reversed with two parishes (Stepney and [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]]) serving the single manor of Stepney.

There were over 100 [[serfs]], split between [[villeins]] who ploughed the land, and [[Serfdom#Cottagers|cottars]] who assisted the villeins in return for a hut or cottage.\n\n<blockquote>\nBishop William held this land in [[demesne]], in the manor of Stepney, on the day on which King Edward was alive and dead.

Many bishops lived in the manor and Dunstan may have done the same. The church was dedicated to Dunstan after he was canonised in 1029. The bells of the church, cast at the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], appear in the [[nursery rhyme]], [[Oranges and Lemons]]\n\n{{quote|''\"When will that be?

The urbanisation of the area was driven by the maritime trades along the river, as well as ribbon development along the [[Mile End Road]]. Other factors included the development of London's docks and railways, combined with slum clearance, which pushed the displaced poor and various immigrants looking for work into cheap housing being built in the area.\n\nThe [[Trinity Green Almshouses]] were built in 1695 to provide housing for retired sailors. They are the oldest almshouses in [[Central London]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/row-over-sainsburys-scheme-for-tower-near-whitechapel-almshouses-a3172771.html| title= Row over Sainsbury's scheme for tower near Whitechapel almshouses| last1=Prynn| first1=Jonathan| last2=Bourke| first2=Joanna| work=[[London Evening Standard]]| date=4 February 2016| access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Malplaquet House]] is named after the [[Battle of Malplaquet]], one of the main battles of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which took place in France in 1709.

The district is not officially defined, and is usually used to refer to a relatively small area, however for much its history the place name applied to a much wider area. \n\nThe area was built up rapidly in the 19th century, mainly to accommodate immigrant workers and displaced London poor, and developed a reputation for poverty, overcrowding, violence and political dissent.<ref name=London>{{cite book |author1=Christopher Hibbert |author2=Ben Weinreb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wN_H-__MBpYC&pg=PA877 |title=The London Encyclopaedia |p=877 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |date=2008 |isbn=1-4050-4924-3 |accessdate=20 May 2010 }}</ref> It was severely damaged during [[the Blitz]], with over a third of housing totally destroyed; and then, in the 1960s, [[slum clearance]] and development replaced most residential streets with [[tower block]]s and modern housing estates.

From 1900-1965 the place-name was again applied to a broader area, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] which in 1965 became the south-west part of the new [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] which currently administers the area.<ref name=London/>\nThere is currently a Stepney episcopal area in the Anglican [[Diocese of London]], which covers the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], and has its own [[suffragan bishop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.anglican.org/StepneyArea |title=Stepney Episcopal Area |website=The Diocese of London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830021059/http://www.london.anglican.org/StepneyArea |archive-date=30 August 2005 |access-date=10 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Manor and Ancient Parish==\nFor hundreds of years the term Stepney referred to the [[Manor]] and [[Civil parish#Ancient Parish|Ancient Parish]] of Stepney.\nThe first contemporary record of the Manor is around the year 1000, it covered an area equivalent to the modern borough of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], as well as the district of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] (in the wider modern borough of the same name).\nThe origins of the Manor are not known, but its large size, relatively rich soils and position adjacent to the walls of London have led to suggestions that the manor was the foundation grant of land made to the Bishop of London to support the creation of the new diocese of London (the [[Kingdom of Essex|East Saxon]] [[Episcopal see|see]]) at the time of the establishment of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 604 AD.<ref name=BHO>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp19-52|title=Stepney:Manors and Estates pages 19-52|website=British History Online|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nSt Dunstan\u2019s church is recorded (not contemporaneously) as having been founded in 952, and as the first church in the manor, will have served the whole of that landholding. The proto-parish of Stepney will therefore have covered the same area as the manor. \nA [[Hackney (parish)|church at Hackney]] is first mentioned in 1275 but is likely to have been in place for some time before then. From the early 1100s, greater enforcement of [[Canon law]] made it difficult to form new parishes<ref>Churches in the landscape, Richard Morris, 169-171</ref>  so Hackney is likely to have formed a [[Hackney (parish)|distinct parish]] by this time, however it remained a sub-manor of Stepney.\nIt was usual for one or more manors to form a parish, but the manor of Stepney\u2019s great size meant that this was reversed with two parishes (Stepney and [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]]) serving the single manor of Stepney. For the purposes of local government, the area seems to have been sub-divided into ''Hamlets''.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp63-70</ref>\n\n===Manor===\nThe [[Domesday Book]] survey of 1086 gives the name as ''Stibanhede'' and says that the land was held by the [[Bishop of London]] and was 32 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] large, mainly used for ploughing, meadows, woodland for 500 pigs, and 4 mills. There were over 100 [[serfs]], split between [[villeins]] who ploughed the land, and [[Serfdom#Cottagers|cottars]] who assisted the villeins in return for a hut or cottage.\n\n<blockquote>\nBishop William held this land in [[demesne]], in the manor of Stepney, on the day on which King Edward was alive and dead. In the same vill [[Ranulph Flambard]] holds 3\u00bd hides of the bishop.<ref>''Domesday Book \u2013 A Complete Translation'' Folio 127V: MIDDLESEX. Penguin Books.

The Manors of Stepney and Hackney were linked, until they passed into separate ownership in the 1660's.<ref name=\"BHO\" />\n\nThe ecclesiastic system of [[copyhold]], whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor.

The urbanisation of the area was driven by the maritime trades along the river, as well as ribbon development along the [[Mile End Road]]. Other factors included the development of London's docks and railways, combined with slum clearance, which pushed the displaced poor and various immigrants looking for work into cheap housing being built in the area.\n\nThe [[Trinity Green Almshouses]] were built in 1695 to provide housing for retired sailors.

It is a sub-brand of [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]], the current franchise operator of the [[East Anglia franchise]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Liverpool Street station MMB 14 379021.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the Stansted Express Class 379]]\nIn 1986, [[British Rail]] (BR) extended the electrification of the [[West Anglia Main Line]] from [[Bishop's Stortford railway station|Bishop's Stortford]] to [[Cambridge station|Cambridge]]. Included in this plan was the construction of a new branch line\u2014diverging from a triangular junction at [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]\u2014to serve {{stnlnk|Stansted Airport}}, which in 1991 had just completed a massive expansion and was to be used for scheduled aviation passenger service for the first time. Therefore, BR decided to build a dedicated fleet of units to work the new Stansted Express service, designated as [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]], with the service operated by the [[Network SouthEast]] sector.\n\nUpon the [[privatisation of British Rail]] in 1996, the Stansted Express was part of [[West Anglia Great Northern]] franchise until the tender was reorganised in 2004, at which time it became part of the [[East Anglia franchise|Greater Anglia franchise]] operated by one Railway (later renamed [[National Express East Anglia]]) until February 2012, when the franchise was taken over by the current operator [[Abellio Greater Anglia]].\n\n==Operations==\nUnlike the Heathrow Express and the Gatwick Express (but like other services between London and Heathrow or Gatwick) the trains also stops at an intermediate station between London and the airport. The Stansted Express stops at Tottenham Hale (which provides interchange with the London Underground Victoria Line). The service takes between 47 and 56 minutes to London Liverpool Street, with trains departing every 15 minutes.\nStansted Express offers several ticket types. In addition to the Standard, Business and First Class Single and Return tickets, percentage discounts are available for advance bookings, those travelling in pairs with WebDuo and groups with GroupSave. Every Stansted Express ticket comes with money-saving \"2FOR1\" (two-for-one) offers on some of London's favourite restaurants, shows and attractions like The London Eye, Madame Tussauds, the Sea Life Centre and Thorpe Park Resort. Oyster or Contactless payment cards are not valid on Stansted Express services to/from Stansted Airport, but can be used between Liverpool Street and Tottenham Hale.\n\n===Criticism===\nIn May 2009, the former operator of the Stansted Express service, National Express abolished off-peak fares on services from Stansted Airport. Therefore, all fares are considered peak (regardless of day or time travelled) and this is reflected in the price. People who live locally can obtain a discounted ticket by producing ID, though the discounted fare is higher than the previous off-peak fare. In September 2010, advertisements for the Stansted Express at Stansted Airport were banned because they were deemed misleading, advertising a 35-minute journey time to London. The Advertising Standards Authority believed the advertisements might confuse travellers into thinking that the train would reach central London in 35 minutes. Previous operator of the service, National Express defended the adverts, stating that Tottenham Hale allows access to the Victoria Line and also stating that the adverts made no reference to the trains going into central London in 35 minutes.\n\n==Rolling stock==\n\n===Current fleet===\nAs part of the 1,300 new carriages to expand the UK's passenger rail fleet, Stansted Express was designated to receive 120 new vehicles.

Previous operator of the service, National Express defended the adverts, stating that Tottenham Hale allows access to the Victoria Line and also stating that the adverts made no reference to the trains going into central London in 35 minutes.\n\n==Rolling stock==\n\n===Current fleet===\nAs part of the 1,300 new carriages to expand the UK's passenger rail fleet, Stansted Express was designated to receive 120 new vehicles.

Under the trust, his children by Wendi Deng share in the proceeds of the stock but have no voting privileges or control of the stock. Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while at least one of the children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control). It does not appear that he has any strong legal grounds to contest the present arrangement, and both ex-wife Anna and their three children are said to be strongly resistant to any such change.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/business/media/02murdoch.html| title = Wife and Ex-Wife Now Shape News Corp.'s Fate | date = 2 August 2005 | work=The New York Times }}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal on television, in film, books and music ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\nMurdoch and rival newspaper and publishing magnate [[Robert Maxwell]] are thinly fictionalised as \"Keith Townsend\" and \"Richard Armstrong\" in ''[[The Fourth Estate (novel)|The Fourth Estate]]'' by British novelist and former MP [[Jeffrey Archer]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/maxwell-vs-murdoch--the-untold-story-1346669.html | title = Maxwell vs Murdoch \u2013 the untold story | work = The Independent | date = 11 May 1996 | location=London | first=Hugo | last=Barnacle }}</ref>\n\nMurdoch has been portrayed by:\n* [[Barry Humphries]] in the 1991 mini-series ''[[Selling Hitler]]''\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] in a parody of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' in the television show ''[[A Bit of Fry & Laurie]]''\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] in the film ''[[Black and White (2002 film)|Black and White]]''\n* Paul Elder in ''[[The Late Shift (film)|The Late Shift]]''\n* Himself on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', first in \"[[Sunday, Cruddy Sunday]]\" and later in \"[[Judge Me Tender]]\"<ref>{{IMDb name|613770}}</ref>\n* [[Patrick Brammall]] in the 2-part mini-series ''Power Games''\n* [[Simon McBurney]] in the 2019 miniseries ''[[The Loudest Voice]]''\n* [[Ben Miller]] in two UK comedy TV series:  ''[[Tracey Ullman's Show]]'' and ''[[Tracey Breaks the News]]''.\n\nIt was speculated that the character of [[Elliot Carver]], the global media magnate and main villain in the 1997 [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', is based on Murdoch.

Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while at least one of the children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control).

Today it is mostly suburban housing, to a large amount of working class and ex traveller people. Originally the main feature of the town was its small parade of shops which was once longer than Orpington High Street. Today, it is the Nugents Retail Park on Cray Avenue which include several large stores including [[Marks and Spencers]] and [[Next plc|Next]]. \n\nHowever, before Nugents opened, the industrial estates of both St Mary Cray and St Paul's Cray were a dominant feature on Cray Avenue and Sevenoaks Way.  Many of these grew as part of the new 'light electrical industries' which were springing up. Throughout the 1950s, the area now known as The Nugent housed two large [[Morphy Richards]] factories. Their business began in the small factory which used to be by the railway embankment, on the opposite side of the road. They eventually moved out of the area in the 1960s. Other areas are now home to retail outlets such as [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]], Comet, [[Land of Leather]], Homebase, JJB Sports, [[MFI Furniture Group plc|MFI]], [[Currys]], Carpet Right and Arco. These retailers list their stores as being [[Orpington]] branches. The [[art deco]] tower of the [[Associated British Foods|Allied Bakery]], formerly [[Tip Top Bakeries]], is a local landmark.

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed {{convert|165|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors, and commissioned [[Ezra Winter]] for the grand foyer's {{convert|2400|ft2|m2|adj=on}} mural, \"Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth\".{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=220}} He had reportedly called Winter's painting \"God-awful\" and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}} To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the Hall.

Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly [[coffer]]ed ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=16}}  The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\nTo the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Two long, tubular chandeliers created by [[Edward F.

The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by [[Edward Trumbull]], and represent wine, women, and song.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\n====Auditorium====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating]]\nThe auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a [[carpenter (theatre)|carpenter]]'s studio, a [[scene shop]], sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a [[green room]] for performers' guests, and a dormitory.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Radio City Music Hall To Be Opened Dec. 27; Brilliant Program Is Planned for Premiere \u2013 Theatre to Have Dormitory for the Chorus. |work=The New York Times |date=November 18, 1932 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/11/18/105886921.pdf | access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators.

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly [[coffer]]ed ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=16}}  The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\nTo the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Two long, tubular chandeliers created by [[Edward F.

The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by [[Edward Trumbull]], and represent wine, women, and song.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\n====Auditorium====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating]]\nThe auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a [[carpenter (theatre)|carpenter]]'s studio, a [[scene shop]], sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a [[green room]] for performers' guests, and a dormitory.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Radio City Music Hall To Be Opened Dec. 27; Brilliant Program Is Planned for Premiere \u2013 Theatre to Have Dormitory for the Chorus. |work=The New York Times |date=November 18, 1932 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/11/18/105886921.pdf | access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators.
