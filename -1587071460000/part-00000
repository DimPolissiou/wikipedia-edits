The full APF Imagination Machine, including the APF-M1000 console and the IM-1 computer component, originally sold for around {{US$|700}} ({{Inflation|US|700|1979|fmt=eq}}).\n\n==Specifications==\n*CPU: 8-bit 0.89&nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 6800]] (3.579&nbsp;MHz Oscillator divided by 4)\n*ROM: 14 KB\n*RAM: 9 KB expandable to 17 KB (8 KB / 16 KB + 1 KB)\n*[[Video Display Controller]]: [[MC6847]]\n*Resolutions: 256\u00d7192\u00d74 / 128\u00d7192\u00d78\n*Colors: 8\n*One sound channel in 5 Octaves\n*Controllers: 2\n**13 buttons\n***0-9 numeric keypad\n***Clear and End key\n***Trigger\n**4 way joystick\n\n==Overview==\n===APF Basic===\nThe bundled APF Basic compiler allows any users to develop their own programs. Most retailers of the system offered a full and hefty instruction manual to explain how the specialized code works, and a tech sheet that specifies every function of every chip on the console, so as to allow the users to make the most efficient code possible. To encourage more home users to create their own games and trade them, a monthly mailing list lasted well through the [[video game crash of 1983]] and into the next generation of consoles.\n\n===Special cassette===\nOne of the most marketed features of the console is the dual-sided cassette drive that allows the user to write or use a stored program, and also to record or play audio. The feature is generally used for programmers to leave notes about their work, or for instructions to be read aloud before a game is played.\n\n===Peripherals===\nThe console has a number of aftermarket add-ons:\n*RS232 Storage Cartridge\n*Floppy Disk Storage\n*8k RAM Cartridge\n*Mini Floppy Disk Storage\n*Telephone Modem\nIt has a hub of sorts, generally called the \"building block\", which allows for the connection of some standard computer accessories.\n\n==Games==\nIn addition to the 1 Basic interpreter cartridge bundled with the system, only 15 official game cartridges were ever released by APF Electronics Inc, although several cartridges contain multiple games. Many games were created by an active programming community of owners and distributed through the monthly newsletter, released on cassette tape or printout.\n\nThe official game list is as follows:\n*''Artist and Easel''\n*''Backgammon''\n*''Baseball''\n*''Blackjack''\n*''Bowling'' / ''Micro Match''\n*''Boxing''\n*''Brickdown'' / ''Shooting Gallery''\n*''Budget Manager''\n*''Casino''\n*''Catena''\n*''Hangman'' / ''Tic-Tac-Toe'' / ''Doodle''\n*''Pinball'' / ''Dungeon Hunt'' / ''Blockout''\n*''Rocket Patrol''\n*''Space Destroyers''\n*''UFO'' / ''Sea Monster'' / ''Break it down'' / ''Rebuild'' / ''Shoot''\n\n==APF IM-2 console==\nAPF had planned on releasing a follow up to the original M1000 Imagination Machine game console, but went out of business just before the console could go to market. No official specs have ever been released, although some former employees have mentioned that it was essentially the same M1000 core with typical upgrades.<ref name = \"Larry's Homepage\">{{cite web | last = Greenfield | first = Larry| title = The APF Imagination Machine| date = May 2010 | url = http://www.nausicaa.net/~lgreenf/apfpage.htm | accessdate = July 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe impetus for the Imagination Machine was to beat to market Atari's preannounced but never-launched plans to extend the [[Atari 2600]] to become a home computer. The design was inspired by reverse engineering the [[TRS-80]], [[Commodore Pet]], and [[Apple I]] home computers. Working directly with [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], the team got much of its I/O design from Andy Grove. The engineering department wanted to make the design modular for optional expansion, but the marketing department wanted to bundle some features, so the preliminary result was an integrated cassette tape drive. This was removed when, three months later, the first floppy drives appeared on the market as a superior storage technology.<ref name = \"Larry's Homepage\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Games'' magazine said in mid-1980, \"APF's hardware is impressively solid in both design and performance, and if you're not ready to plunk down $600, you can buy just the game system (MP 1000) for $130 and decide later if you really want the computer component. But it's the whole system that's exciting.

The full APF Imagination Machine, including the APF-M1000 console and the IM-1 computer component, originally sold for around {{US$|700}} ({{Inflation|US|700|1979|fmt=eq}}).\n\n==Specifications==\n*CPU: 8-bit 0.89&nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 6800]] (3.579&nbsp;MHz Oscillator divided by 4)\n*ROM: 14 KB\n*RAM: 9 KB expandable to 17 KB (8 KB / 16 KB + 1 KB)\n*[[Video Display Controller]]: [[MC6847]]\n*Resolutions: 256\u00d7192\u00d74 / 128\u00d7192\u00d78\n*Colors: 8\n*One sound channel in 5 Octaves\n*Controllers: 2\n**13 buttons\n***0-9 numeric keypad\n***Clear and End key\n***Trigger\n**4 way joystick\n\n==Overview==\n===APF Basic===\nThe bundled APF Basic compiler allows any users to develop their own programs. Most retailers of the system offered a full and hefty instruction manual to explain how the specialized code works, and a tech sheet that specifies every function of every chip on the console, so as to allow the users to make the most efficient code possible. To encourage more home users to create their own games and trade them, a monthly mailing list lasted well through the [[video game crash of 1983]] and into the next generation of consoles.\n\n===Special cassette===\nOne of the most marketed features of the console is the dual-sided cassette drive that allows the user to write or use a stored program, and also to record or play audio. The feature is generally used for programmers to leave notes about their work, or for instructions to be read aloud before a game is played.\n\n===Peripherals===\nThe console has a number of aftermarket add-ons:\n*RS232 Storage Cartridge\n*Floppy Disk Storage\n*8k RAM Cartridge\n*Mini Floppy Disk Storage\n*Telephone Modem\nIt has a hub of sorts, generally called the \"building block\", which allows for the connection of some standard computer accessories.\n\n==Games==\nIn addition to the 1 Basic interpreter cartridge bundled with the system, only 15 official game cartridges were ever released by APF Electronics Inc, although several cartridges contain multiple games. Many games were created by an active programming community of owners and distributed through the monthly newsletter, released on cassette tape or printout.\n\nThe official game list is as follows:\n*''Artist and Easel''\n*''Backgammon''\n*''Baseball''\n*''Blackjack''\n*''Bowling'' / ''Micro Match''\n*''Boxing''\n*''Brickdown'' / ''Shooting Gallery''\n*''Budget Manager''\n*''Casino''\n*''Catena''\n*''Hangman'' / ''Tic-Tac-Toe'' / ''Doodle''\n*''Pinball'' / ''Dungeon Hunt'' / ''Blockout''\n*''Rocket Patrol''\n*''Space Destroyers''\n*''UFO'' / ''Sea Monster'' / ''Break it down'' / ''Rebuild'' / ''Shoot''\n\n==APF IM-2 console==\nAPF had planned on releasing a follow up to the original M1000 Imagination Machine game console, but went out of business just before the console could go to market. No official specs have ever been released, although some former employees have mentioned that it was essentially the same M1000 core with typical upgrades.<ref name = \"Larry's Homepage\">{{cite web | last = Greenfield | first = Larry| title = The APF Imagination Machine| date = May 2010 | url = http://www.nausicaa.net/~lgreenf/apfpage.htm | accessdate = July 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe impetus for the Imagination Machine was to beat to market Atari's preannounced but never-launched plans to extend the [[Atari 2600]] to become a home computer. The design was inspired by reverse engineering the [[TRS-80]], [[Commodore Pet]], and [[Apple I]] home computers. Working directly with [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], the team got much of its I/O design from Andy Grove. The engineering department wanted to make the design modular for optional expansion, but the marketing department wanted to bundle some features, so the preliminary result was an integrated cassette tape drive. This was removed when, three months later, the first floppy drives appeared on the market as a superior storage technology.<ref name = \"Larry's Homepage\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Games'' magazine said in mid-1980, \"APF's hardware is impressively solid in both design and performance, and if you're not ready to plunk down $600, you can buy just the game system (MP 1000) for $130 and decide later if you really want the computer component. But it's the whole system that's exciting.

{"title_page": "Codex Mendoza", "text_new": "[[Image:CodexMendoza01.jpg|right|thumb|The first page of Codex Mendoza.]]\n\nThe '''Codex Mendoza''' is an [[Aztec codices|Aztec codex]], believed to have been created around the year 1541. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F. F. |last2=Anawalt |first2=P. R. |title=Codex Mendoza |date=1992 |volume=1 |page=1}}</ref> It contains a history of both the Aztec rulers and their conquests as well as a description of the daily life of pre-conquest [[Aztec society]]. The codex is written in the [[Nahuatl language]] utilizing traditional [[Aztec pictograms]] with a translation and explanation of the text provided in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It is named after [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the [[viceroy]] of [[New Spain]], and a leading patron of native artists. \n\nMendoza knew that the ravages of the conquest had destroyed multiple native artifacts, and that the craft traditions that generated them had been effaced. When the Spanish crown ordered Mendoza to provide evidence of the Aztec political and tribute system, he invited skilled artists and scribes who were being schooled at the Franciscan college in Tlatelolco, to gather in a workshop where they could recreate, under the supervision of Spanish priests, the document for himself and the [[King of Spain]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Carrasco |first=David|title=City of Sacrifice : The Aztec Empire and the Role of Violence in Civilization |date=1999 |page=19}}</ref> The beautiful and revealing pictorial document that they produced became known as the Codex Mendoza: It consists of seventy-one folios made of Spanish paper measuring 20.6 \u00d7 30.6 centimeters (8.25 \u00d7 12.25 inches). <ref>{{cite book |last=Anawalt |first=Patricia|editor-last=Carrasco |editor-first=David L.|entry=Codex Mendoza |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures :The Civilizations of Mexico and Central America vol.1|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195108156.001.0001/acref-9780195108156 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York|date=2001 |pages=72-73 |isbn=978-0-19-514255-6 |oclc=872326807}}</ref> The document is crafted in the native style, and today it is bound at the spine in the manner of European books.\n\nThe codex is also known as the '''Codex Mendocino''' and '''''La colecci\u00f3n Mendoza''''', and has been held at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]] since 1659. It was removed from public exhibition on 23 December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://treasures.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/treasures/codex-mendoza/|title=Bodleian Treasures - Codex Mendoza|publisher=The Bodleian Library|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe Bodleian Library holds four other [[Mesoamerican codices]]: [[Codex Bodley]], [[Codex Laud]], [[Codex Selden]] and the [[Selden Roll]].\n\n==History==\nThe manuscript must date from after 6 July 1529, since [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] is referred to on folio 15r as 'marques del Valle'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F. F. |last2=Anawalt |first2=P.

More precise information regarding the exact date of the manuscript and the reasons it was produced is controversial. The testimony of the conquistador Jer\u00f3nimo L\u00f3pez, probably dating from 1547, may be relevant.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F. F. |last2=Anawalt |first2=P.

(tr. H. B. Nicholson)}}\n\nSilvio Zavala argued this the book referred to was the Codex Mendoza,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zavala |first1=Silvio |title=Las encomiendas de Nueva Espa\u00f1a y el gobierno de don Antonio de Mendoza |journal=Revista de Historia de Am\u00e9rica |date=1938 |volume=1 |pages=59\u201375}}</ref> and his arguments were restated by Federico G\u00f3mez de Orozco.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=G\u00f3mez de Orozco |first1=Federico |title=\u00bfQuien fue el autor material del C\u00f3dice Mendocino y quien su interprete? |journal=Revista Mexicana de Estudios Antropol\u00f3gicos |date=1941 |volume=5 |pages=43\u201352}}</ref> If this is the case, then the Codex was written circa 1541 ('six years ago more or less' from L\u00f3pez's recollection) and was commissioned by Mendoza. As H. B. Nicolson has pointed out, however, the description is not an exact fit for the Codex, and the identification is not certain.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F. F. |last2=Anawalt |first2=P. R. |title=Codex Mendoza |date=1992 |volume=1 |page=2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a later account by [[Samuel Purchas]], a later owner of the Codex, writing in 1625, the Spanish fleet was attacked by French [[privateer]]s, and the codex, along with the rest of the booty, taken to France.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F. F. |last2=Anawalt |first2=P. R. |title=Codex Mendoza |date=1992 |volume=1 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nIt was certainly in the possession of [[Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet]], [[cosmographer]] to King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] of France. Th\u00e9vet wrote his name in five places on the codex, twice with the date 1553. It was later owned by the Englishman [[Richard Hakluyt]]. According again to Samuel Purchase, Hakluyt bought the Codex for 20 [[French livre|French francs]]. Some time after 1616 it was passed to Samuel Purchase, then to his son, and then to [[John Selden]]. The codex was deposited into the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1659, five years after Selden's death, where it remained in obscurity until 1831, when it was rediscovered by [[Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough|Viscount Kingsborough]] and brought to the attention of scholars.\n\n==Content==\nWritten on European paper, it contains 71 pages, divided into three sections:\n*Section I, folios 1r to 17r or 18r, is a history of the Aztec people from 1325 through 1521 \u2014 from the founding of [[Tenochtitlan]] through the Spanish conquest.  It lists the reign of each ruler and the towns conquered by them. It is uncertain whether folios 17v and 18r belong to Section I or Section II.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F. F. |last2=Anawalt |first2=P. R. |title=Codex Mendoza |date=1992 |volume=1 |pages=55\u20136}}</ref>\n*Section II, folios 17v or 18v to 54v, provides a list of the towns conquered by the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] and the tributes paid by each. This section is closely related to, and probably copied from, the [[Matr\u00edcula de Tributos]], but the Codex Mendoza contains five provinces not included in the Matr\u00edcula. This probably represents material now missing from the Matr\u00edcula but present when the Codex Mendoza was copied.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Batalla Rosado |first1=J.

Arch. Selden. A. 1, as currently foliated, do not form part of the Codex Mendoza. These folios comprise an originally separate manuscript, apparently written in England in the first half of the  seventeenth century.

When the Spanish crown ordered Mendoza to provide evidence of the Aztec political and tribute system, he invited skilled artists and scribes who were being schooled at the Franciscan college in Tlatelolco, to gather in a workshop where they could recreate, under the supervision of Spanish priests, the document for himself and the [[King of Spain]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Carrasco |first=David|title=City of Sacrifice : The Aztec Empire and the Role of Violence in Civilization |date=1999 |page=19}}</ref> The beautiful and revealing pictorial document that they produced became known as the Codex Mendoza, consisting of seventy-one folios made of Spanish paper measuring 20.6 \u00d7 30.6 centimeters (8.25 \u00d7 12.25 inches). <ref>{{cite book |last=Anawalt |first=Patricia|editor-last=Carrasco |editor-first=David L.|entry=Codex Mendoza |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures :The Civilizations of Mexico and Central America vol.1|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195108156.001.0001/acref-9780195108156 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York|date=2001 |pages=72-73 |isbn=978-0-19-514255-6 |oclc=872326807}}</ref> The document is crafted in the native style, and today it is bound at the spine in the manner of European books.\n\nThe codex is also known as the '''Codex Mendocino''' and '''''La colecci\u00f3n Mendoza''''', and has been held at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]] since 1659.

More precise information regarding the exact date of the manuscript and the reasons it was produced is controversial. The testimony of the conquistador Jer\u00f3nimo L\u00f3pez, probably dating from 1547, may be relevant.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F. F. |last2=Anawalt |first2=P.

Th\u00e9vet wrote his name in five places on the codex, twice with the date 1553. It was later owned by the Englishman [[Richard Hakluyt]]. According again to Samuel Purchase, Hakluyt bought the Codex for 20 [[French livre|French francs]]. Some time after 1616 it was passed to Samuel Purchase, then to his son, and then to [[John Selden]]. The codex was deposited into the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1659, five years after Selden's death, where it remained in obscurity until 1831, when it was rediscovered by [[Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough|Viscount Kingsborough]] and brought to the attention of scholars.\n\n==Content==\nWritten on European paper, it contains 71 pages, divided into three sections:\n*Section I, folios 1r to 17r or 18r, is a history of the Aztec people from 1325 through 1521 \u2014 from the founding of [[Tenochtitlan]] through the Spanish conquest.  It lists the reign of each ruler and the towns conquered by them. It is uncertain whether folios 17v and 18r belong to Section I or Section II.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berdan |first1=F.

R. |title=Codex Mendoza |date=1992 |volume=1 |pages=55\u20136}}</ref>\n*Section II, folios 17v or 18v to 54v, provides a list of the towns conquered by the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] and the tributes paid by each. This section is closely related to, and probably copied from, the [[Matr\u00edcula de Tributos]], but the Codex Mendoza contains five provinces not included in the Matr\u00edcula. This probably represents material now missing from the Matr\u00edcula but present when the Codex Mendoza was copied.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Batalla Rosado |first1=J.

These folios comprise an originally separate manuscript, apparently written in England in the first half of the  seventeenth century.

In 2015, in the diocese of Amalfi there was one priest for every 1,199 Catholics.\n\n== Special churches ==\n[[Amalfi Cathedral]], the [[cathedral]] archiepiscopal see, is in [[Amalfi]], devoted to [[Andrew the Apostle]].\nIt also has \n* Marian [[Co-Cathedral]] dedicated to the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], in [[Cava de\u2019 Tirreni]]\n* Former Cathedral, a marian [[Minor Basilica]], dedicated to the [[Assumption of Mary]] and to St. Pantaleone, in [[Ravello]]\n* Former Cathedral, also Minor Basilica, dedicated to St. Trofimena, in [[Minori, Campania|Minori]]\n* Former Cathedral of St. Lawrence 'Duomo di S. Lorenzo', in [[Scala, Campania]]\n* Minor Basilica of Santa Maria dell\u2019Olmo, in [[Cava de\u2019 Tirreni]]\n\n== History ==\nThe early beginnings of the '''Diocese of Amalfi''' are obscure; it is not known when it was founded, or when Christianity reached it. That it was early is a reasonable conjecture, considering the facilities for communication with the East which the South of Italy possessed.\n\nThe first indication that Amalfi was a Christian community is supplied by Pope [[Gregory the Great]], who wrote in January 596 to the [[Subdeacon]] Antemius, his [[papal legate|legate]] and administrator in [[Campania]], ordering him to constrain within a [[monastery]] Primenus, Bishop of Amalfi, because he did not remain in his diocese, but [[Episcopi vagantes|roamed about]].<ref>Reg., V, xiv; cf. [[Philipp Jaff\u00e9|Jaff\u00e9]], ''Regesta Pontificum Romanorum'', 1403.</ref> The regular list of bishops began in 829.\n\nIt was raised to '''Metropolitan Archbishopric of Amalfi''' by [[Pope John XV]] in 987, having lost territory to establish the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Capri|dioceses of Capri]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lettere|of Lettere]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Minori|of Minori]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scala|of Scala]].\n\nIn 1206, it gained territory from the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nuceria]]. And after the completion, also in 1206, of the [[Cathedral]] of [[St. Andrew]] (''[[Duomo]]''), the [[relic]]s of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]] of that name, who was the [[patron saint]] of Amalfi, were taken from [[Constantinople]] and brought there by Cardinal [[Pietro of Capua]], an Amalfitan who took part in the [[sack of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].\n\nOn 10 October 1384 it lost territory to establish the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nuceria|Diocese of Nuceria]]\n\nOn 27 June 1818 it lost its status as a [[metropolitan archdiocese]] and became the '''Archdiocese of Amalfi''', despite having gained territories from the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Minori|dioceses of Minori]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ravello and Scala|of Ravello and Scala]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, archdiocese had about 36,000 inhabitants, 54 parishes and 279 diocesan priests.\n\nOn 30 September 1986 the diocese was renamed the \"Archdiocese of Amalfi\u2013Cava de\u2019 Tirreni\", having gained territory from and absorbing the title of the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cava de\u2019 Tirreni]].\n\nOn 20 August 2012 it gained territory from the [[Territorial Abbey of Santissima Trinit\u00e0 di Cava de Tirreni]].\n\n== Bishops and Archbishops ==\n\n===Diocese of Amalfi===\n''Erected: 6th Century''<br>\n''Latin Name: Amalphitana''\n\n:'''...'''\n* Pimenius (596)<ref>Pimenius is mentioned in a letter of Pope Gregory I:  Kehr, p. 388, no. 1.

In 2015, in the diocese of Amalfi there was one priest for every 1,199 Catholics.\n\n== Special churches ==\n[[Amalfi Cathedral]], the [[cathedral]] archiepiscopal see, is in [[Amalfi]], devoted to [[Andrew the Apostle]].\nIt also has \n* Marian [[Co-Cathedral]] dedicated to the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], in [[Cava de\u2019 Tirreni]]\n* Former Cathedral, a marian [[Minor Basilica]], dedicated to the [[Assumption of Mary]] and to St. Pantaleone, in [[Ravello]]\n* Former Cathedral, also Minor Basilica, dedicated to St. Trofimena, in [[Minori, Campania|Minori]]\n* Former Cathedral of St. Lawrence 'Duomo di S.

That it was early is a reasonable conjecture, considering the facilities for communication with the East which the South of Italy possessed.\n\nThe first indication that Amalfi was a Christian community is supplied by Pope [[Gregory the Great]], who wrote in January 596 to the [[Subdeacon]] Antemius, his [[papal legate|legate]] and administrator in [[Campania]], ordering him to constrain within a [[monastery]] Primenus, Bishop of Amalfi, because he did not remain in his diocese, but [[Episcopi vagantes|roamed about]].<ref>Reg., V, xiv; cf. [[Philipp Jaff\u00e9|Jaff\u00e9]], ''Regesta Pontificum Romanorum'', 1403.</ref> The regular list of bishops began in 829.\n\nIt was raised to '''Metropolitan Archbishopric of Amalfi''' by [[Pope John XV]] in 987, having lost territory to establish the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Capri|dioceses of Capri]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lettere|of Lettere]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Minori|of Minori]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scala|of Scala]].\n\nIn 1206, it gained territory from the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nuceria]]. And after the completion, also in 1206, of the [[Cathedral]] of [[St. Andrew]] (''[[Duomo]]''), the [[relic]]s of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]] of that name, who was the [[patron saint]] of Amalfi, were taken from [[Constantinople]] and brought there by Cardinal [[Pietro of Capua]], an Amalfitan who took part in the [[sack of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].\n\nOn 10 October 1384 it lost territory to establish the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nuceria|Diocese of Nuceria]]\n\nOn 27 June 1818 it lost its status as a [[metropolitan archdiocese]] and became the '''Archdiocese of Amalfi''', despite having gained territories from the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Minori|dioceses of Minori]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ravello and Scala|of Ravello and Scala]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, archdiocese had about 36,000 inhabitants, 54 parishes and 279 diocesan priests.\n\nOn 30 September 1986 the diocese was renamed the \"Archdiocese of Amalfi\u2013Cava de\u2019 Tirreni\", having gained territory from and absorbing the title of the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cava de\u2019 Tirreni]].\n\nOn 20 August 2012 it gained territory from the [[Territorial Abbey of Santissima Trinit\u00e0 di Cava de Tirreni]].\n\n== Bishops and Archbishops ==\n\n===Diocese of Amalfi===\n''Erected: 6th Century''<br>\n''Latin Name: Amalphitana''\n\n:'''...'''\n* Pimenius (596)<ref>Pimenius is mentioned in a letter of Pope Gregory I:  Kehr, p. 388, no. 1.

During this festival that occurs on the sixth month, the people of Enegi make offerings to kings and priestesses who have passes.
