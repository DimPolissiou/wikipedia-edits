It became the capital and most important city in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Following the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], it became the capital of the Republic of Peru (Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa). Around one-third of the national population lives in the [[Lima Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]].\n\nLima is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The [[National University of San Marcos]], founded on 12 May 1551, during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Spanish colonial empire]], is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas.\n\nNowadays the city is considered as the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of the country. Internationally, it is one of the [[List of urban areas by population|thirty most populated urban agglomerations in the world]]. Due to its geostrategic importance, it has been defined as a \"beta\" city.\n\nJurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller portion, to the west, within the constitutional province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Ch\u00e1vez airport are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.\n\nIn October 2013, Lima was chosen to host the [[2019 Pan American Games]], these games were held at venues in and around Lima, and were the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country. It also hosted the [[APEC]] Meetings of 2008 and 2016, the [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] in October 2015,  the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in December 2014, and the [[Miss Universe 1982]] contest.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Lima foundation.jpg|thumb|Lima Foundation by Francisco Pizarro (1535)|alt=|left]]\n\nAccording to early Spanish articles the Lima area was once called ''Itchyma'', after its original inhabitants. However, even before the [[Inca]] occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the R\u00edmac valley had come to be known by visitors as ''Limaq'' ('''Limaq''', pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8li.m\u0251q|}}, which means \"talker\" or \"speaker\" in the [[Quechua II|coastal Quechua]] that was the area's primary language before the Spanish arrival). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted: the chronicles show \"L\u00edmac\" replacing \"Ychma\" as the common name for the area.<ref name=\"Limaq\">{{cite web|url=http://aymara.org/biblio/lima_etimologia.pdf|title=Limaq|accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nModern scholars speculate that the word \"Lima\" originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects [[stop consonant]]s in word-final position. Non-Peruvian Spanish speakers may mistakenly define the city name as the direct Spanish translation of \"[[Lime (fruit)|lime]]\", the citrus fruit.\n[[File:CATEDRAL DE LIMA (FISQUET 1846).jpg|thumb|Lima Cathedral in 1846]]\n\nThe city was founded in 1535 under the name City of [[Biblical Magi|Kings]] ({{Lang-es|link=no|Ciudad de los Reyes}}) because its foundation was decided on 6 January, date of the feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. This name quickly fell into disuse, and ''Lima'' became the city's name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both ''Lima'' and ''Ciudad de los Reyes'' can be seen together.\n\nThe river that feeds Lima is called ''R\u00edmac'' and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is \"Talking River\" (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua in which the word for \"talker\" was pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8rim\u0251q|}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701034625/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |archive-date=2015-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the [[Cusco|Cuzco]] nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of [[Cusco Quechua|Cuzco Quechua]].\n\nLater, as the original inhabitants died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. Nowadays, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.<ref name=\"Limaq\" />\n\n==Symbols==\n===Flag===\nHistorically, the [[Flag of Lima]] has been known as the \"Banner of Peru's Kings' City\".<ref name=\"flag\">{{cite web|url=http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |title=Ciudad de Lima |editor=Heralatin.t35.com |access-date=11 February 2015 |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810152715/http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref> It is made from a golden-colored silk canvas and embroidered in the center is its coat of arms.<ref name=\"flag\"/>\n\n===Anthem===\nLima's anthem was heard for the first time on 18 January 2008, in a formal meeting with important politicians, including [[List of Presidents of Peru|Peruvian President]] [[Alan Garc\u00eda]], and other authorities.

These are locally called 'gar\u00faa', 'llovizna' or '[[camanchaca]]s'. Summer rain, on the other hand, is infrequent and occurs in the form of isolated light and brief showers. These generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from Andean storms arrive from the east. The lack of heavy rainfall arises from high atmospheric stability caused, in turn, by the combination of cool waters from semi-permanent coastal upwelling and the presence of the cold [[Humboldt Current]] and warm air aloft associated with the South Pacific anticyclone.\n\nLima's climate (like that of most of coastal Peru) gets severely disrupted in [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]] events.

They organized social clubs and built their own schools. Examples are [[Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The American School of Lima|The American-Peruvian school]], the [[Alliance fran\u00e7aise|Alianza Francesa de Lima]], the Lyc\u00e9e Franco-P\u00e9ruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; [[Markham College]], the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, [[Antonio Raymondi District]] Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also, several German-Peruvian schools.\n\nChinese and a lesser number of Japanese came to Lima and established themselves in the [[Barrios Altos]] neighborhood in downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their [[Chinatown, Lima|Chinatown]] as ''Calle Capon'' and the city's ubiquitous [[Chifa]] restaurants{{spaced ndash}}small, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisine{{spaced ndash}}can be found by the dozens in this enclave.\n\nIn 2014, the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica) reported that the population in Lima's 49 districts was 9,752,000 people, including the Constitutional Province of Callao. The city and (metropolitan area) represents around 29% of the national population. Of the city's population 48.7% are men and 51.3% are women. The 49 districts in Metropolitan Lima are divided into 5 areas: Cono Norte (North Lima), Lima Este (East Lima), Constitutional Province of Callao, Lima Centro (Central Lima) and Lima Sur (South Lima). The largest areas are Lima Norte with 2,475,432 people and Lima Este with 2,619,814 people, including the largest single district San Juan de Lurigancho, which hosts 1 million people.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\" />\n\nLima is considered a \"young\" city. According to INEI, by mid 2014 the age distribution in Lima was: 24.3% between 0 and 14, 27.2% between 15 and 29, 22.5% between 30 and 44, 15.4% between 45 and 59 and 10.6% above 60.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nMigration to Lima from the rest of Peru is substantial. In 2013, 3,480,000 people reported arriving from other regions. This represents almost 36% of the entire population of Metropolitan Lima. The three regions that supply most of the migrants are Junin, Ancash and Ayacucho. By contrast only 390,000 emigrated from Lima to other regions.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nThe annual population growth rate is 1.57%. Some of the 43 metropolitan districts are considerably more populous than others. For example, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Ate, Comas, Villa El Salvador and Villa Maria del Triunfo host more than 400,000, while San Luis, San Isidro, Magdalena del Mar, Lince and Barranco have less than 60,000 residents.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nA 2005 household survey study shows a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6,000 soles (around US$1,840) or more for socioeconomic level A; between 2,000 soles (US$612) and 6,000 soles (US$1,840) for level B; from 840 soles (US$257) to 2,000 soles (US$612) for level C; from 420 soles (US$128) to 1200 soles (US$368) for level D; and up to 840 soles (US$257) for level E. In Lima, 18% were in level E; 32.3% in level D; 31.7% in level C; 14.6% in level B; and 3.4% in level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 soles (or US$612) monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apeim.com.pe/wp-content/themes/apeim/docs/nse/APEIM-NSE-2003-2004-LIMA.pdf|title=Niveles socioecon\u00f3micos en Lima Metropolitana y Callao \u2013 APEIM |trans-title=Socioeconomic levels in Metropolitan Lima and Callao \u2013 APEIM |publisher=Asociaci\u00f3n Peruana de Empresas de Investigaci\u00f3n de Mercados|language=es|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the percentage of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The level of poverty is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The level of poverty has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%).

The younger population (ages 15 to 29 years old) has the highest victimization rate (47.9%).<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/> In 2012, citizens reported thefts (47.9%): in homes or establishments (19.4%), robbery or attack (14.9%), gang aggression (5.7%), among others in lesser frequency. The districts with the highest level of victimization are Rimac, El Agustino, Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos. The safest districts by level of victimization are Lurin, Lurigancho-Chosica, San Borja, Magdalena and Surquillo. These districts do not necessarily correspond to the districts with highest or lowest perception of insecurity.<ref name=\"ciudadnuestra.org\"/>\n\nWhile the Police force is nationally controlled and funded, each district in Lima has a community policing structure called Serenazgo. The quantity of Serenazgos officials and resources varies by district. For example, Villa Maria del Triunfo has 5,785 citizens per official. Twenty-two districts in Lima have a ratio above 1000 citizens per Serenazgo official, while 14 districts have ratios below 200 citizens per official, including Miraflores with 119 and San Isidro with 57.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nThe satisfaction with the Serenazgos also varies greatly by district. The highest satisfaction rates can be found in San Isidro (88.3%), Miraflores (81.6%), San Borja (77%) and Surco (75%). The lowest satisfaction rates can be found in Villa Maria del Triunfo (11%), San Juan de Miraflores (14.8%), Rimac (16.3%) and La Victoria (20%).<ref name=\"ciudadnuestra.org\"/>\n\n==Notable people from Lima==\n{{See also|List of people from Lima}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n[[File:Santa_Rosa_de_Lima_Ebrafol.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Rosa de Lima|St. Rose of Lima]] 1586\u20131617]]\n||\n[[File:San Martin de Porres huaycan.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[St. Martin de Porres]], 1579\u20131639]]\n||\n[[File:Palma1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Ricardo Palma]], writer, 1833\u20131919]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Mario Testino.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Mario Testino]], celebrity photographer]]\n||\n[[File:Gaston acurio.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gaston Acurio]], Chef of Peruvian Cuisine]]\n||\n[[File:Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (1982).jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], Former UN Secretary General]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Carlos Noriega.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Carlos Noriega]], US-Peruvian Astronaut]]\n||\n[[File:Bayly Jaime IMGP3054.JPG|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Jaime Bayly]], journalist]]\n||\n[[File:Christian Meier in 2 October 2015.png|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Christian Meier]], Peruvian actor]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Gian Marco.png|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gian Marco Zignago]] Singer, Songwriter]]\n||\n[[File:Gise 6gala.png|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gisela Valcarcel]] Television Hostess]]\n||\n[[File:Florez Juan Diego-4300 (16960810518) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Juan Diego Florez]], Tenor Opera Singer]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Eva ayllon 2010.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Eva Ayllon]], AfroPeruvian Singer]]\n||\n[[File:Claudia Llosa (111).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Claudia Llosa]], film director, writer and producer.]]\n|}\n\n*[[Rose of Lima]] (First Catholic in the Americas to be declared a saint)\n*[[Martin de Porres]] (Patron saint of mixed-race people)\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Baqu\u00edjano y Carrillo, Count of Vistaflorida]] (Economist, jurist, writer and politician of the Viceroyalty of Peru)\n*[[Francisco Antonio de Zela]] (Revolutionary against Spanish domination)\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Olaya]] (Afro-Peruvian hero)\n*[[Ricardo Palma]] (Writer)\n*[[Jose de la Riva Aguero]] (First Head State of Peru)\n*[[Mario Testino]] (Celebrity Photographer)\n*[[Gaston Acurio]] (Chef Ambassador of Peruvian Cuisine)\n*[[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peruvian writer \u2013 Nobel Prize winner of literature)\n*[[Juan Diego Florez]] (Opera Singer \u2013 Tenor)\n*[[Carlos Noriega]] (NASA Astronaut)\n*[[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] (Diplomat, Politician and former UN Secretary General)\n*[[Eva Ayllon]] (Afro-Peruvian Singer)\n*[[Paolo Guerrero]] (Soccer player)\n*[[Saby Kamalich]] (Actress)\n*[[Christian Meier]] (Actor, singer, model, businessman)\n*[[Jaime Cuadra]] (Music producer, composer, singer and voiceover artist)\n*[[Mar\u00eda Rostworowski]] (Historian)\n*[[Fernando de Szyszlo]] (Painter, Sculptor)\n*[[Jaime Bayly]] (Writer, Journalist)\n*[[Gian Marco Zignago]] (Singer-Songwriter)\n*[[Iv\u00e1n Thays]] (Author, professor and television host)\n*[[Luis Llosa]] (Film Director)\n*[[Jefferson Farfan]] (Soccer player)\n*[[Madeleine Truel]] (French-Peruvian who helped people from Nazis)\n*[[Gisela Valcarcel]] (Television hostess)\n*[[Alex Valle]] (Peruvian American professional fighting game player)\n*[[Valentina Shevchenko (fighter)|Valentina Shevchenko]] (Kyrgyzstani-Peruvian Mixed Martial Artist fighting out of Lima)\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in South America}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities===\nLima is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>Sister Cities International, [http://www.sister-cities.org/icrc/directory/Americas/Peru Online Directory: Peru, Americas].

It is located in the valleys of the [[Chill\u00f3n River|Chill\u00f3n]], [[R\u00edmac River|R\u00edmac]] and [[Lur\u00edn River|Lur\u00edn]] rivers, in the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Together with the seaport of [[Callao]], it forms a contiguous urban area known as the [[Lima Metropolitan Area]]. With a population of more than 9 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.inei.gob.pe/prensa/noticias/lima-alberga-9-millones-320-mil-habitantes-al-2018-10521/ |title=Lima alberga 9 millones 320 mil habitantes al 2018 |website=inei.gob.pe |publisher=INEI |language=es |accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref> Lima is the most populous [[List of metropolitan areas of Peru|metropolitan area of Peru]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|seventh-largest metropolitan area in the Americas]].\n\nLima was named by natives in the agricultural region known by native Peruvians as Limaq, a name that it had acquired over time. It became the capital and most important city in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Following the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], it became the capital of the Republic of Peru (Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa). Around one-third of the national population lives in the [[Lima Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]].\n\nLima is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The [[National University of San Marcos]], founded on 12 May 1551, during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Spanish colonial empire]], is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas.\n\nNowadays the city is considered as the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of the country. Internationally, it is one of the [[List of urban areas by population|thirty most populated urban agglomerations in the world]]. Due to its geostrategic importance, it has been defined as a \"beta\" city.\n\nJurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller portion, to the west, within the constitutional province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Ch\u00e1vez airport are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.\n\nIn October 2013, Lima was chosen to host the [[2019 Pan American Games]], these games were held at venues in and around Lima, and were the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country. It also hosted the [[APEC]] Meetings of 2008 and 2016, the [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] in October 2015,  the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in December 2014, and the [[Miss Universe 1982]] contest.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Lima foundation.jpg|thumb|Lima Foundation by Francisco Pizarro (1535)|alt=|left]]\n\nAccording to early Spanish articles the Lima area was once called ''Itchyma'', after its original inhabitants. However, even before the [[Inca]] occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the R\u00edmac valley had come to be known by visitors as ''Limaq'' ('''Limaq''', pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8li.m\u0251q|}}, which means \"talker\" or \"speaker\" in the [[Quechua II|coastal Quechua]] that was the area's primary language before the Spanish arrival). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted: the chronicles show \"L\u00edmac\" replacing \"Ychma\" as the common name for the area.<ref name=\"Limaq\">{{cite web|url=http://aymara.org/biblio/lima_etimologia.pdf|title=Limaq|accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nModern scholars speculate that the word \"Lima\" originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects [[stop consonant]]s in word-final position. Non-Peruvian Spanish speakers may mistakenly define the city name as the direct Spanish translation of \"[[Lime (fruit)|lime]]\", the citrus fruit.\n[[File:CATEDRAL DE LIMA (FISQUET 1846).jpg|thumb|Lima Cathedral in 1846]]\n\nThe city was founded in 1535 under the name City of [[Biblical Magi|Kings]] ({{Lang-es|link=no|Ciudad de los Reyes}}) because its foundation was decided on 6 January, date of the feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. This name quickly fell into disuse, and ''Lima'' became the city's name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both ''Lima'' and ''Ciudad de los Reyes'' can be seen together.\n\nThe river that feeds Lima is called ''R\u00edmac'' and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is \"Talking River\" (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua in which the word for \"talker\" was pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8rim\u0251q|}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701034625/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |archive-date=2015-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the [[Cusco|Cuzco]] nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of [[Cusco Quechua|Cuzco Quechua]].\n\nLater, as the original inhabitants died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. Nowadays, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.<ref name=\"Limaq\" />\n\n==Symbols==\n===Flag===\nHistorically, the [[Flag of Lima]] has been known as the \"Banner of Peru's Kings' City\".<ref name=\"flag\">{{cite web|url=http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |title=Ciudad de Lima |editor=Heralatin.t35.com |access-date=11 February 2015 |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810152715/http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref> It is made from a golden-colored silk canvas and embroidered in the center is its coat of arms.<ref name=\"flag\"/>\n\n===Anthem===\nLima's anthem was heard for the first time on 18 January 2008, in a formal meeting with important politicians, including [[List of Presidents of Peru|Peruvian President]] [[Alan Garc\u00eda]], and other authorities.

They organized social clubs and built their own schools. Examples are [[Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The American School of Lima|The American-Peruvian school]], the [[Alliance fran\u00e7aise|Alianza Francesa de Lima]], the Lyc\u00e9e Franco-P\u00e9ruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; [[Markham College]], the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, [[Antonio Raymondi District]] Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also, several German-Peruvian schools.\n\nChinese and a lesser number of Japanese came to Lima and established themselves in the [[Barrios Altos]] neighborhood in downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their [[Chinatown, Lima|Chinatown]] as ''Calle Capon'' and the city's ubiquitous [[Chifa]] restaurants{{spaced ndash}}small, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisine{{spaced ndash}}can be found by the dozens in this enclave.\n\nIn 2014, the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica) reported that the population in Lima's 49 districts was 9,752,000 people, including the Constitutional Province of Callao. The city and (metropolitan area) represents around 29% of the national population. Of the city's population 48.7% are men and 51.3% are women. The 49 districts in Metropolitan Lima are divided into 5 areas: Cono Norte (North Lima), Lima Este (East Lima), Constitutional Province of Callao, Lima Centro (Central Lima) and Lima Sur (South Lima). The largest areas are Lima Norte with 2,475,432 people and Lima Este with 2,619,814 people, including the largest single district San Juan de Lurigancho, which hosts 1 million people.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\" />\n\nLima is considered a \"young\" city. According to INEI, by mid 2014 the age distribution in Lima was: 24.3% between 0 and 14, 27.2% between 15 and 29, 22.5% between 30 and 44, 15.4% between 45 and 59 and 10.6% above 60.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nMigration to Lima from the rest of Peru is substantial. In 2013, 3,480,000 people reported arriving from other regions. This represents almost 36% of the entire population of Metropolitan Lima. The three regions that supply most of the migrants are Junin, Ancash and Ayacucho. By contrast only 390,000 emigrated from Lima to other regions.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nThe annual population growth rate is 1.57%. Some of the 43 metropolitan districts are considerably more populous than others. For example, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Ate, Comas, Villa El Salvador and Villa Maria del Triunfo host more than 400,000, while San Luis, San Isidro, Magdalena del Mar, Lince and Barranco have less than 60,000 residents.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nA 2005 household survey study shows a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6,000 soles (around US$1,840) or more for socioeconomic level A; between 2,000 soles (US$612) and 6,000 soles (US$1,840) for level B; from 840 soles (US$257) to 2,000 soles (US$612) for level C; from 420 soles (US$128) to 1200 soles (US$368) for level D; and up to 840 soles (US$257) for level E. In Lima, 18% were in level E; 32.3% in level D; 31.7% in level C; 14.6% in level B; and 3.4% in level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 soles (or US$612) monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apeim.com.pe/wp-content/themes/apeim/docs/nse/APEIM-NSE-2003-2004-LIMA.pdf|title=Niveles socioecon\u00f3micos en Lima Metropolitana y Callao \u2013 APEIM |trans-title=Socioeconomic levels in Metropolitan Lima and Callao \u2013 APEIM |publisher=Asociaci\u00f3n Peruana de Empresas de Investigaci\u00f3n de Mercados|language=es|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the percentage of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The level of poverty is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The level of poverty has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%).

The highway extends {{convert|1450|km|mi|sp=us}} to the border with Chile.\n\nThe city has one big bus terminal next to the mall Plaza Norte. This bus station is the point of departure and arrival point for national and international destinations. Other bus stations serve private bus companies around the city. In addition, informal bus stations are located in the south, center and north of the city.\n\n===Maritime===\n[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Port of [[Callao]].]]\nLima's proximity to the port of [[Callao]] allows Callao to act as the metropolitan area's major port and one of Latin America's largest.

In January 2014, the concentration of minerals in water treatment facilities of SEDAPAL was 0.051 iron, 0.005 lead, 0.0012 cadmium and 0.0810 aluminum. These values increased 15.9% and 33.3% in iron and cadmium with respect to January 2013 and a decrease of 16.7% and 12.4% in lead and aluminum. The values are within the recommended limits.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Solid waste====\nThe amount of solid waste produced per capita in Lima is about {{convert|0.7|kg|0|abbr=on}} per day. In 2012, each resident produced {{convert|273.36|kg|0|abbr=on}} of solid waste. The district municipalities only collect about 67% of the solid waste they generate. The rest ends up in informal landfills, rivers, or the ocean. Three municipalities recycle 20% or more of their waste.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\n===Access to basic services===\nIn Lima, 93% of households have access to water supply in their homes.

Within its boundaries are the [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] of the [[Seneca Nation of New York]], and the [[Allegany State Park]]. The [[Allegheny River]] runs through the county.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cattaraugus County, New York, United States.jpg|thumb|right|Entering Cattaraugus County on [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania\u2013New York)|Interstate 86]]]]\nThe largely unsettled territory was the traditional homeland of the now-extinct [[Wenrohronon]] Indians and later occupied by the Seneca people, one of the five Nations of the Haudenosaunee. During the colonial era, it was claimed by at least three territories: [[New York Colony]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], and [[Pennsylvania Colony]], each of which extended their colonial claims to the west until after the Revolutionary War.\n\nWhen counties were established in the province of New York in 1683, the territory of Cattaraugus County was included within the very large [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York as well as all of the present state of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. As additional areas were settled, this county was reduced on July 3, 1766 by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]. The county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County is represented in the 21st century by 37 counties of New York. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled across the [[Niagara Frontier]] into modern day [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] (and a treaty with Massachusetts that finally settled who owned Western New York), the name of Tryon County was changed to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] in honor of the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]]. This replaced the name of the hated British governor.\n\nIn practice, however, these counties did not cover modern Cattaraugus County or Western New York. Most of that area lay within the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] established in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] by the British; it was intended to be reserved for Native Americans and was ruled off-limits to European settlement.\n\nThe newly independent United States sought to extinguish native reserves after the British ceded their territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes to the United States. This included Iroquois territory in New York; the four nations that had been allies of the British mostly relocated to Ontario, where the Crown gave them land grants in some compensation for losses. The [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], in 1794, extinguished what was left of native title, with the exception of several reservations, three of which were at least partially located in what is now Cattaraugus County.\n\n[[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] was split from Montgomery County in 1789 as a result of the establishment of the [[Morris Reserve]]. In turn, [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] was split from Ontario County in 1802 as a result of the [[Holland Purchase]]. This period was the beginning of more significant European-American settlement of this western territory. Shortly afterward, Genesee County was reduced in 1806 by the creation of [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]].\n\nCattaraugus County was formed in 1808, split off from Genesee County. At first there was no county government due to the sparse population. From 1812 to 1814, Cattaraugus County was incorporated in Allegany County; from 1814 to 1817, records of the county were divided between [[Belmont, New York|Belmont]] (Allegany County) and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] (then in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]]). The name \"Cattaraugus\"  derives from a [[Seneca language|Seneca]] word for \"bad smelling banks,\" and was named for the \"odor of natural gas leaking from rock seams.\" <ref name=DOS>{{cite web|title=The Origins of New York State's County Names|url=http://www.dos.ny.gov/info/pdfs/countynames.pdf|website=New York State Department of State|accessdate=10 April 2015|ref=DOS}}</ref> In 1817, a county government was established for Cattaraugus County in the southwestern corner of the town of Hebe, now [[Ellicottville (village), New York|Ellicottville]].\n\nNumerous towns in the county are named after agents of the Holland Land Company, including Ellicottville ([[Joseph Ellicott]]), Franklinville ([[William Temple Franklin]], a speculator and grandson of [[Benjamin Franklin]]), and Otto and East Otto ([[Jacob Otto]]). The first settlement in the county was in [[Olean (city), New York|Olean]]. After 1860, in response to the construction of a railroad (where the [[Pat McGee Trail]] is now), the county seat was moved to Little Valley.\n\nThe [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] is within the county boundaries and is one of two controlled by the federally recognized [[Seneca Nation of New York]] in the western part of the state; the Seneca's other territories, [[Cattaraugus Reservation, Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] and [[Oil Springs Reservation|Oil Springs]], are both partially within county boundaries.

It is noticeably more rugged than neighboring areas that had peaks rounded and valleys filled by the glacier. The entire area is a [[dissected plateau]] of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Mississippian age]], but appears mountainous to the casual observer.\n\nThe plateau is an extension of the [[Allegany Plateau]] from nearby Pennsylvania. Southern Cattaraugus County is part of the same [[oil field]], and [[petroleum]] was formerly a resource of the area. It is now mostly played out, but [[natural gas]] continues to be extracted.\n\nA [[continental divide]] between the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Great Lakes]] watersheds runs through Cattaraugus County\n\nThe northern border of the county is formed by [[Cattaraugus Creek]] and the Allegheny River flows through the county.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] - north\n* [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming County]] - northeast\n* [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]] - east\n* [[McKean County, Pennsylvania|McKean County]], [[Pennsylvania]] - southeast\n* [[Warren County, Pennsylvania|Warren County]], [[Pennsylvania]] - southwest\n* [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]] - west\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{jct|state=NY|I|86|NY|17|STE}}\n* [[Image:US 62.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 62]]\n* [[Image:US 219.svg|22px]] [[U.S. Route 219]]\n* [[Image:NY-16.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 16]]\n* [[Image:NY-98.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 98]]\n* [[Image:NY-240.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 240]]\n* [[Image:NY-242.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 242]]\n* [[Image:NY-353.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 353]]\n* [[Image:NY-417.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 417]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{see also|list of county routes in Cattaraugus County, New York}}\n\n===Airports===\n[[Great Valley Airport]] is located in Cattaraugus County, one nautical mile (1.85&nbsp;km) southeast of the [[central business district]] of [[Great Valley, New York|Great Valley]].<ref>{{FAA-airport|ID=N56|use=PU|own=PR|site=15344.*A}}.

[[Trailways]] offers a once-daily north-to-south run between Buffalo and points south in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe county does not have a unified public transit system. The Seneca Nation serves much of the county through its own bus line, which connects its reservations; another service, the Olean Area Transit System, connects the cities of Salamanca and Olean.\n\n===Rail===\nThere is no regular passenger rail service in Cattaraugus County; [[Amtrak]] does not serve the county. The [[Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (2001)|WNY & PA Railroad]], based in Olean, provides freight service on most of the rail routes in Cattaraugus County; the [[New York and Lake Erie Railroad]] serves the northwest corner and the [[Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad]] runs a north-to-south route.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 4090\n|1830= 16724\n|1840= 28872\n|1850= 38950\n|1860= 43886\n|1870= 43909\n|1880= 55806\n|1890= 60866\n|1900= 65643\n|1910= 65919\n|1920= 71323\n|1930= 72398\n|1940= 72652\n|1950= 77901\n|1960= 80187\n|1970= 81666\n|1980= 85697\n|1990= 84234\n|2000= 83955\n|2010= 80343\n|estyear=2019\n|estimate=76117\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ny190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

The county uses a system of [[proportional representation]] in which each legislator's vote is weighted to the number of persons in their district; each district can have between one and three legislators. This system was imposed in the 1960s in the wake of the [[one man, one vote]] federal court rulings of the era; prior to this, the county operated under a true board of supervisors model. There are currently 21 members of the legislature with 15 Republicans and 6 Democrats; the county is in the process of reducing that number to 17. Each legislator serves a four-year term, with a limit of three terms.\n\nA majority of the county council are Republicans, and only two years in the entire history of the county legislature (1992 to 1994) have seen the Democrats in the majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/news/longtime-cattaraugus-county-legislator-joseph-k-eade-dies/article_ec217d20-3553-11e8-baa1-3f3613d09623.html|title=Longtime Cattaraugus County legislator Joseph K.

In the last of these, Cattaraugus County's votes proved pivotal in the 2008 elections: incumbent Republican [[Randy Kuhl]], who had strongly carried the county in 2004 and 2006, lost Cattaraugus County to Democrat [[Eric Massa]] in the 2008 elections.\n\nThe county is generally considered a \u201cred county,\u201d with Republicans usually outvoting Democrats in most statewide and national offices (for instance, in 2004 [[George W. Bush]] defeated [[John Kerry]] in Cattaraugus County by a 60\u201340 margin) although [[Bill Clinton]] won Cattaraugus County very narrowly in 1996. In 2006, the county narrowly chose [[Eliot Spitzer]] over [[John Faso]] by a margin of about 1 percent in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|the governor's race]], and [[Hillary Clinton]] defeated [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]] in the county by a 10 percentage point margin. (That being said, in all other positions up for office that year, Republicans won\u2014including all congressional and state legislature representatives.)\n\nIn 2008 the county voted for the Republican presidential candidate, with [[John McCain]] defeating [[Barack Obama]] by a 55-44% margin. In 2010, Republican [[Carl Paladino]] carried Cattaraugus County over Democrat (and eventual winner) [[Andrew Cuomo]] 65% to 31%. Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] and Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], both incumbent Democrats, carried the county by 51% to 46% and 54% to 43% margins, respectively. Despite largely being a non-factor in heavily Democratic New York's statewide elections, the county regularly has unusually high turnout for Presidential elections, with upwards of 70 percent of eligible voters typically voting in the county.\n\nAn emerging trend among Cattaraugus County's villages has been consolidation with their surrounding towns. [[Limestone, New York|Limestone]] voters approved dissolution into the [[Carrollton, New York|Town of Carrollton]] in September 2009; that took effect at the beginning of 2011. On March 18, 2010, three other villages ([[East Randolph, New York|East Randolph]], [[Randolph (CDP), New York|Randolph]] and [[Perrysburg (CDP), New York|Perrysburg]]) followed suit and approved dissolution into their surrounding towns ([[Randolph (town), New York|Town of Randolph]] for the first two, and [[Perrysburg (town), New York|Town of Perrysburg]] for the third); these three villages dissolved at the beginning of 2012.\n\n==Additional facts==\nTwo geological formations, both called \"Rock City,\" have the appearance of a town laid out with streets. One is in [[Olean (town), New York|Olean]] and the other is in [[Little Valley (town), New York|Little Valley]].\n\n[[Olean (city), New York|Olean]] is the largest city in the county and is the major center for business. [[Ski country]] runs through Cattaraugus County; two ski resorts, popular with Canadians, lie in the town of [[Ellicottville (town), New York|Ellicottville]]: [[Holiday Valley Resort]] and HoliMont; Cattaraugus County once had numerous ski resorts within its bounds, scattered throughout the county, before contracting into Ellicottville alone by 1980. In addition, several snowmobile trails cross the county, including the [[Pat McGee Trail]], a flagship for the county's trail system, and the [[North Country Trail]].\n\nCattaraugus County's current promotional nickname is the ''Enchanted Mountains.'' The county's heights are mostly described as hills; it has only two comparatively small \"mountains\" (Mount Seneca and Mount Tuscarora, both in [[Allegany State Park]]). During the 1980s, the county used the slogan ''Naturally Yours to Enjoy.''\n\nCattaraugus County is considered part of [[Appalachia]], as well as [[Western New York]], [[upstate New York]], the [[Southern Tier]], the [[Twin Tiers]] and the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Buffalo-Niagara-Cattaraugus Combined Statistical Area]]. As a result of being at a geographic crossroads, the people of Cattaraugus County speak a variety of accents, ranging from mild variants of [[Appalachian English]] to [[Inland Northern American English]], with a handful of people speaking in the more loud and nasal [[Buffalo English]].\n\nThe sales tax in Cattaraugus County is 8% (4% from New York, 4% from the county).\n\nA large [[Amish]] community is located in the western part of the county; with an estimated 2,500 residents, they constitute slightly under 3% of the county's population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/olean/health-officials-worry-about-cattaraugus-county-s-amish-amidst-u/article_ff2d5d95-b875-5c95-bcf3-b156b70c522a.html|title=Health officials worry about Cattaraugus County's Amish amidst U.S. measles outbreak|first=RICK MILLER Olean Times|last=Herald|website=Olean Times Herald|accessdate=Jan 30, 2020}}</ref> A portion of this community maintains an exceptionally older order that eschews indoor plumbing, which, combined with a small number of Seneca who still live on traditional subsistence, gives the county a high rate of homes without indoor plumbing compared to nearby counties.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/23/1-6-million-americans-dont-have-indoor-plumbing-heres-where-they-live/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost \"1.6 million Americans don't have indoor plumbing.

Within its boundaries are the [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] of the [[Seneca Nation of New York]], and the [[Allegany State Park]]. The [[Allegheny River]] runs through the county.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cattaraugus County, New York, United States.jpg|thumb|right|Entering Cattaraugus County on [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania\u2013New York)|Interstate 86]]]]\nThe largely unsettled territory was the traditional homeland of the now-extinct [[Wenrohronon]] Indians and later occupied by the Seneca people, one of the five Nations of the Haudenosaunee. During the colonial era, it was claimed by at least three territories: [[New York Colony]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and [[Pennsylvania Colony]], each of which extended their colonial claims to the west until after the Revolutionary War.\n\nWhen counties were established in the province of New York in 1683, the territory of Cattaraugus County was included within the very large [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York as well as all of the present state of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. As additional areas were settled, this county was reduced on July 3, 1766 by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]. The county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County is represented in the 21st century by 37 counties of New York. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled across the [[Niagara Frontier]] into modern day [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] (and a treaty with Massachusetts that finally settled who owned Western New York), the name of Tryon County was changed to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] in honor of the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]]. This replaced the name of the hated British governor.\n\nIn practice, however, these counties did not cover modern Cattaraugus County or Western New York. Most of that area lay within the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] established in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] by the British; it was intended to be reserved for Native Americans and was ruled off-limits to European settlement.\n\nThe newly independent United States sought to extinguish native reserves after the British ceded their territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes to the United States. This included Iroquois territory in New York; the four nations that had been allies of the British mostly relocated to Ontario, where the Crown gave them land grants in some compensation for losses. The [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], in 1794, extinguished what was left of native title, with the exception of several reservations, three of which were at least partially located in what is now Cattaraugus County.\n\n[[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] was split from Montgomery County in 1789 as a result of the establishment of the [[Morris Reserve]]. In turn, [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] was split from Ontario County in 1802 as a result of the [[Holland Purchase]]. This period was the beginning of more significant European-American settlement of this western territory. Shortly afterward, Genesee County was reduced in 1806 by the creation of [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]].\n\nCattaraugus County was formed in 1808, split off from Genesee County. At first there was no county government due to the sparse population. From 1812 to 1814, Cattaraugus County was incorporated in Allegany County; from 1814 to 1817, records of the county were divided between [[Belmont, New York|Belmont]] (Allegany County) and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] (then in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]]). The name \"Cattaraugus\"  derives from a [[Seneca language|Seneca]] word for \"bad smelling banks,\" and was named for the \"odor of natural gas leaking from rock seams.\" <ref name=DOS>{{cite web|title=The Origins of New York State's County Names|url=http://www.dos.ny.gov/info/pdfs/countynames.pdf|website=New York State Department of State|accessdate=10 April 2015|ref=DOS}}</ref> In 1817, a county government was established for Cattaraugus County in the southwestern corner of the town of Hebe, now [[Ellicottville (village), New York|Ellicottville]].\n\nNumerous towns in the county are named after agents of the Holland Land Company, including Ellicottville ([[Joseph Ellicott]]), Franklinville ([[William Temple Franklin]], a speculator and grandson of [[Benjamin Franklin]]), and Otto and East Otto ([[Jacob Otto]]). The first settlement in the county was in [[Olean (city), New York|Olean]]. After 1860, in response to the construction of a railroad (where the [[Pat McGee Trail]] is now), the county seat was moved to Little Valley.\n\nThe [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] is within the county boundaries and is one of two controlled by the federally recognized [[Seneca Nation of New York]] in the western part of the state; the Seneca's other territories, [[Cattaraugus Reservation, Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] and [[Oil Springs Reservation|Oil Springs]], are both partially within county boundaries. South of [[Salamanca, New York]], a small city located within the reservation, is [[Allegany State Park]], which is contiguous with the [[Allegheny National Forest]] in [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1322|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1308|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|14|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 19, 2014 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}</ref>\n\nCattaraugus County is in the southwestern part of the state, immediately north of the [[Pennsylvania]] border. The southern part of Cattaraugus County is the only area of western New York that was not covered by the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]] glaciation . It is noticeably more rugged than neighboring areas that had peaks rounded and valleys filled by the glacier. The entire area is a [[dissected plateau]] of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Mississippian age]], but appears mountainous to the casual observer.\n\nThe plateau is an extension of the [[Allegany Plateau]] from nearby Pennsylvania. Southern Cattaraugus County is part of the same [[oil field]], and [[petroleum]] was formerly a resource of the area. It is now mostly played out, but [[natural gas]] continues to be extracted.\n\nA [[continental divide]] between the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Great Lakes]] watersheds runs through Cattaraugus County\n\nThe northern border of the county is formed by [[Cattaraugus Creek]] and the Allegheny River flows through the county.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] - north\n* [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming County]] - northeast\n* [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]] - east\n* [[McKean County, Pennsylvania|McKean County]], [[Pennsylvania]] - southeast\n* [[Warren County, Pennsylvania|Warren County]], [[Pennsylvania]] - southwest\n* [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]] - west\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{jct|state=NY|I|86|NY|17|STE}}\n* [[Image:US 62.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 62]]\n* [[Image:US 219.svg|22px]] [[U.S. Route 219]]\n* [[Image:NY-16.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 16]]\n* [[Image:NY-98.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 98]]\n* [[Image:NY-240.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 240]]\n* [[Image:NY-242.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 242]]\n* [[Image:NY-353.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 353]]\n* [[Image:NY-417.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 417]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{see also|list of county routes in Cattaraugus County, New York}}\n\n===Airports===\n[[Great Valley Airport]] is located in Cattaraugus County, one nautical mile (1.85&nbsp;km) southeast of the [[central business district]] of [[Great Valley, New York|Great Valley]].<ref>{{FAA-airport|ID=N56|use=PU|own=PR|site=15344.*A}}.

The county uses a system of [[proportional representation]] in which each legislator's vote is weighted to the number of persons in their district; each district can have between one and three legislators. This system was imposed in the 1960s in the wake of the [[one man, one vote]] federal court rulings of the era; prior to this, the county operated under a true board of supervisors model. There are currently 21 members of the legislature with 15 Republicans and 6 Democrats; the county is in the process of reducing that number to 17. Each legislator serves a four-year term, with a limit of three terms.\n\nA majority of the county council are Republicans, and only two years in the entire history of the county legislature (1992 to 1994) have seen the Democrats in the majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/news/longtime-cattaraugus-county-legislator-joseph-k-eade-dies/article_ec217d20-3553-11e8-baa1-3f3613d09623.html|title=Longtime Cattaraugus County legislator Joseph K.

In the last of these, Cattaraugus County's votes proved pivotal in the 2008 elections: incumbent Republican [[Randy Kuhl]], who had strongly carried the county in 2004 and 2006, lost Cattaraugus County to Democrat [[Eric Massa]] in the 2008 elections.\n\nThe county is generally considered a \u201cred county,\u201d with Republicans usually outvoting Democrats in most statewide and national offices (for instance, in 2004 [[George W. Bush]] defeated [[John Kerry]] in Cattaraugus County by a 60\u201340 margin) although [[Bill Clinton]] won Cattaraugus County very narrowly in 1996. In 2006, the county narrowly chose [[Eliot Spitzer]] over [[John Faso]] by a margin of about 1 percent in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|the governor's race]], and [[Hillary Clinton]] defeated [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]] in the county by a 10 percentage point margin. (That being said, in all other positions up for office that year, Republicans won\u2014including all congressional and state legislature representatives.)\n\nIn 2008 the county voted for the Republican presidential candidate, with [[John McCain]] defeating [[Barack Obama]] by a 55-44% margin. In 2010, Republican [[Carl Paladino]] carried Cattaraugus County over Democrat (and eventual winner) [[Andrew Cuomo]] 65% to 31%. Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] and Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], both incumbent Democrats, carried the county by 51% to 46% and 54% to 43% margins, respectively. Despite largely being a non-factor in heavily Democratic New York's statewide elections, the county regularly has unusually high turnout for Presidential elections, with upwards of 70 percent of eligible voters typically voting in the county.\n\nAn emerging trend among Cattaraugus County's villages has been consolidation with their surrounding towns. [[Limestone, New York|Limestone]] voters approved dissolution into the [[Carrollton, New York|Town of Carrollton]] in September 2009; that took effect at the beginning of 2011. On March 18, 2010, three other villages ([[East Randolph, New York|East Randolph]], [[Randolph (CDP), New York|Randolph]] and [[Perrysburg (CDP), New York|Perrysburg]]) followed suit and approved dissolution into their surrounding towns ([[Randolph (town), New York|Town of Randolph]] for the first two, and [[Perrysburg (town), New York|Town of Perrysburg]] for the third); these three villages dissolved at the beginning of 2012.\n\n==Additional facts==\nTwo geological formations, both called \"Rock City,\" have the appearance of a town laid out with streets. One is in [[Olean (town), New York|Olean]] and the other is in [[Little Valley (town), New York|Little Valley]].\n\n[[Olean (city), New York|Olean]] is the largest city in the county and is the major center for business. [[Ski country]] runs through Cattaraugus County; two ski resorts, popular with Canadians, lie in the town of [[Ellicottville (town), New York|Ellicottville]]: [[Holiday Valley Resort]] and HoliMont; Cattaraugus County once had numerous ski resorts within its bounds, scattered throughout the county, before contracting into Ellicottville alone by 1980. In addition, several snowmobile trails cross the county, including the [[Pat McGee Trail]], a flagship for the county's trail system, and the [[North Country Trail]].\n\nCattaraugus County's current promotional nickname is the ''Enchanted Mountains.'' The county's heights are mostly described as hills; it has only two comparatively small \"mountains\" (Mount Seneca and Mount Tuscarora, both in [[Allegany State Park]]). During the 1980s, the county used the slogan ''Naturally Yours to Enjoy.''\n\nCattaraugus County is considered part of [[Appalachia]], as well as [[Western New York]], [[upstate New York]], the [[Southern Tier]], the [[Twin Tiers]] and the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Buffalo-Niagara-Cattaraugus Combined Statistical Area]]. As a result of being at a geographic crossroads, the people of Cattaraugus County speak a variety of accents, ranging from mild variants of [[Appalachian English]] to [[Inland Northern American English]], with a handful of people speaking in the more loud and nasal [[Buffalo English]].\n\nThe sales tax in Cattaraugus County is 8% (4% from New York, 4% from the county).\n\nA large [[Amish]] community is located in the western part of the county; with an estimated 2,500 residents, they constitute slightly under 3% of the county's population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/olean/health-officials-worry-about-cattaraugus-county-s-amish-amidst-u/article_ff2d5d95-b875-5c95-bcf3-b156b70c522a.html|title=Health officials worry about Cattaraugus County's Amish amidst U.S. measles outbreak|first=RICK MILLER Olean Times|last=Herald|website=Olean Times Herald|accessdate=Jan 30, 2020}}</ref> A portion of this community maintains an exceptionally older order that eschews indoor plumbing, which, combined with a small number of Seneca who still live on traditional subsistence, gives the county a high rate of homes without indoor plumbing compared to nearby counties.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/23/1-6-million-americans-dont-have-indoor-plumbing-heres-where-they-live/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost \"1.6 million Americans don't have indoor plumbing.

The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses.

Since [[John Adams]] first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. [[Harry S.

In addition, prior to ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties.

However, these nominations require [[Advice and consent#United States|Senate confirmation]] before they may take office.

The first is [[executive privilege]], which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. [[George Washington]] first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Jay]]'s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', {{ussc|418|683|1974}}, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal|Lewinsky scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'', {{ussc|520|681|1997}}, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the [[Precedent|legal precedent]] that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/06/executive_privilege.html|title=Executive Privilege 101|author=Millhiser, Ian|date=June 1, 2010|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[state secrets privilege]] allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] in legal proceedings if such release would harm [[national security]]. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when [[Thomas Jefferson]] refused to release military documents in the [[treason]] trial of [[Aaron Burr]] and again in ''[[Totten v. United States]]'' {{ussc|92|105|1876}}, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1537579.html|title=Part III of the opinion in ''Mohamed v.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

Jones]]'' (1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president, and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019 [[Mueller Report]] on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible [[obstruction of justice]], but investigators declined to refer [[Donald Trump]] for prosecution based on a [[United States Department of Justice]] policy against indicting an incumbent president.

When the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|convention]] failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, [[Alexander Hamilton]] led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in [[Philadelphia]].

The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In ''[[Clinton v.

Since [[John Adams]] first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] was the most recent to do so in July 1948 (the so-called \"[[Turnip Day Session]]\"). In addition, prior to ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties.

However, these nominations require [[Advice and consent#United States|Senate confirmation]] before they may take office.

The first is [[executive privilege]], which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. [[George Washington]] first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Jay]]'s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', {{ussc|418|683|1974}}, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal|Lewinsky scandal]], the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'', {{ussc|520|681|1997}}, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the [[Precedent|legal precedent]] that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/06/executive_privilege.html|title=Executive Privilege 101|author=Millhiser, Ian|date=June 1, 2010|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[state secrets privilege]] allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] in legal proceedings if such release would harm [[national security]]. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when [[Thomas Jefferson]] refused to release military documents in the [[treason]] trial of [[Aaron Burr]] and again in ''[[Totten v. United States]]'' {{ussc|92|105|1876}}, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1537579.html|title=Part III of the opinion in ''Mohamed v.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.
