Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |language=de |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Two days later, borders to neighbouring countries were closed. On 22 March, the government announced a national curfew, almost identical to those in to Austria and Bavaria, where it had been implemented seven days and three days before, respectively.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |language=de |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India. \n\n'''The show is currently halted due to the [[COVID-19]].'''\n\n==Summary==\nKartik likes a girl after seeing her selflessness but Kartik's mother does not like the girl because of her complexion. \n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. \n\nPurnima finds a small girl hurt on the road and the people surrounding the little kid are of no help, some shooting videos. Purnima sacrifices her school fees for the girl and donates some of her blood to her. Purnima bumps into Soni and Soni is disgusted. Soni sends a marriage proposal for Shanaya. Shanaya tells her mother that she does not like the idea of marriage. Shanaya misunderstands the groom as only the two brothers are sent there. Her choice is Kartik and not Sumreet. \n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik Mehra\n* Kavita Ghai as Soni Mehra, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Kuldeep, Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Beena, Purnima's step-mother\n* Shanaya's grandmother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora / Shanu, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Mohit Chauhan as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle Mehra / Billo, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumreet Mehra, Kartik's cousin\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kartik Purnima\n| image                    = \n| genre                    = [[Drama]] ,[[Romance]]\n| channel                  = [[Star Bharat]]\n| creator                  = Bhupinder Singh,  Sanjot Kaur\n| based_on                 = \n| writer                   = Pearl Gray, Raghuvir Shekhawat, Lakshmi Jaykumar\n| director                 = Ravid Gautam\n| creative_director        = \n| starring                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| country                  = [[India]]\n| language                 = [[Hindi language| Hindi]], [[Punjabi language| Punjabi]]\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 45 (as of 27 March 2020)\n| producer                 = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = [[Multi-camera]]\n| runtime                  = \n| company                  = \n| distributor              = [[Star India]]\n| picture_format           = \n| first_aired              = {{start date|df=yes|2020|2|03}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| website            = https://www.hotstar.com/in/tv/kartik-purnima/s-2481\n| production_website = \n}}\n\n'''''Kartik Purnima''''' is an Indian Hindi-language social drama television series, which premiered on 3rd February 2020 on [[Star Bharat]].

In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. \n\nPurnima finds a small girl hurt on the road and the people surrounding the little kid are of no help, some shooting videos. Purnima sacrifices her school fees for the girl and donates some of her blood to her. Purnima bumps into Soni and Soni is disgusted. Soni sends a marriage proposal for Shanaya. Shanaya tells her mother that she does not like the idea of marriage. Shanaya misunderstands the groom as only the two brothers are sent there. Her choice is Kartik and not Sumreet. \n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik Mehra\n* Kavita Ghai as Soni Mehra, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Beena, Purnima's step-mother\n* Shanaya's grandmother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora / Shanu, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Mohit Chauhan as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle Mehra / Billo, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumreet Mehra, Kartik's cousin\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n", "name_user": "Shameera1234", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartik_Purnima_(TV_Show)"}
