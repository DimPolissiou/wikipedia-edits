The film was adapted from Chayefsky's only novel and is his final screenplay. Both the novel and the film are based in part on [[John C. Lilly]]'s [[sensory deprivation]] research conducted in [[isolation tank]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive drugs]] like [[mescaline]], [[ketamine]], and [[LSD]].\n\nIt marked the film debut of [[William Hurt]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting \"Sidney Aaron,\" his actual first and middle names.\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[John Corigliano]] (with [[Christopher Keene]] conducting). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Jessup is a [[psychopathologist]] who, while studying [[schizophrenia]], begins to think that \"our [[Altered state of consciousness|other states of consciousness]] are as real as our waking states.\" Edward begins experimenting with [[sensory deprivation]] using a [[flotation tank]], aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow \"whiz kid\" and [[biological anthropologist]] Emily, and the two eventually marry.\n\nSeven years later, Edward and Emily have two daughters, are on the brink of divorce, and reunite with the couple who first introduced them. When Edward hears of a Mexican tribe that experiences shared illusion states, he travels to Mexico to participate in what is apparently an [[Ayahuasca]] Ceremony. During the walk into the bush, his guide says that the indigenous tribe they are meeting works with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which they are collecting for next year's ceremonies. The tribe calls one of the ingredients of the mixture they use \"First Flower.\"  An indigenous elder is seen with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' root in his hand before cutting Edward's hand, adding blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations. He returns to the U.S. with a [[tincture]] and continues taking it to trigger altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhen toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to sensory deprivation, believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early [[Hominidae]]. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have \"externalized\". Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being X-rayed before he \"reconstitutes.\" A radiologist inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a gorilla.\n\nIn later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical [[biological devolution]]. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned [[Human evolution|caveman]], going on a rampage through some streets in town before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues' concern, Edward stubbornly continues.\n\nIn the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward's colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily arrives to find a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-physical form of proto-consciousness and possibly disappearing from our version of reality altogether.\n\nHis friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to uncontrollably regress again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of \"first flower\" or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of his wife apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward's devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form. In the final scene, Edward embraces Emily, and she returns to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Hurt]] as Dr. Edward \"Eddie\" Jessup\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Emily Jessup\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Rosenberg\n* [[Charles Haid]] as Mason Parrish\n* [[Thaao Penghlis]] as Eduardo Echeverria\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Margaret Jessup\n* Megan Jeffers as Grace Jessup\n* [[Dori Brenner]] as Sylvia Rosenberg\n* Peter Brandon as Alan Hobart\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. Wissenschaft\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Hector Orteco\n* [[John Larroquette]] as X-ray technician\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film had its origins with a meeting Paddy Chayefsky had with his friends [[Bob Fosse]] and [[Herb Gardner]] at the Russian Tea Room in 1975. They were feeling \"disgruntled\" and as a joke conceived a movie they could make together. They wanted to pitch something to [[Dino De Laurentiis]], who was making ''King Kong''. After discussing a version of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' they decided to do a version of ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''.<ref name=\"Considine\">{{cite book |last1=Considine |first1=Shaun |title=Mad as hell : the life and work of Paddy Chayefsky |date=1994 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0679408924 |pages=357\u2013377 |edition=1st |accessdate=}}</ref> Chayefsky went home and wrote a three-page \"dramatic statement and I have never seen something come together so fast.\"<ref name=\"man\">The man who took a scientists approach to the novel.

During this time Chayefsky and Russell had a massive dispute and the writer left the project. He did not appear on set during filming, contrary to his normal practice.<ref name=\"mann\">Russell Films 'Altered States'. Los Angeles Times 19 July 1979: e17.</ref><ref>Russell p 192-208</ref>\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t work with someone else judging everything I did,\" said the director. \"Chayefsky told me, \u2018I\u2019ll just be on the set as a benign influence.\u2019 The producer said, \u2018How do you spell benign, Paddy?\u2019 He answered, \u2018W-I-C-K-E-D\u2019. He was joking but he wasn't joking\u2019.\"<ref name=\"danger\"/>\n\nItzkoff's book chronicles the making of ''Altered States'' and claims that Russell, objecting to Chayefsky's interference, had the writer banned from the set. Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well under way, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn).\n\nRussell said Chayefsky \"didn't like the color of the paint on the isolation tank. Then it went on to other things. He didn't like the lighting, then he didn't like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar...

But when it asks you to believe that what you're watching may really be happening, and to wonder what it means, it is asking far too much. By the time it begins straining for an ending both happy and hysterical, it has lost all of its mystery, and most of its magic.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nRichard Corliss began his review of the film thus:<ref name=\"time\"/>\n:This one has everything: sex, violence, comedy, thrills, tenderness. It's an anthology and apotheosis of American pop movies: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring\u2014into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight. Madness is its subject and substance, style and spirit. The film changes tone, even form, with its hero's every new mood and mutation. It expands and contracts with his mind until both almost crack. It keeps threatening to go bonkers, then makes good on its threat, and still remains as lucid as an aerialist on a [[high wire]]. It moves with the loping energy of a crafty psychopath, or of film makers gripped with the potential of blowing the moviegoer's mind out through his eyes and ears. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ''Altered States''.\n\nCorliss calls the film a \"dazzling piece of science fiction\"; he recognizes the film's dialogue as clearly Chayefsky's, with characters that are \"endlessly reflective and articulate, spitting out litanies of adjectives, geysers of abstract nouns, chemical chains of relative clauses\", dialogue that's a \"welcome antidote to all those recent...movies in which brutal characters speak only words of one syllable and four letters.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>  But the film is ultimately Russell's, who inherited a \"cast of unknowns\" chosen by its original director and \"gets an erotic, neurotic charge from the talking-heads scenes that recall [[Arthur Penn|Penn]] at his best.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\nPauline Kael, on the other hand, wrote that the \"grotesquely inspired\" combination of \"Russell, with his show-biz-Catholic glitz mysticism, and Chayefsky, with his show-biz-Jewish ponderousness\" results in an \"aggressively silly picture\" that \"isn't really enjoyable.\"<ref name=Kael>{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|url=https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich|url-access=registration|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinhart and Winstone|location=New York|isbn=0-03-069361-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich/page/127 127\u2013132]}}</ref>\n\n[[John C. Lilly]] liked the film, and noted the following in an ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine interview published in January 1983:\n:The scene in which the scientist becomes cosmic energy and his wife grabs him and brings him back to human form is straight out of my ''Dyadic Cyclone'' (1976)...As for the scientist's regression into an ape-like being, the late Dr. Craig Enright, who started me on K (ketamine) while taking a trip with me here by the isolation tank, suddenly \"became\" a chimp, jumping up and down and hollering for twenty-five minutes. Watching him, I was frightened. I asked him later, \"Where the hell were you?\" He said, \"I became a pre-hominid, and I was in a tree. A leopard was trying to get me. So I was trying to scare him away.\"  The manuscript of ''The Scientist'' (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, \"Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?\" I said, \"Only if he calls me and asks permission.\" He didn't call.

The film was adapted from Chayefsky's only novel and is his final screenplay. Both the novel and the film are based in part on [[John C. Lilly]]'s [[sensory deprivation]] research conducted in [[isolation tank]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive drugs]] like [[mescaline]], [[ketamine]], and [[LSD]].\n\nIt marked the film debut of [[William Hurt]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting \"Sidney Aaron,\" his actual first and middle names.\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[John Corigliano]] (with [[Christopher Keene]] conducting). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Jessup is a [[psychopathologist]] who, while studying [[schizophrenia]], begins to think that \"our [[Altered state of consciousness|other states of consciousness]] are as real as our waking states.\" Edward begins experimenting with [[sensory deprivation]] using a [[flotation tank]], aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow \"whiz kid\" and [[biological anthropologist]] Emily, and the two eventually marry.\n\nSeven years later, Edward and Emily have two daughters, are on the brink of divorce, and reunite with the couple who first introduced them. When Edward hears of a Mexican tribe that experiences shared illusion states, he travels to Mexico to participate in what is apparently an [[Ayahuasca]] Ceremony. During the walk into the bush, his guide says that the indigenous tribe they are meeting works with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which they are collecting for next year's ceremonies. The tribe calls one of the ingredients of the mixture they use \"First Flower.\"  An indigenous elder is seen with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' root in his hand before cutting Edward's hand, adding blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations. He returns to the U.S. with a [[tincture]] and continues taking it to trigger altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhen toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to sensory deprivation, believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early [[Hominidae]]. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have \"externalized\". Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being X-rayed before he \"reconstitutes.\" A radiologist inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a gorilla.\n\nIn later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical [[biological devolution]]. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned [[Human evolution|caveman]], going on a rampage through some streets in town before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues' concern, Edward stubbornly continues.\n\nIn the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward's colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily arrives to find a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-physical form of proto-consciousness and possibly disappearing from our version of reality altogether.\n\nHis friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to uncontrollably regress again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of \"first flower\" or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of his wife apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward's devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form. In the final scene, Edward embraces Emily, and she returns to normal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Hurt]] as Dr. Edward \"Eddie\" Jessup\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Emily Jessup\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Rosenberg\n* [[Charles Haid]] as Mason Parrish\n* [[Thaao Penghlis]] as Eduardo Echeverria\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Margaret Jessup\n* Megan Jeffers as Grace Jessup\n* [[Dori Brenner]] as Sylvia Rosenberg\n* Peter Brandon as Alan Hobart\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. Wissenschaft\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Hector Orteco\n* [[John Larroquette]] as X-ray technician\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film had its origins with a meeting Paddy Chayefsky had with his friends [[Bob Fosse]] and [[Herb Gardner]] at the Russian Tea Room in 1975.

Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well under way, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn).\n\nRussell said Chayefsky \"didn't like the color of the paint on the isolation tank. Then it went on to other things. He didn't like the lighting, then he didn't like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar... There was a lot of embarrassing dialogue, and there was a hell of a lot more in the original script than there is now; it was a verbose script.\"<ref name=\"jay\">'Mad doctor' Russell creates a monster hit.

The direction, without being mocking or campy, treats outlandish material so matter-of-factly that it often has a facetious ring. The screenplay, on the other hand, cries out to be taken seriously, as it addresses, with no particular sagacity, the death of God and the [[origin of man|origins of man]].\n\nFilm critic [[Richard Corliss]] attributed Chayefsky's disavowal of the film to distress over \"the intensity of the performances and the headlong pace at which the actors read his dialogue.\"<ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922287-1,00.html Invasion of the Mind Snatcher], a December 1980 review by [[Richard Corliss]] in [[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\n\"Paddy's hallucinations were impossible to film,\" said Russell later. \"He'd write a direction, something like Interstellar gas shot through 5 million miles of universe like a puff of cigarette smoke.'

He later said \"I thought I would hate Hollywood, but I rather liked it.

If it is not wholly visionary at every juncture, it is at least dependably\u2014even exhilaratingly\u2014bizarre. Its strangeness, which borders cheerfully on the ridiculous, is its most enjoyable feature.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/> She also called it \"in fine shape as long as it revels in its own craziness, making no claims on the viewer's reason. But when it asks you to believe that what you're watching may really be happening, and to wonder what it means, it is asking far too much. By the time it begins straining for an ending both happy and hysterical, it has lost all of its mystery, and most of its magic.\"<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nRichard Corliss began his review of the film thus:<ref name=\"time\"/>\n:This one has everything: sex, violence, comedy, thrills, tenderness. It's an anthology and apotheosis of American pop movies: ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring\u2014into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight. Madness is its subject and substance, style and spirit. The film changes tone, even form, with its hero's every new mood and mutation. It expands and contracts with his mind until both almost crack. It keeps threatening to go bonkers, then makes good on its threat, and still remains as lucid as an aerialist on a [[high wire]]. It moves with the loping energy of a crafty psychopath, or of film makers gripped with the potential of blowing the moviegoer's mind out through his eyes and ears. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ''Altered States''.\n\nCorliss calls the film a \"dazzling piece of science fiction\"; he recognizes the film's dialogue as clearly Chayefsky's, with characters that are \"endlessly reflective and articulate, spitting out litanies of adjectives, geysers of abstract nouns, chemical chains of relative clauses\", dialogue that's a \"welcome antidote to all those recent...movies in which brutal characters speak only words of one syllable and four letters.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>  But the film is ultimately Russell's, who inherited a \"cast of unknowns\" chosen by its original director and \"gets an erotic, neurotic charge from the talking-heads scenes that recall [[Arthur Penn|Penn]] at his best.\"<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\nPauline Kael, on the other hand, wrote that the \"grotesquely inspired\" combination of \"Russell, with his show-biz-Catholic glitz mysticism, and Chayefsky, with his show-biz-Jewish ponderousness\" results in an \"aggressively silly picture\" that \"isn't really enjoyable.\"<ref name=Kael>{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|url=https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich|url-access=registration|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinhart and Winstone|location=New York|isbn=0-03-069361-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/takingitallin00kaelrich/page/127 127\u2013132]}}</ref>\n\n[[John C. Lilly]] liked the film, and noted the following in an ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine interview published in January 1983:\n:The scene in which the scientist becomes cosmic energy and his wife grabs him and brings him back to human form is straight out of my ''Dyadic Cyclone'' (1976)...As for the scientist's regression into an ape-like being, the late Dr. Craig Enright, who started me on K (ketamine) while taking a trip with me here by the isolation tank, suddenly \"became\" a chimp, jumping up and down and hollering for twenty-five minutes. Watching him, I was frightened. I asked him later, \"Where the hell were you?\" He said, \"I became a pre-hominid, and I was in a tree. A leopard was trying to get me. So I was trying to scare him away.\"  The manuscript of ''The Scientist'' (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, \"Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?\" I said, \"Only if he calls me and asks permission.\" He didn't call. But he probably read the manuscript.<ref>http://www.housevampyr.com/training/library/books/omni/OMNI_1983_01.pdf</ref>\n\nChristopher John reviewed ''Altered States'' in ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]]'' #6 and commented that \"Simply put, ''Altered States'' is very good at what it proposes to do \u2013 luckily it proposed to do very little.\"<ref name=\"Ares\">{{cite journal | last=John | first=Christopher | title=Film & Television | journal=[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]] | publisher=[[Simulations Publications, Inc.]] | date=January 1981 | issue=6 | page=10-11}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Ready for My Close-Up!: Great Movie Speeches'' (2007), screenwriter [[Denny Martin Flinn]] called Chayefsky's screenplay \"brilliant\" and selected Emily's speech as \"Chayefsky's last great take on life and love.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5I0Kc6St5sC&pg=PA154|title=Ready for My Close-up!: Great Movie Speeches|page=154|last=Flinn|first=Denny Martin|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=2007|isbn=978-0879103507}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[TV Guide]]'', [[Basil Dearden]]'s 1963 film ''[[The Mind Benders (1963 film)|The Mind Benders]]'' \"is the direct predecessor of ''Altered States''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/the-mind-benders/review/106300 |title=The Mind Benders Review |publisher=Movies.tvguide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref>  [[The Mind Benders]] was a serious, quasi horrific look at mind bending through the use of sensory isolation and did indeed pave the way for ''Altered States.''

The film stars [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Eric Bana]], [[Theo James]], [[Aidan Turner]], and [[Jack Reynor]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was released in the Republic of Ireland and the UK by Vertigo Releasing on 19 May 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film alternates between the early years of World War II and the end of the 20th century.\n\nRose McNulty ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]) has been a patient in the [[St. Columba's Hospital|Sligo Regional Mental Hospital]] for 40 years since being accused of murdering her baby in 1942. The facility is scheduled for demolition. Dr. Stephen Grene ([[Eric Bana]]) is a psychiatrist who, at the request of the local Catholic Church, is evaluating whether Rose should be transferred or released. He grew up in the area and has returned to sell his parents' home. Rose is adamant that she did not kill her baby and tells her story to Stephen using the pages of a Bible on which she has written and drawn an account of her life before her incarceration.\n\nAround 1940, Rose ([[Rooney Mara]]), an orphaned young woman, evacuates from Northern Ireland to live with her aunt in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which is a neutral country. There, without any intent, she attracts the interest of many of the local men. She has a brief flirtation with Michael McNulty ([[Jack Reynor]]), a Protestant who sympathizes with the British war effort and soon leaves to join the RAF. She tries to avoid the inappropriate attention of the local Catholic priest, Father Gaunt ([[Theo James]]). She dances with Jack Conroy ([[Aidan Turner]]), one of a group of anti-British Catholics.  Seeking to avoid trouble after a fight between Father Gaunt and Jack, her aunt sends Rose to live in a deserted farmhouse outside the village. \n\nOne day a plane crashes nearby and Rose discovers the pilot hanging from a tree, trapped in his parachute. She cuts him down, discovers it is Michael and shelters him while he recovers, hiding him from the anti-British locals. They grow close and just as he is about to leave they confess their love, have sex, and are quickly married by the local Protestant pastor. Before Michael can leave, the anti-British locals seize him from Rose's cottage and later kill him.\n\nFather Gaunt, knowing that Rose had slept with Michael, writes a damning report of Rose's mental health, stating she suffers from \"nymphomania\". With the permission of her aunt, her only living relative, she is incarcerated in a local mental hospital and where subjected to both insulin shock treatment (insulin coma therapy) and later, electric shock therapy (ECT or electroconvulsive therapy). She discovers that she is pregnant and learns that babies born to single women are given up for adoption or spend their entire lives within the institution. She escapes to the beach. Pursued by Father Gaunt, she swims to a cove where she gives birth. The policeman in pursuit in a boat with Gaunt can see Rose striking the ground with a rock and believes that she is killing her newborn son. In truth, Father Gaunt has taken the baby. \n\nIn the present Stephen reveals to Rose's nurse ([[Susan Lynch]]) that his own father tried to tell him something about his parentage on his deathbed. He reads a passage from Rose's writing that suggests the baby was born in spring and an official document states 1 May 1942, the same day he was born. Searching his parents' papers, he finds a letter to him from his father revealing that he was indeed adopted and enclosed is a cross from his real father. He then figures out who his real parents are. Stephen returns to the mental asylum and shows Rose the letter. Stephen takes Rose to his family home.\n\nIf life is a secret scripture, the real reader is that who suffers the similar pain. \n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Old Roseanne McNulty\n*

The film stars [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Eric Bana]], [[Theo James]], [[Aidan Turner]], and [[Jack Reynor]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was released in the Republic of Ireland and the UK by Vertigo Releasing on 19 May 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film alternates between the early years of World War II and the end of the 20th century.\n\nRose McNulty ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]) has been a patient in the [[St. Columba's Hospital|Sligo Regional Mental Hospital]] for 40 years since being accused of murdering her baby in 1942. The facility is scheduled for demolition. Dr. Stephen Grene ([[Eric Bana]]) is a psychiatrist who, at the request of the local Catholic Church, is evaluating whether Rose should be transferred or released. He grew up in the area and has returned to sell his parents' home. Rose is adamant that she did not kill her baby and tells her story to Stephen using the pages of a Bible on which she has written and drawn an account of her life before her incarceration.\n\nAround 1940, Rose ([[Rooney Mara]]), an orphaned young woman, evacuates from Northern Ireland to live with her aunt in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which is a neutral country. There, without any intent, she attracts the interest of many of the local men. She has a brief flirtation with Michael McNulty ([[Jack Reynor]]), a Protestant who sympathizes with the British war effort and soon leaves to join the RAF. She tries to avoid the inappropriate attention of the local Catholic priest, Father Gaunt ([[Theo James]]). She dances with Jack Conroy ([[Aidan Turner]]), one of a group of anti-British Catholics.  Seeking to avoid trouble after a fight between Father Gaunt and Jack, her aunt sends Rose to live in a deserted farmhouse outside the village. \n\nOne day a plane crashes nearby and Rose discovers the pilot hanging from a tree, trapped in his parachute. She cuts him down, discovers it is Michael and shelters him while he recovers, hiding him from the anti-British locals. They grow close and just as he is about to leave they confess their love, have sex, and are quickly married by the local Protestant pastor. Before Michael can leave, the anti-British locals seize him from Rose's cottage and later kill him.\n\nFather Gaunt, knowing that Rose had slept with Michael, writes a damning report of Rose's mental health, stating she suffers from \"nymphomania\". With the permission of her aunt, her only living relative, she is incarcerated in a local mental hospital and where subjected to both insulin shock treatment (insulin coma therapy) and later, electric shock therapy (ECT or electroconvulsive therapy). She discovers that she is pregnant and learns that babies born to single women are given up for adoption or spend their entire lives within the institution. She escapes to the beach. Pursued by Father Gaunt, she swims to a cove where she gives birth. The policeman in pursuit in a boat with Gaunt can see Rose striking the ground with a rock and believes that she is killing her newborn son. In truth, Father Gaunt has taken the baby. \n\nIn the present Stephen reveals to Rose's nurse ([[Susan Lynch]]) that his own father tried to tell him something about his parentage on his deathbed. He reads a passage from Rose's writing that suggests the baby was born in spring and an official document states 1 May 1942, the same day he was born. Searching his parents' papers, he finds a letter to him from his father revealing that he was indeed adopted and enclosed is a cross from his real father. He then figures out who his real parents are. Stephen returns to the mental asylum and shows Rose the letter. Stephen takes Rose to his family home.\n\nIf life is a secret scripture, the real reader is that who suffers the same pain. \n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Old Roseanne McNulty\n* [[Rooney

Thousands of people gather at McFarland Park starting in the morning for a day spent listening to a variety of musical acts. The celebration concludes around 10:00&nbsp;p.m. with a fireworks display over the Tennessee River.\n*The [[W. C. Handy Music Festival]]. Every year for a week in late July or early August, musicians from around the country descend upon the Shoals. Area restaurants offer live music, and artists often perform in Wilson Park or along streets downtown. Though the focus was originally on blues and jazz, the musical selection now includes rock, country, gospel and others. The festival, the largest in the Shoals area, also includes educational events, art shows,mans athletic competitions.\n*Every September, Florence is the termination point for riders in the annual [http://www.trailoftears-remembrance.org/ Trail of Tears Remembrance Motorcycle Ride], which terminates in nearby McFarland Park.

Both [[U.S. Route 43|U.S. Highway 43]] and [[U.S. Route 72|U.S. Highway 72]] merge just east of the city limits in [[Killen, Alabama|Killen]], and are co-signed their entire length through the city. Highway 43, running north and south, helps connect the city to [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]] to the north in [[Tennessee]], as well as [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to the south. Highway 72 helps connect the city to [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] to the east and [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to the west. [[Interstate 65]] is accessible about forty-five minutes east on Highway 72. Both of these roads cross the Tennessee River on O'Neal Bridge, connecting Florence to Sheffield.\n\nAlabama state highways that serve the city include [[Alabama State Route 13|State Route 13]], [[Alabama State Route 17|State Route 17]], [[Alabama State Route 20|State Route 20]], [[Alabama State Route 133|State Route 133]], and [[Alabama State Route 157|State Route 157]]. Alabama 133 connected Florence and Muscle Shoals via Wilson Dam until 2002, when the new six-lane \"Patton Island Bridge\" finished construction. The bridge is part of a new corridor that will eventually see the widening of Wilson Dam Road in Muscle Shoals to Alabama 20, and the construction of a new road from the bridge to Florence Blvd. in Florence. State Route 157, a road to Florence and the Shoals area, serves  as a four-lane link to [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] in [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]]. the project was completed in the summer of 2007. The road is known as the \"University of North Alabama Highway\".\n\nFlorence and the Shoals area does not have a direct link to an Interstate highway. One solution discussed has been the Memphis to Atlanta Highway, proposed to connect the two cities via a freeway through north Alabama. However, in recent years Mississippi has concentrated its funding on U.S. 78 ([[Interstate 22]]), also known as \"Corridor X\". Though U.S. 72 through Mississippi is four lanes, there are no plans to upgrade it to freeway status. The state of Georgia has also not committed to the necessary work to connect the freeway from the Alabama state line to Atlanta. The highway remains in the planning stages with the Alabama Department of Transportation.\n\nAnother plan recently discussed is extending [[Interstate 565]] west from its current terminus just outside [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], along Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72. The plan has received support from Decatur officials.\n\nFlorence is served by the [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] in Muscle Shoals. The airport is used for commercial and general aviation, It is served commercially by [[Boutique Air]] which provides several daily flights to Atlanta and Nashville. [[Huntsville International Airport]], another option for Florence residents, offers service to eleven domestic destinations, and is an hour's drive from Florence.\n\nLocal industry is served by the [[Tennessee Southern Railroad]] (TSRR), which runs from Florence to Columbia, Tennessee, and the Port of Florence on Pickwick Lake.\n\n==Media==\n\n[[TimesDaily]]\n\n[http://quadcitiesdaily.com/ Quad-Cities Daily]\n\n[http://pennswordtwo.com/ Pen-N-Sword]\n\n''Courier-Journal''\n\n[[WAFF (TV)|WAFF-TV]] ([[NBC]]), [[WHNT-TV]] ([[CBS]]), [[WAAY-TV]] ([[ABC Studios|ABC]]), [[WZDX|WZDX-TV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]), and [[WHDF|WHDF-TV]] ([[The CW]]).\n\nNumerous radio, television and low-power FM radio stations and translators serve Florence and the greater area, all of which are in the greater Florence MSA.

Situated along Pickwick Lake, the park is also used by fishermen, boaters, and swimmers.\n*[http://www.flightoftheeducator.com/road-trip-florence-alabama/ River Heritage Park] is located at the base of the Renaissance Tower and adjacent to the Marriott Shoals Hotel and Conference Center. The park contains scenic overlooks of the Tennessee River and Wilson Dam. Also included are picnic shelters, a playground, and an interactive fountain called the Splash Pad.\n*Veterans Memorial Park contains a memorial to the war veterans of Florence and Lauderdale county.

It is the most secluded and serene of the city parks. The park has a pavilion, picnic tables, nature trails, and bicycle trails. Swimming, fishing and canoeing are some of the park's recreational activities.\n*Wilson Park is located in the heart of downtown, across from the Florence-Lauderdale Public Library. Its grounds are used for numerous festivals and events. The original Plan of Florence in 1818 showed the area as a Public Walk. In 1924, the park was renamed in honor of former U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], shortly after his death.<ref name=\"hmdb\">{{cite web |title=Woodrow Wilson Park 1818 |publisher=The Historical Marker Database |url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=35665 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n===Other recreation===\n*Blackberry Trail Golf Course - a municipal golf course\n*Broadway Recreation Center\n*Florence Harbor - a full-service marina on Tennessee River (Pickwick Lake) mile marker 256<ref>{{cite web |title=Florence Harbor Marina |url=http://florenceharbor.com |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref>\n*Handy Recreation Center \n*Royal Avenue Recreation Center \n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Florence, Alabama O'Neal Bridge by Noah McDonald.jpg|alt=|thumb|O'Neal Bridge over the Tennessee River]]\nFlorence is the merger point for two major [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]], as well as several [[List of state highways in Alabama|Alabama Highways]]. Both [[U.S. Route 43|U.S. Highway 43]] and [[U.S. Route 72|U.S. Highway 72]] merge just east of the city limits in [[Killen, Alabama|Killen]], and are co-signed their entire length through the city. Highway 43, running north and south, helps connect the city to [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]] to the north in [[Tennessee]], as well as [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to the south. Highway 72 helps connect the city to [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] to the east and [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to the west. [[Interstate 65]] is accessible about forty-five minutes east on Highway 72. Both of these roads cross the Tennessee River on O'Neal Bridge, connecting Florence to Sheffield.\n\nAlabama state highways that serve the city include [[Alabama State Route 13|State Route 13]], [[Alabama State Route 17|State Route 17]], [[Alabama State Route 20|State Route 20]], [[Alabama State Route 133|State Route 133]], and [[Alabama State Route 157|State Route 157]]. Alabama 133 connected Florence and Muscle Shoals via Wilson Dam until 2002, when the new six-lane \"Patton Island Bridge\" finished construction. The bridge is part of a new corridor that will eventually see the widening of Wilson Dam Road in Muscle Shoals to Alabama 20, and the construction of a new road from the bridge to Florence Blvd. in Florence. State Route 157, a road to Florence and the Shoals area, serves  as a four-lane link to [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] in [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]]. the project was completed in the summer of 2007. The road is known as the \"University of North Alabama Highway\".\n\nFlorence and the Shoals area does not have a direct link to an Interstate highway. One solution discussed has been the Memphis to Atlanta Highway, proposed to connect the two cities via a freeway through north Alabama. However, in recent years Mississippi has concentrated its funding on U.S. 78 ([[Interstate 22]]), also known as \"Corridor X\". Though U.S. 72 through Mississippi is four lanes, there are no plans to upgrade it to freeway status. The state of Georgia has also not committed to the necessary work to connect the freeway from the Alabama state line to Atlanta. The highway remains in the planning stages with the Alabama Department of Transportation.\n\nAnother plan recently discussed is extending [[Interstate 565]] west from its current terminus just outside [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], along Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72. The plan has received support from Decatur officials.\n\nFlorence is served by the [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] in Muscle Shoals. The airport is used for commercial and general aviation, It is served commercially by [[Boutique Air]] which provides several daily flights to Atlanta and Nashville. [[Huntsville International Airport]], another option for Florence residents, offers service to eleven domestic destinations, and is an hour's drive from Florence.\n\nLocal industry is served by the [[Tennessee Southern Railroad]] (TSRR), which runs from Florence to Columbia, Tennessee, and the Port of Florence on Pickwick Lake.\n\n==Media==\n\n[[TimesDaily]]\n\n[http://quadcitiesdaily.com/ Quad-Cities Daily]\n\n[http://pennswordtwo.com/ Pen-N-Sword]\n\n''Courier-Journal''\n\n[[WAFF (TV)|WAFF-TV]] ([[NBC]]), [[WHNT-TV]] ([[CBS]]), [[WAAY-TV]] ([[ABC Studios|ABC]]), [[WZDX|WZDX-TV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]), and [[WHDF|WHDF-TV]] ([[The CW]]).\n\nNumerous radio, television and low-power FM radio stations and translators serve Florence and the greater area, all of which are in the greater Florence MSA.

Their services include television, internet, home phone, and home security services. Comcast has been a provider of television and other services in the Florence area since the early 1960s. AT&T has provided services to Florence since the early 2000s, when they acquired [[BellSouth|Bell South]]. Florence is also served by major satellite television providers, including [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]].\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] system, Florence has a [[humid subtropical climate]], abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps.<ref name=\"weatherbase.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=723233&cityname=Florence,+Alabama,+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Florence, Alabama K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe average temperature of Florence is 59 F (15 C).

For example, in 2005, the path of [[Hurricane Katrina]] came very close to the city, causing nearly 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) winds and some storm damage.\n\n==Notable people==\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n*[[Walt Aldridge]], songwriter and record producer\n*[[Malcolm Armstead]], professional basketball player\n*[[Ron Billingsley]], former professional football player\n*[[Whitney Boddie]], professional basketball player in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA)\n*[[Sterling Bose]], jazz trumpeter\n*[[Jeff Brantley]], former [[Major League Baseball]] pitcher\n*[[Jeff Briggs]], video game developer and CEO of [[Firaxis Games]]\n*[[Roger Briggs]], composer\n*[[Greg Burdine]], member of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\n*[[Thomas Burrows]], professional baseball player\n*[[The Butler Twins]], [[Detroit blues]] musicians\n*[[Jerry Carrigan]], drummer and record producer\n*[[Stewart Cink]], PGA golfer, [[2009 British Open]] Champion\n*[[John Coffee]], General during the [[War of 1812]]\n*[[Dennis Condrey]], [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and member of [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]]\n*[[Oscar De Priest]], the first [[African American]] to be elected to Congress from outside the southern states and the first in the 20th century\n*[[Bud Dunn]], horse trainer who won the [[Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration#World Grand Championship|Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship]] twice\n*[[Ronnie Flippo]], U.S. Representative from 1977 to 1991\n*[[Byron Franklin]], former [[National Football League]] (NFL) wide receiver\n*[[Donnie Fritts]], musician and [[songwriter]]\n*[[Eric \"Red Mouth\" Gebhardt]], [[singer-songwriter]]\n*[[Donna Jean Godchaux]], singer, [[The Grateful Dead]]\n*[[Brett Guthrie]], U.S. Representative from [[Kentucky]]\n*[[Elbert Bertram Haltom, Jr.]], former [[United States federal judge]]\n*[[William Christopher Handy|W.

{"title_page": "Provost (education)", "text_new": "{{short description|Senior academic administrator}}\n{{no footnotes|date=December 2011}}\n\nA '''provost''' is the senior [[academic administration|academic administrator]] at many institutions of [[higher education]] in the United States and Canada and the equivalent of a deputy vice-chancellor at some institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. Additionally, the heads of certain [[colleges]] in the UK and Ireland are called provosts; it is, in this sense, the equivalent of a [[Master (college)|master]] at other colleges.\n\n==Duties, role, and selection==\nThe specific duties and areas of responsibility for a provost vary from one institution to another, but usually include supervision and oversight of [[Curriculum|curricular]], instructional, and [[research]] affairs.\n\nThe various [[Dean (education)|deans]] of a [[university]]'s schools, colleges, or [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] generally report to the provost, or jointly to them and the institution's [[chief executive officer]], whether that is called its [[University president|president]], [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]], or [[Rector (academia)|rector]].  Likewise the heads of various [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] units and academic support functions, such as [[Academic library|libraries]], student services, the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]], [[University and college admissions|admissions]], and [[information technology]]. The provost, in turn, is responsible to the institution's chief executive officer and governing board or boards (variously called its [[board of trustees|trustees]], the [[board of regents|regents]], the [[board of governors|governors]], or the [[corporation]]) for oversight of all educational affairs and activities, including research and academic personnel. \n\nIn many but not all North American institutions, the provost or equivalent is the second-ranking officer in the administrative hierarchy. Often the provost may serve as acting chief executive officer during a vacancy in that office or when the incumbent is absent from campus for prolonged periods. In these institutions, the title of provost is sometimes combined with those of ''senior vice president'', ''executive vice president'', ''executive [[vice chancellor]]'', or the like, to denote that officer's high standing. {{Cn|date=May 2018}}\n\nProvosts often receive staff support or delegate line responsibility for certain administrative functions to one or more subordinates variously called ''assistant provost'', ''associate provost'', ''vice provost'', or ''deputy provost''. The deputy provost is often the right-hand person of the provost who assumes the provost's responsibilities in the provost's absence.\n\nProvosts are often chosen by a search committee made up of [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members, and are almost always drawn from the '[[tenure]]d faculty' or 'professional administrators' with academic credentials, either at the institution or from other institutions.\n\n==Titles and other uses==\nAt some North American [[research universities]] and [[liberal arts college]]s, other titles may be used in place of or in combination with provost, such as '''chief academic officer''' ('''CAO''') or '''[[vice president]] for academic affairs''' (or, rarely, '''academic vice-president''', '''academic vice rector''',  or '''vice president for education'''). At smaller independent liberal arts colleges, the chief academic officer may carry the title \"dean of the college\" or \"dean of the faculty\" in addition to or instead of ''provost''. For example, at [[Trinity College, Hartford|Trinity College]] in Hartford, Connecticut, the dean of the faculty is also the vice president for academic affairs and is the second-highest administrator, directly beneath the president.\n\n[[State university system]]s in the United States are the [[state university|state universities]] operated and funded primarily by the [[state governments of the United States|state government]]. (They may include multiple administratively independent campuses, or an integrated multi-[[campus]] state university.) In some state university systems, ''provost'' may be the title held by the head of a branch campus. For example, until recently the chancellors of the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark|Newark]] and [[Rutgers\u2013Camden|Camden]] campuses of [[Rutgers University]] in New Jersey were known as provosts.\n\nSometimes the chief academic officer or [[chief medical officer]] of a university medical center (also academic medical center) holds the title of provost.\n\nIn some universities, the chief administrative officer of a large academic division may be a provost. Finally, in some colleges and universities, the title of provost (and the function of deputy to the president or chancellor) may be separate from the function of chief academic officer.\n\n''Provost'' is the style of the heads of [[University College London]]; the [[Royal College of Art]]; [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel]], [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's]] and [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester]] Colleges at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] at [[University of Dublin|Dublin]]; and [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)]], as well as the deputy head of [[Imperial College London]]. The [[Provost of Eton|chairman of the governors]] of [[Eton College]] is also called a provost. There are also Provosts for the [[University of Reading]] Malaysia Campus.\n\n==History==\nThe title \"provost\" (Latin: ''praepositus'') was used in England in medieval times for the head of colleges such as [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and [[Eton College]]. In the context of local government, the title is even older; see [[provost (civil)|civil provost]]\n\nThe first use of the title in American and Canadian higher education is unclear. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Columbia University]], the title dates from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, respectively. At Penn, the administrative head of the university was titled provost until the 1930s, when the board of trustees created a separate office of president and re-designated the provost as chief academic officer and subordinate to the new position. At Columbia, the board of trustees established the office of provost in 1811, only to abolish it five years later. The Trustees and the president of the university re-established the office of provost in 1912. Although the precise title of the office has changed over time, its responsibility as Columbia's chief academic officer has remained constant.\n\nOther North American universities and colleges created provosts as heads of academic affairs during and after [[World War II]], when dramatic increases in undergraduate enrollments (due to the [[G.I. Bill]]) and the increased complexity of higher education administration led many chief executive officers to adopt a more corporate governing structure. By the 1960s, most of the other [[Ivy League]] institutions ([[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], and [[Brown University|Brown]]) had provosts (or equivalents), as did other private research universities such as the [[University of Chicago]], [[Stanford University]], [[Rice University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Tufts University]], [[Emory University]], [[Wake Forest University]] and [[Duke University]].\n\nAt [[Harvard University]], the office of provost has had two distinct incarnations. The first was during World War II and the immediate postwar era. [[James Bryant Conant]], the president of the university from 1933 to 1953, asked the Harvard Corporation (the more senior of the two governing boards) to create the office of provost in October 1945, at time when he (Conant) spent a great deal of time in Washington, D.C. as chairman of the [[National Defense Research Committee]]. A provision was created where the dean of the Faculty of Arts of Sciences (FAS) would concurrently serve as provost. Conant appointed historian [[Paul Herman Buck]], in which capacity he had oversight of FAS (which includes Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Extension School, the Summer School, and what is now called the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) and its affiliated laboratories, research centers, and museums. However, he had no authority over Harvard's professional schools (at that time, the Divinity School, the Law School, the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Public Health, and the Graduate Schools of Business Administration, Design, Education, and Public Administration). \n\nThat provost's office was eliminated when Conant retired from Harvard's presidency in 1953. During the presidencies of [[Nathan Marsh Pusey]] (1953\u20131971) and Derek C. Bok (1971\u20131993), the deans of Harvard's nine faculties reported directly to the president, with the dean of FAS being ''[[primus inter pares]]''. The second incarnation began in 1993, when then Harvard President Neil Rudenstine asked the corporation to create the provostship as a second university-wide academic officer, reporting to its president. \n\nA section of Harvard's 1997 Re-accreditation Report for the [[New England Commission of Colleges and Schools]] reads:\n\n<blockquote>The Provost at Harvard acts as an extension of the President. He is the second academic officer, after the President, having purview of the entire University. The Provost has special responsibility for fostering intellectual interactions across the University, including the five Interfaculty Initiatives (environment, ethics and the professions, schooling and children, mind/brain/behavior, and health policy). The Provost also acts to help improve the quality and efficiency of central services organized at Harvard under the aegis of the Vice Presidents.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Director (education)]]\n* [[Postgraduate education]]\n* [[Principal (university)]]\n* [[Professor]]\n* [[Undergraduate education]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://provost.cornell.edu/about/history-of-cornells-provosts/ \"History of Cornell's Provosts\"], [http://provost.cornell.edu/about/ \"About the Provost\"], [[Cornell University]] Office of the Provost. \n* Freeland, Richard M.
