It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]\nIn July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].\n\nGovernor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.\n\nThe regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.\n\nThe regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. \n\nMajor [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. \n\n[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]\nIt was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].\n\nOn September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].\n\nOn September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].\n\nDuring the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" \n\nThe history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].\n\nThe original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.\n\n==Medal of Honor==\n\nSix members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\n* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co. F, \" removed, under a hot fire, a wounded member of his command to a place of safety,\" at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], June 5, 1864.\n* Gardner C. Hawkins, 1st Lieutenant, Co.

Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.\n\nUpon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 4'' is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]'', was released on October 7, 2016.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n<!-- Please do not add speculative content to this section or the plot section from YouTube videos, the FNAF Wiki, or your imagination as they are not considered reliable sources. -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bedroomviewfnaf4.jpg|thumb|left|Instead of the player being in an office they are in a child's bedroom]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plushtrap.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame.]] -->\nUnlike previous ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom; there are also no [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] and instead of \"Phone Guy\", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game.<ref name=\"KotakuAll\">{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-five-nights-at-freddys-4-so-f-1720003919 | title=Everything We Know About Five Nights at Freddy's 4 (So Far) | publisher=Kotaku | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Hernandez, Patricia}}</ref> The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second game]], although the light has unlimited power.<ref name= \"Destruct\">{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-five-nights-at-freddy-s-4-296612.phtml | title=Review: Five Nights at Freddy's 4 | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Rowen, Nic}}</ref> It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hallway; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door. Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's|first game]], as well as shooing three miniature animatronics nicknamed 'Freddles' by the FNAF community off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be [[jumpscare]]d, leading to a [[game over]].\n\nAfter beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled \"Fun with Plushtrap\" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', must be lured to the top of an \"X\" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player wins, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.\n\nLike previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the \"Nightmare\" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] of the animatronics to maximum difficulty.

Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.\n\nUpon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 4'' is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]'', was released on October 7, 2016.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n<!-- Please do not add speculative content to this section or the plot section from YouTube videos, the FNAF Wiki, or your imagination as they are not considered reliable sources. -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bedroomviewfnaf4.jpg|thumb|left|Instead of the player being in an office they are in a child's bedroom]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plushtrap.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame.]] -->\nUnlike previous ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom; there are also no [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] and instead of \"Phone Guy\", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game.<ref name=\"KotakuAll\">{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-five-nights-at-freddys-4-so-f-1720003919 | title=Everything We Know About Five Nights at Freddy's 4 (So Far) | publisher=Kotaku | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Hernandez, Patricia}}</ref> The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second game]], although the light has unlimited power.<ref name= \"Destruct\">{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-five-nights-at-freddy-s-4-296612.phtml | title=Review: Five Nights at Freddy's 4 | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Rowen, Nic}}</ref> It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hallway; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door. Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's|first game]], as well as shooing three miniature animatronics nicknamed 'Freddles' by the FNAF community off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be [[jumpscare]]d, leading to a [[game over]].\n\nAfter beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled \"Fun with Plushtrap\" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', must be lured to the top of an \"X\" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player wins, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.\n\nLike previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the \"Nightmare\" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy.<ref name=\"Extras\">{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon| publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene =Extras menu| quote = }}</ref>\n\nAs in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive [[Retrogaming|Atari-style]] minigame sections between nights.

He gave only one clue: \"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\"\n\n\nThroughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.\n\n== Development and release ==\nBeginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''. The images, featuring the characters from the series, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/28/five-nights-at-freddys-4-release-date/ | title = Five Night\u2019s at Freddy\u2019s 4 teased for Halloween release | first =Brenna | last = Hillier | date = April 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2015 | work = [[VG247]]|publisher = Videogaming 247 Ltd. }}</ref> A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house.

One consists of a set of cheat options, challenge modes, and an altered version of the \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame that uses a nightmare version of the character Balloon Boy (from ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'') in place of Plushtrap. The second is a \"Halloween Edition\" that makes cosmetic changes to Nightmare Bonnie and Nightmare Chica, and introduces nightmare versions of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'''s characters Mangle and The Puppet, (known as Nightmarionne in-game) the former replacing Nightmare Foxy and the latter replacing Nightmare. Nightmare Chica's cupcake is also replaced with a [[Jack-o-Lantern]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{VG reception\n| MC = (PC) 51/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys-4 |title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4 for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Corporation]] |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 4/10<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n| PCGUS = 70/100<ref name=\"PCG\">{{cite web|url= http://www.pcgamer.com/five-nights-at-freddys-4-review/|title= Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Review on PC Gamer|publisher= [[PC Gamer]]|date= August 5, 2015|accessdate= August 13, 2015}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"The Escapist\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Gamezebo]]''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"GZ\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[TouchArcade]]''\n| rev3Score = (iOS) {{rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://toucharcade.com/2015/08/10/five-nights-at-freddys-4-review/ |title='Five Nights At Freddy's 4' Review \u2013 The Latest Freddy Gets The Worst Port Yet |last=Musgrave |first=Shaun |date=August 10, 2015 |website=[[TouchArcade]] |accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\nThe PC version of the game received an aggregate score of 51 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 6 reviews.<ref name= \"MC\"/>\n\n''[[Destructoid]]'' criticized the gameplay as being too confusing, and gave the game a review score of 4 out of 10.<ref name= \"Destruct\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' gave the game a positive review score of 4 out of 5 stars saying that they liked the reworked mechanics, darker and emotional storyline, scary jumpscares, and sad ending but noted the game's bugs and glitches.<ref name= \"The Escapist\">{{cite web|url= http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/14363-Five-Nights-at-Freddy-s-4-Review-Worth-Playing|title= Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Review - Change, Improve, Jumpscare|author= Angelo M.
