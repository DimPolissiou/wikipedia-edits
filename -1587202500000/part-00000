[[Hugh Jenkins, Baron Jenkins of Putney]] served at the station, as did [[Andrew Humphrey]] (later [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] from 1976 to 1977, who flew [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s with [[No. 266 Squadron RAF|266 Squadron]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31263|title=Marshal of the RAF Sir Andrew Humphrey|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war use===\n[[File:RAF Wittering - 9 May 1944 Airphoto.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Wittering airfield, 9 May 1944|left]]\n\n==== Bomber Command ====\nImmediately after the war RAF Wittering, once again, transferred back to Fighter Command in 1946 providing a home to a variety of squadrons operating Spitfires, Mosquitos and Hornets.  In 1948, the Station transferred back to Training Command for 2 years before Maintenance Command took responsibility to undertake some significant redevelopment between 1950 and 1952 as the Cold War saw RAF Wittering become a vital part of the United Kingdom's strategic [[nuclear deterrent]] under the control of Bomber Command in 1953.{{Sfn|Birtles|2012|p=75}}\n\nThe current airfield was created by the merging of RAF Wittering and nearby Collyweston Relief Landing Ground, by the construction of a 1.7-mile runway between them in 1941.  Conversion to a Bomber airfield saw the construction of a new concrete runway (slightly to the south of the 1941 runway), taxiways and dispersals (with further H-dispersals and QRA dispersals being added later) that still form the majority of the Station's aircraft operating surfaces.  A wide-span Gaydon hangar for the [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra B2]] bombers was constructed along with a new control tower, avionics building and nuclear storage and maintenance facilities.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1402766|desc=Gaydon hangar at RAF Wittering}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RAF Victor B.2.jpg|thumb|RAF Victor B.2]]In its new guise as a bomber station, RAF Wittering initially operated [[Avro Lincoln]]s from 1953 although these were replaced by [[English Electric Canberra]]s later that year.{{Sfn|Birtles|2012|p=75}} The first British operational atomic bomb, the [[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|Blue Danube]], was deployed to RAF Wittering in November 1953.{{Sfn|Birtles|2012|p=75}} The first V-bombers (the [[Vickers Valiant]], the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]]) were delivered in July 1955. In 1957\u201358 tests were carried out on the first British hydrogen bomb. This was fitted into the existing Blue Danube casing, and four Valiant bombers flew out of Wittering to Christmas Island in the Pacific, one of them dropping the first device on 15 May 1957 on [[Operation Grapple]].{{Sfn|Oulton|1987|p=223}}\n\nUntil January 1969 two squadrons (100 and 139) of Victor B.2 bombers equipped with [[Blue Steel missile|Blue Steel]] stand-off missiles were part of the QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) force of the RAF. Two nuclear armed aircraft were permanently on 15 minutes readiness to take off. They were parked within {{Convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} of the westerly runway threshold. In times of higher tension, four bombers could be stationed beside the runway on the ORP (Operational Readiness Platform). If the aircraft were manned they could all be airborne within 30 seconds, a feat often demonstrated at V force stations across the country. Since the incoming missile warning from the [[RAF Fylingdales]] [[BMEWS]] array was only four minutes before impact this ensured if the country came under attack, the bombers would be scrambled and able to retaliate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britainatwar.keypublishing.com/2018/10/26/victors-on-quick-reaction-alert-1965-footage/|title=Victors on Quick Reaction Alert|publisher=Britain at War|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the base became part of [[RAF Strike Command|Strike Command]].

Although [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] in [[Lincolnshire]] is the nearest town, the runways of RAF Wittering cross the boundary between Cambridgeshire and [[Northamptonshire]].\n\n==History==\n\n===First World War===\nWittering's use as a military airfield dates back to 5 May 1916 when it began as [[Royal Flying Corps|RFC]] Stamford. The aerodrome was initially created for A Flight of [[No. 38 Squadron RAF|No. 38 (Home Defence) Squadron]].{{Sfn|Jefford|1988|p=37}}  In common with other Home Defence squadrons at the time it was used for training during the day and for air defence at night.  From the Flight's operational declaration in December 1916 until it deployed to France in November 1917, its [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|BE2c]]<nowiki/>s, [[Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.7|RE7]]<nowiki/>s [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2|and FE2b]]<nowiki/>s claimed engagements with several [[Zeppelin]]s.

A significant amount of development took place to re-open the station including four new accommodation blocks for airmen, a corporals and airmen's institute, a Senior Non-Commissioned Officers' [[Mess]], the Officers' Mess,<ref group=\"note\">'The Station's Officers' Mess is one few that predates College Hall Officers' Mess at Cranwell</ref> and a new guardroom.  The station retained two aircraft hangars from 1917 and an aircraft repair shed.  The [[Central Flying School]] was at Wittering from 1926 until 1935 being replaced by No. 11 Flying Training School until 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfrss.org.uk/News/2015/02/Flying-Squadrons-Return-To-Royal-Air-Force-Wittering/|title=Flying Squadrons Return To Royal Air Force Wittering|publisher=British Forces Resettlement Services|date=5 February 2015|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Preparation for War \u2013 Fighter Command ====\nIn April 1938, the station became a [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]] station within [[No. 12 Group RAF|No 12 Group]].

During the Battle of Britain many squadrons were rotated through Wittering to spells in the south of England with [[No. 11 Group RAF|No. 11 Group]] that was bearing the brunt of the battle.  With many of the Luftwaffe raids during the Blitz taking part at night, Wittering-based squadrons were instrumental in the development of night combat techniques. These included the use of the [[Turbinlite]] aircraft which replaced the nose with a powerful searchlight insulated in the nose of [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Havocs and Bostons]]. In April 1943 [[No. 141 Squadron RAF|No. 141 Squadron]] were moved in, operating [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es.{{Sfn|Jefford|1988|p=60}}   1943 also saw the station host 2 [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] squadrons, albeit temporarily: [[63d Fighter Squadron|63 Fighter Squadron]] USAAF with its P47s operated from Wittering between January and March before moving to [[RAF Horsham St Faith]]; 55 Fighter Squadron operated its P38s and P51s from Wittering between August and March 1944 before moving to nearby [[RAF Kings Cliffe|RAF Kingscliffe]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.shaw.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3468 |author=Staff writer, no byline|title=Library: Fact Sheet 55th Fighter Squadron|date=10 July 2009|publisher=20th Fighter Wing Public Affairs|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150926190130/http://www.shaw.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3468 |archivedate=26 September 2015|accessdate=26 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RAF_Wittering_aerial_photograph_WWII_IWM_HU_91901.jpg|left|thumb|RAF Wittering after the attack on 14 March 1941.

[[Basil Embry|Embry]] in ''Mission Completed'' states that in 1940 (the station's official history indicates that this was actually in 1941<ref>{{Cite book|title=Royal Air Force Wittering \u2013 from century to century 1916\u20132016|author1=Lloyd, Furz |author2=Walsh, Tony |author3=Montellier, Clive |author4=Palmer, E |year=2016|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/rafwittering/rafcms/mediafiles/C6A0B4E1_B5FD_F7D4_93EA68A8D6F1FE8F.pdf|pages=20}}</ref>), while used by 25 squadron, equipped with Beaufighter night fighters, the runway was extended from 1,400 yards to 3 miles long to reduce landing accidents at night and in bad weather.<ref name=chs/>\n\nThe Station's innovative role continued and developed throughout the war.  It became the home of both fighter and gunnery research and development units working with new equipment and techniques.  In addition, [[No. 1426 Flight RAF|No. 1426 (Captured Enemy Aircraft) Flight]] (colloquially known as the RAFwaffe) was based at Collyweston Landing Ground with its wide range of captured Luftwaffe aircraft both evaluating their performance and touring allied bases. In January 1945, the captured enemy aircraft were removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322222730/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3897/is_200302/ai_n9204393|title= The Rafwaffe|first=Peter |last=Gosling|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Flight Journal|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, the airfield was bombed five times, with seventeen people being killed on 14 March 1941. Aircraft from the station downed 151 Luftwaffe aeroplanes and 89 [[V-1 flying bomb]]s. [[Hugh Jenkins, Baron Jenkins of Putney]] served at the station, as did [[Andrew Humphrey]] (later [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] from 1976 to 1977, who flew [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s with [[No. 266 Squadron RAF|266 Squadron]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31263|title=Marshal of the RAF Sir Andrew Humphrey|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war use===\n[[File:RAF Wittering - 9 May 1944 Airphoto.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Wittering airfield, 9 May 1944|left]]\n\n==== Bomber Command ====\nImmediately after the war RAF Wittering, once again, transferred back to Fighter Command in 1946 providing a home to a variety of squadrons operating Spitfires, Mosquitos and Hornets.  In 1948, the Station transferred back to Training Command for 2 years before Maintenance Command took responsibility to undertake some significant redevelopment between 1950 and 1952 as the Cold War saw RAF Wittering become a vital part of the United Kingdom's strategic [[nuclear deterrent]] under the control of Bomber Command in 1953.{{Sfn|Birtles|2012|p=75}}\n\nThe current airfield was created by the merging of RAF Wittering and nearby Collyweston Relief Landing Ground, by the construction of a 1.7-mile runway between them in 1941.  Conversion to a Bomber airfield saw the construction of a new concrete runway (slightly to the south of the 1941 runway), taxiways and dispersals (with further H-dispersals and QRA dispersals being added later) that still form the majority of the Station's aircraft operating surfaces.  A wide-span Gaydon hangar for the [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra B2]] bombers was constructed along with a new control tower, avionics building and nuclear storage and maintenance facilities.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1402766|desc=Gaydon hangar at RAF Wittering}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RAF Victor B.2.jpg|thumb|RAF Victor B.2]]In its new guise as a bomber station, RAF Wittering initially operated [[Avro Lincoln]]s from 1953 although these were replaced by [[English Electric Canberra]]s later that year.{{Sfn|Birtles|2012|p=75}} The first British operational atomic bomb, the [[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|Blue Danube]], was deployed to RAF Wittering in November 1953.{{Sfn|Birtles|2012|p=75}} The first V-bombers (the [[Vickers Valiant]], the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]]) were delivered in July 1955. In 1957\u201358 tests were carried out on the first British hydrogen bomb. This was fitted into the existing Blue Danube casing, and four Valiant bombers flew out of Wittering to Christmas Island in the Pacific, one of them dropping the first device on 15 May 1957 on [[Operation Grapple]].{{Sfn|Oulton|1987|p=223}}\n\nUntil January 1969 two squadrons (100 and 139) of Victor B.2 bombers equipped with [[Blue Steel missile|Blue Steel]] stand-off missiles were part of the QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) force of the RAF. Two nuclear armed aircraft were permanently on 15 minutes readiness to take off. They were parked within {{Convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} of the westerly runway threshold. In times of higher tension, four bombers could be stationed beside the runway on the ORP (Operational Readiness Platform). If the aircraft were manned they could all be airborne within 30 seconds, a feat often demonstrated at V force stations across the country. Since the incoming missile warning from the [[RAF Fylingdales]] [[BMEWS]] array was only four minutes before impact this ensured if the country came under attack, the bombers would be scrambled and able to retaliate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britainatwar.keypublishing.com/2018/10/26/victors-on-quick-reaction-alert-1965-footage/|title=Victors on Quick Reaction Alert|publisher=Britain at War|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the base became part of [[RAF Strike Command|Strike Command]].

The AIYM immediately engaged itself in two issues. It appealed to its caste members in all regions to add''Yadav'' to their names and at the same time launched on a major programme of social reform.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}<!-- <ref>[http://www.cscsarchive.org/MediaArchive/audience.nsf/(docid)/0879F8EFAD3A0BE3652569410032A35C]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> -->\n\nIn the mid-20th century the Mahasabha pressed the [[Government of India]] to form a Yadav regiment in the [[Indian Army]], following their performance in the [[1962 Indo-China war]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Dipankar Gupta|title=Caste in question: identity or hierarchy?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgpEIb4tNjgC&pg=PT15|accessdate=28 March 2011|date=1 October 2004|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-3324-3|pages=15\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=G.S.
