It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]] from a screenplay by Raimi, his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] and [[Alvin Sargent]]. It is the third and final installment in Raimi's [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[James Cromwell]], [[Rosemary Harris]] and [[J. K. Simmons]]. Set shortly after the events of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] prepares his future with [[Mary Jane Watson]], he bonds with an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], bringing out his anger while facing three villains: [[Uncle Ben]]'s true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] after a freak accident; [[Harry Osborn]], who seeks to avenge his [[Norman Osborn|father]]; and [[Eddie Brock]], a rival photographer who becomes [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] after acquiring Peter's symbiote.\n\nDevelopment of ''Spider-Man 3'' began immediately after the release of ''Spider-Man 2'' for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer [[Avi Arad]], he added [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the producers also requested the addition of [[Gwen Stacy]]. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in January 2006, and took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Cleveland]] before moving to [[New York City]] from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] created over 900 [[visual effects]] shots. With an estimated production budget of $258 million, it was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time of its release.\n\n''Spider-Man 3'' premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2007]] and was the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest grossing franchises and film series|highest-grossing ''Spider-Man'' film]] until it was surpassed by ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home|Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, ''Spider-Man 3'' received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the performances, visual effects and action sequences, but criticized the overloaded storylines and [[subplot]]s and overabundance of villains. The majority of these issues were later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi and Arad.\n\nA fourth installment, titled ''Spider-Man 4'', was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a ''Venom'' spin-off film, but both were cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The ''Spider-Man'' film series was rebooted twice; first with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) by [[Marc Webb]] and starring [[Andrew Garfield]]; and later a new film series set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], directed by [[Jon Watts]] and starring [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], beginning with ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017). The ''Venom'' spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'', set within [[Sony's Marvel Universe]] directed by [[Ruben Fleischer]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\nA year after the events of the previous film, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] plans to propose to [[Mary Jane Watson]], who has just made her [[Broadway musical]] debut. Later, a meteorite lands at [[Central Park]], and an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] follows Peter to his apartment. [[Harry Osborn]], seeking vengeance after his father's death and having taken the performance-enhancing gas, attacks Peter with his [[Norman Osborn|father]]'s [[Green Goblin]] technology, but the battle ends with Harry unconscious and with [[amnesia]], erasing his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again. Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his [[DNA]] with the surrounding sand, he transforms into the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], who can control sand and reform his body with it.\n\nDuring a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving [[Gwen Stacy]]'s life, he kisses Gwen, infuriating Mary Jane. Meanwhile, Marko robs an armored car, subduing Spider-Man while escaping. [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], Gwen's father, informs Peter and his aunt [[Aunt May|May]] that Marko was the true killer of Peter's uncle [[Uncle Ben|Ben]]; the deceased [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]] had been Marko's accomplice. In his apartment, while Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit to wait for Flint, the symbiote assimilates the suit; Peter later awakens atop a building, discovering his costume has changed and his powers are enhanced; however, the symbiote brings out Peter's darker side and emotions. Spider-Man locates Marko and battles him in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Spider-Man destroys the pipe, causing its water to reduce Marko to mud and wash him away.\n\nPeter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering after she has been fired from her show. She shares a tender moment with Harry, but leaves afterward in regret. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged by a hallucination of his father, blackmails Mary Jane into breaking up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves \"somebody else,\" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Peter confronts Harry over this and spitefully tells Harry his father never loved him. Another fight ensues, with Harry throwing a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.\n\nAt the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', Peter exposes rival freelance photographer [[Eddie Brock]], who had falsified photos to depict Spider-Man as a criminal. Publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] fires Brock and makes Peter a staff photographer. Later, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to a nightclub where Mary Jane now works. Realizing this, Gwen leaves the nightclub while Peter attacks bouncers and accidentally hits Mary Jane. Peter realizes the symbiote is corrupting him and retreats to a church's bell tower where, upon realizing high-pitched sounds weakens the creature, he removes the symbiote. The symbiote bonds with Brock, transforming him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Brock/Venom locates Marko, who survived being washed away, and convinces him to join forces to defeat Spider-Man.\n\nBrock kidnaps Mary Jane and holds her as bait from a web high in a construction site, while Marko keeps police at bay. After Harry refuses to help Peter, he finally learns the truth about his father's death from his butler. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry arrives to help him with his Green Goblin technology. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], but Harry jumps in and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. He activates a pumpkin grenade from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote. However, Brock, who became addicted to the symbiote's influence, leaps into the symbiote in an attempt to save it, and gets killed along with the symbiote.\n\nAfterward, Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted Marko ever since. Peter forgives him, and Marko turns into a cloud of sand and peacefully flies away. Harry subsequently dies from his injuries. Following Harry's funeral, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile and share a dance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Spider-Man (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]: A superhero, a brilliant [[physics]] student at [[Columbia University]], and photographer for the ''Daily Bugle''.

It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]] from a screenplay by Raimi, his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] and [[Alvin Sargent]]. It is the third and final installment in Raimi's [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[James Cromwell]], [[Rosemary Harris]] and [[J. K. Simmons]]. Set shortly after the events of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] prepares his future with [[Mary Jane Watson]], he bonds with an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], bringing out his anger while facing three villains: [[Uncle Ben]]'s true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] after a freak accident; [[Harry Osborn]], who seeks to avenge his [[Norman Osborn|father]]; and [[Eddie Brock]], a rival photographer who becomes [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] after acquiring Peter's symbiote.\n\nDevelopment of ''Spider-Man 3'' began immediately after the release of ''Spider-Man 2'' for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer [[Avi Arad]], he added [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the producers also requested the addition of [[Gwen Stacy]]. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in January 2006, and took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Cleveland]] before moving to [[New York City]] from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] created over 900 [[visual effects]] shots. With an estimated production budget of $258 million, it was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time of its release.\n\n''Spider-Man 3'' premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2007]] and was the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest grossing franchises and film series|highest-grossing ''Spider-Man'' film]] until it was surpassed by ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home|Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, ''Spider-Man 3'' received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the performances, visual effects and action sequences, but criticized the overloaded storylines and [[subplot]]s and overabundance of villains. The majority of these issues were later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi and Arad.\n\nA fourth installment, titled ''Spider-Man 4'', was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a ''Venom'' spin-off film, but both were cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The ''Spider-Man'' film series was rebooted twice; first with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) by [[Marc Webb]] and starring [[Andrew Garfield]]; and later a new film series set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], directed by [[Jon Watts]] and starring [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], beginning with ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017). The ''Venom'' spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'', set within [[Sony's Marvel Universe]] directed by [[Ruben Fleischer]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\nA year after the events of the previous film, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] plans to propose to [[Mary Jane Watson]], who has just made her [[Broadway musical]] debut. Later, a meteorite lands at [[Central Park]], and an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] follows Peter to his apartment. [[Harry Osborn]], seeking vengeance after his father's death and having taken the performance-enhancing gas, attacks Peter with his [[Norman Osborn|father]]'s [[Green Goblin]] technology, but the battle ends with Harry unconscious and with [[amnesia]], erasing his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again. Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his [[DNA]] with the surrounding sand, he transforms into the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], who can control sand and reform his body with it.\n\nDuring a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving [[Gwen Stacy]]'s life, he kisses Gwen, infuriating Mary Jane. Meanwhile, Marko robs an armored car, subduing Spider-Man while escaping. [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], Gwen's father, informs Peter and his aunt [[Aunt May|May]] that Marko was the true killer of Peter's uncle [[Uncle Ben|Ben]]; the deceased [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]] had been Marko's accomplice. In his apartment, while Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit to wait for Flint, the symbiote assimilates the suit; Peter later awakens atop a building, discovering his costume has changed and his powers are enhanced; however, the symbiote brings out Peter's darker side and emotions. Spider-Man locates Marko and battles him in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Spider-Man destroys the pipe, causing its water to reduce Marko to mud and wash him away.\n\nPeter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering after she has been fired from her show. She shares a tender moment with Harry, but leaves afterward in regret. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged by a hallucination of his father, blackmails Mary Jane into breaking up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves \"somebody else,\" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Peter confronts Harry over this and spitefully tells Harry his father never loved him. Another fight ensues, with Harry throwing a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.\n\nAt the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', Peter exposes rival freelance photographer [[Eddie Brock]], who had falsified photos to depict Spider-Man as a criminal. Publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] fires Brock and makes Peter a staff photographer. Later, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to a nightclub where Mary Jane now works. Realizing this, Gwen leaves the nightclub while Peter attacks bouncers and accidentally hits Mary Jane. Peter realizes the symbiote is corrupting him and retreats to a church's bell tower where, upon realizing high-pitched sounds weakens the creature, he removes the symbiote. The symbiote bonds with Brock, transforming him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Brock/Venom locates Marko, who survived being washed away, and convinces him to join forces to defeat Spider-Man.\n\nBrock kidnaps Mary Jane and holds her as bait from a web high in a construction site, while Marko keeps police at bay. After Harry refuses to help Peter, he finally learns the truth about his father's death from his butler. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry arrives to help him with his Green Goblin technology. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], but Harry jumps in and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. He activates a pumpkin grenade from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote. However, Brock, who became addicted to the symbiote's influence, leaps into the symbiote in an attempt to save it, and gets killed along with the symbiote.\n\nAfterward, Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted Marko ever since. Peter forgives him, and Marko turns into a cloud of sand and peacefully flies away. Harry subsequently dies from his injuries. Following Harry's funeral, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile and share a dance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Spider-Man (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]: A superhero, a brilliant [[physics]] student at [[Columbia University]], and photographer for the ''Daily Bugle''.

Notable members of this group are Indian sandalwood (''[[Santalum album]]'') and Australian sandalwood (''[[Santalum spicatum]]''); others in the genus also have fragrant wood. These are found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, Indonesia, Hawaii, and other [[Oceania|Pacific Islands]].\n* ''[[Santalum album|S. album]]'' is a threatened species indigenous to South India, and grows in the [[Western Ghats]] and a few other mountain ranges such as the [[Kalrayan]] and [[Shevaroy Hills]]. Although sandalwood trees in India, Pakistan, and Nepal are government-owned and their harvest is controlled, many trees are illegally cut down. Sandalwood oil prices have risen to $2,000 per kg recently. [[Pterocarpus santalinus|Red sanders]] is endemic to Seshachalam, Veliganda, Lankamala, and Palakonda hill ranges, distributed in districts of [[Kadapa]], [[Chittoor]], and [[Kurnool]] in [[Rayalaseema]] region and parts of [[Nellore]] and [[Prakasam district|Prakasam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Mysore (region)|Mysore region]] of [[Karnataka]] (formerly Mysore State), and marayoor forest in [[Kerala]], [[southern India]], is high in quality. New [[plantation]]s were created with [[Foreign aid|international aid]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] for economic exploitation. In [[Kununurra]] in Western Australia, Indian sandalwood is grown on a large scale. This species is the primary source of sandalwood used in commercial oil production and should not be confused with West Indian Sandalwood, ''Amyris balsamifera''.\n* ''[[Santalum ellipticum|S. ellipticum]]'', ''[[Santalum freycinetianum|S. freycinetianum]]'', and ''[[Santalum paniculatum|S. paniculatum]]'', the [[Hawaii]]an sandalwood (''{{okina}}iliahi''), were also used and considered high quality. These three species were exploited between 1790 and 1825 before the supply of trees ran out (a fourth species, ''[[Santalum haleakalae|S. haleakalae]]'', occurs only in subalpine areas and was never exported). Although ''S. freycinetianum'' and ''S. paniculatum'' are relatively common today, they have not regained their former abundance or size, and ''S. ellipticum'' remains rare.<ref>Wagner, W. L., D. R. Herbst, and S. H. Sohmer (1990). Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press.</ref><ref>[[Joseph Rock|Rock, J. F.]] (1913). The Indigenous Trees of the Hawaiian Islands. Honolulu.</ref>\n* ''[[Santalum spicatum|S. spicatum]]'' is used by [[Aromatherapy|aromatherapists]] and perfumers. The oil concentration differs considerably from other ''Santalum'' species. In the 1840s, sandalwood was Western Australia\u2019s biggest export earner. Oil was distilled for the first time in 1875, and by the turn of the 20th century, production of Australian sandalwood oil was intermittent. However, in the late 1990s, Western Australian sandalwood oil enjoyed a revival and by 2009 had peaked at more than {{convert|20000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year \u2013 much of which went to the fragrance industries in Europe. Although overall production has decreased, by 2011, a significant percentage of its production was heading to the chewing tobacco industry in India alongside Indian sandalwood \u2013 the chewing tobacco market being the largest market for both oils in 2012.\n* Other species: Commercially, various other species, not belonging to ''Santalum'' species, are also used as sandalwood.\n\nVarious unrelated plants with similarly scented wood or oil include:\n*''[[Adenanthera pavonina]]'' - sandalwood tree, red or false red sandalwood\n*''[[Baphia nitida]]'' - camwood, also known as African sandalwood\n*''[[Eremophila mitchellii]]'' - sandalwood; false sandalwood (also sandalbox)\n*''[[Myoporum platycarpum]]'' - sandalwood; false sandalwood\n*''[[Myoporum sandwicense]]'' - bastard sandalwood, false sandalwood\n*''[[Osyris lanceolata]]'' - African sandalwood\n*''[[Osyris tenuifolia]]'' - east African sandalwood\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sandal leaf.jpg|thumb|Sandalwood leaf]]\nProducing commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils requires ''Santalum'' trees to be a minimum of 15 years old (''S. album'') the age at which they will be harvested in [[Western Australia]] \u2013 the yield, quality and volume are still to be clearly understood. Yield of oil tends to vary depending on the age and location of the tree; usually, the older trees yield the highest oil content and quality.

The flavouring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.\n\n== Distillation ==\nSandalwood must be distilled so that the oil can be extracted from within. Many different methods are used, including [[steam distillation]], water distillation, CO<sub>2</sub> extraction, and solvent extractions. Steam distillation is the most common method used by sandalwood companies. It occurs in a four-step process, incorporating boiling, steaming, condensation, and separation. Water is heated to high temperatures (140-212&nbsp;\u00b0F) and is then passed through the wood. The oil is very tightly bound within the cellular structure of the wood, so the high heat of the steam causes the oil to be released. The mixture of steam and oil is then cooled and separated so that the essential oil can be collected. This process is much longer than any other essential oil's distillation, taking 14 to 36 hours to complete, but generally produces much higher quality oil. Water, or hydro, distillation is the more traditional method of sandalwood extraction which involves soaking the wood in water and then boiling it until the oil is released. This method is not used as much anymore because of the high costs and time associated with heating large quantities of water.\n\n== Religion ==\n===Hinduism===\n[[File:Ganesh in legno di sandalo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sandalwood carved statue of lord [[Ganesha]]]]\n\nIndian sandalwood is very sacred in the Hindu [[Ayurveda]] and is known in Sanskrit as ''chandana.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ayurveda-sedona.com/knowledge-center/herbs-plants-medicine/sandalwood/|title=Significance of Sacred Sandalwood Chandan in Ayurvedic Remedies, Spiritual Rituals and Medicine|website=ayurveda-sedona.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref> The wood is used for worshipping the god Shiva, and it is believed that goddess Lakshmi lives in the sandalwood tree.

''Chandanam'', further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments, and some other compounds, results in ''javadhu''. ''Kalabham, chandanam,'' and ''javadhu'' are dried and used as ''kalabham'' powder, ''chandanam'' powder, and ''javadhu'' powder, respectively. ''Chandanam'' powder is very popular in India and is also used in Nepal. In Tirupati after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In [[Hinduism]] and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies.\n\n===Jainism===\n[[File:Mahamastakabhisheka in 2006.jpg|thumbnail|[[Mahamastakabhisheka]] at Shravanabelagola]]\n\nSandalwood use is integral part of daily practices of Jainism. Sandalwood paste mixed with saffron is used to worship ''[[tirthankar]]'' Jain deities.

After the [[mobad|firekeeping priests]] complete the ceremony, attendees are allowed to come up to the ''afarganyu'' and place their own pieces of sandalwood into the fire. Fire has been a sacred symbol in the Zoroastrian religion since ancient times and it is considered very important to keep the fires in the temples constantly burning. Because of its high sensitivity to fire, sandalwood works very well for this. Also, the wood has been accepted by the [[Yasna]] and Yashts as an appropriate fuel for the fire. It is offered to all of the [[Fire temple#Classification|three grades of fire]] in the [[fire temple]], including the [[Atash Dadgah]]s. Sandalwood is not offered to the ''divo'', a smaller lamp that is kept in the homes of Zoroastrians. Often, money is offered to the ''[[mobad]]'' (for religious expenditures) along with the sandalwood. Sandalwood is called ''sukhad'' in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian community.]] The sandalwood in the fire temple is often more expensive to buy than at a Zoroastrian store. It is often a [[revenue|source of income]] for the fire temple.\n\n== See also ==\n[[Sandalore]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Mandy Aftel]], ''Essence and Alchemy: A Natural History of Perfume'', Gibbs Smith, 2001, {{ISBN|1-58685-702-9}}\n* Dorothy Shineberg (1967), ''They came for sandalwood; a study of the sandalwood trade in the South-West Pacific 1830-1865'', Melbourne, Melbourne University Press.\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Sandalwood}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074642/http://www.plantcultures.org/plants/sandalwood_landing.html Plant Cultures: botany, history and use of sandalwood]\n* [http://www.redlist.org/search/details.php?species=31852 IUCN Threatened Species: ''Santalum album'']\n\n{{Wood products}}\n\n[[Category:Wood]]\n[[Category:Incense material]]\n[[Category:Perfume ingredients]]\n[[Category:Endangered plants]]\n[[Category:Santalum|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2011}}\n[[File:Santalum paniculatum 1326.jpg|thumb|''Santalum paniculatum'' ({{okina}}iliahi), [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]]]]\n\n'''Sandalwood''' is a class of [[wood]]s from trees in the [[genus]] ''[[Santalum]]''.

Notable members of this group are Indian sandalwood (''[[Santalum album]]'') and Australian sandalwood (''[[Santalum spicatum]]''); others in the genus also have fragrant wood. These are found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, Indonesia, Hawaii, and other [[Oceania|Pacific Islands]].\n* ''[[Santalum album|S. album]]'' is a threatened species indigenous to South India, and grows in the [[Western Ghats]] and a few other mountain ranges such as the [[Kalrayan]] and [[Shevaroy Hills]]. Although sandalwood trees in India, Pakistan, and Nepal are government-owned and their harvest is controlled, many trees are illegally cut down. Sandalwood oil prices have risen to $2,000 per kg recently. [[Pterocarpus santalinus|Red sanders]] is endemic to Seshachalam, Veliganda, Lankamala, and Palakonda hill ranges, distributed in districts of [[Kadapa]], [[Chittoor]], and [[Kurnool]] in [[Rayalaseema]] region and parts of [[Nellore]] and [[Prakasam district|Prakasam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Mysore (region)|Mysore region]] of [[Karnataka]] (formerly Mysore State), and marayoor forest in [[Kerala]], [[southern India]], is high in quality. New [[plantation]]s were created with [[Foreign aid|international aid]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] for economic exploitation. In [[Kununurra]] in Western Australia, Indian sandalwood is grown on a large scale. This species is the primary source of sandalwood used in commercial oil production and should not be confused with West Indian Sandalwood, ''Amyris balsamifera''.\n* ''[[Santalum ellipticum|S. ellipticum]]'', ''[[Santalum freycinetianum|S. freycinetianum]]'', and ''[[Santalum paniculatum|S. paniculatum]]'', the [[Hawaii]]an sandalwood (''{{okina}}iliahi''), were also used and considered high quality. These three species were exploited between 1790 and 1825 before the supply of trees ran out (a fourth species, ''[[Santalum haleakalae|S. haleakalae]]'', occurs only in subalpine areas and was never exported). Although ''S. freycinetianum'' and ''S. paniculatum'' are relatively common today, they have not regained their former abundance or size, and ''S. ellipticum'' remains rare.<ref>Wagner, W. L., D. R.

The oil concentration differs considerably from other ''Santalum'' species. In the 1840s, sandalwood was Western Australia\u2019s biggest export earner. Oil was distilled for the first time in 1875, and by the turn of the 20th century, production of Australian sandalwood oil was intermittent. However, in the late 1990s, Western Australian sandalwood oil enjoyed a revival and by 2009 had peaked at more than {{convert|20000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year \u2013 much of which went to the fragrance industries in Europe.

The flavouring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.\n\n== Distillation ==\nSandalwood must be distilled so that the oil can be extracted from within. Many different methods are used, including [[steam distillation]], water distillation, CO<sub>2</sub> extraction, and solvent extractions. Steam distillation is the most common method used by sandalwood companies. It occurs in a four-step process, incorporating boiling, steaming, condensation, and separation. Water is heated to high temperatures (140-212&nbsp;\u00b0F) and is then passed through the wood. The oil is very tightly bound within the cellular structure of the wood, so the high heat of the steam causes the oil to be released. The mixture of steam and oil is then cooled and separated so that the essential oil can be collected. This process is much longer than any other essential oil's distillation, taking 14 to 36 hours to complete, but generally produces much higher quality oil. Water, or hydro, distillation is the more traditional method of sandalwood extraction which involves soaking the wood in water and then boiling it until the oil is released. This method is not used as much anymore because of the high costs and time associated with heating large quantities of water.\n\n== Religion ==\n===Hinduism===\n[[File:Ganesh in legno di sandalo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sandalwood carved statue of lord [[Ganesha]]]]\n\nIndian sandalwood is very sacred in the Hindu [[Ayurveda]] and is known in Sanskrit as ''chandana.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ayurveda-sedona.com/knowledge-center/herbs-plants-medicine/sandalwood/|title=Significance of Sacred Sandalwood Chandan in Ayurvedic Remedies, Spiritual Rituals and Medicine|website=ayurveda-sedona.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref> The wood is used for worshipping the god Shiva, and it is believed that goddess Lakshmi lives in the sandalwood tree. The wood of the tree is made into a paste using sandalwood powder, and this paste is integral to rituals and ceremonies, to make religious utensils, to decorate the icons of the deities, and to calm the mind during meditation and prayer. It is also distributed to devotees, who apply it to their foreheads or necks and chests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sandalwood - spiritual|url=http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/sandalwood_spiritual.html|website=Kew.org|accessdate=17 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510063821/http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/sandalwood_spiritual.html|archive-date=10 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Preparation of the paste is a duty fit only for the pure, so is entrusted only to [[Brahmin|priests]] when used in temples and during ceremonies.\n\nThe paste is prepared by grinding wood by hand with granite slabs shaped for this purpose. With the gradual addition of water, a thick paste forms (called ''kalabham'' \"\u0d15\u0d33\u0d2d\u0d02\" in  [[Malayalam language]] and ''gandha'' \u0c97\u0c82\u0ca7 in [[Kannada]]) and is mixed with [[saffron]] or other such pigments to make ''chandanam''. ''Chandanam'', further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments, and some other compounds, results in ''javadhu''. ''Kalabham, chandanam,'' and ''javadhu'' are dried and used as ''kalabham'' powder, ''chandanam'' powder, and ''javadhu'' powder, respectively. ''Chandanam'' powder is very popular in India and is also used in Nepal. In Tirupati after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In [[Hinduism]] and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies.\n\n===Jainism===\n[[File:Mahamastakabhisheka in 2006.jpg|thumbnail|[[Mahamastakabhisheka]] at Shravanabelagola]]\n\nSandalwood use is integral part of daily practices of Jainism. Sandalwood paste mixed with saffron is used to worship ''[[tirthankar]]'' Jain deities. Sandalwood powder is showered as blessings by Jain monks and nuns (''sadhus'' and ''sadhvis'') to their disciples and followers. Sandalwood garlands are used to dress the body during Jain cremation ceremonies. During the festival of [[Mahamastakabhisheka]] that is held once in every 12 years, the [[Gommateshwara statue|statue of Gommateshwara]] is then bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, [[turmeric]], and [[vermilion]].<ref>{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qqei_Wo1qXwC|title=Pilgrimage Centres of India|first=Brajesh|last=Kumar|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|date=2003|isbn=9788171821853|p=199}}</ref>\n\n===Buddhism===\nSandalwood is mentioned in various ''suttas'' of the [[P\u0101li Canon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/search_results.html?cx=015061908441090246348:dj4lxnh4dda&cof=FORID:9;NB:1&ie=UTF-8&q=sandalwood&sa=Search|title=Access to Insight Search Results|website=Accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> In some Buddhist traditions, sandalwood is considered to be of the ''padma'' ([[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]) group and attributed to  [[Amitabha Buddha]].

Those that are to be avoided are benzoin resin, frankincense, sandalwood, foreign produced incense that violate the Heavenly Law and so one must be careful to observe this.\"]</ref> In [[Korean Shamanism]], sandalwood is considered the [[holy tree|Tree of Life]].\n\n===Zoroastrianism===\n[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] offer sandalwood twigs to the ''afarganyu,'' the urn in which the fire is kept at the [[fire temple]] (called ''agiyari'' in Gujarati and ''dar-e mehr'' in Persian), to keep the fire burning during religious ceremonies. After the [[mobad|firekeeping priests]] complete the ceremony, attendees are allowed to come up to the ''afarganyu'' and place their own pieces of sandalwood into the fire. Fire has been a sacred symbol in the Zoroastrian religion since ancient times and it is considered very important to keep the fires in the temples constantly burning. Because of its high sensitivity to fire, sandalwood works very well for this. Also, the wood has been accepted by the [[Yasna]] and Yashts as an appropriate fuel for the fire. It is offered to all of the [[Fire temple#Classification|three grades of fire]] in the [[fire temple]], including the [[Atash Dadgah]]s. Sandalwood is not offered to the ''divo'', a smaller lamp that is kept in the homes of Zoroastrians. Often, money is offered to the ''[[mobad]]'' (for religious expenditures) along with the sandalwood. Sandalwood is called ''sukhad'' in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian community.]] The sandalwood in the fire temple is often more expensive to buy than at a Zoroastrian store. It is often a [[revenue|source of income]] for the fire temple.\n\n== See also ==\n[[Sandalore]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Mandy Aftel]], ''Essence and Alchemy: A Natural History of Perfume'', Gibbs Smith, 2001, {{ISBN|1-58685-702-9}}\n* Dorothy Shineberg (1967), ''They came for sandalwood; a study of the sandalwood trade in the South-West Pacific 1830-1865'', Melbourne, Melbourne University Press.\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Sandalwood}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074642/http://www.plantcultures.org/plants/sandalwood_landing.html Plant Cultures: botany, history and use of sandalwood]\n* [http://www.redlist.org/search/details.php?species=31852 IUCN Threatened Species: ''Santalum album'']\n\n{{Wood products}}\n\n[[Category:Wood]]\n[[Category:Incense material]]\n[[Category:Perfume ingredients]]\n[[Category:Endangered plants]]\n[[Category:Santalum|*]]\n", "name_user": "183.83.144.138", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Sandalwood nursery)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandalwood"}

Political ethno-religious interest groups, whose membership includes influential political, military and religious leaders, have thrived in Nigeria, though they were largely suppressed under military rule. Their [[paramilitary]] wings, formed since the country's return to civilian rule, have been implicated in much of the sectarian violence in the years following. The [[Arewa People's Congress]], the militia wing of the [[Arewa Consultative Forum]], the main political group representing the interests of northern Nigeria, is a well-funded group with military and intelligence expertise, and is considered capable of engaging in military action, including covert bombing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2014/05/19/revolt-in-the-north-interpreting-boko-harams-war-on-western-education-by-kirk-ross/ |title=Revolt in the North: Interpreting Boko Haram's war on western education |publisher=African Arguments |author=Kirk Ross |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Founding===\n[[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]] founded the sect that became known as Boko Haram in 2002 in Maiduguri, the capital of the north-eastern state of Borno.

The most successful of these was the attack on the army barracks in Bauchi. A spokesman for the group told BBC Hausa that the attack had been carried out, as a test of loyalty, by serving members of the military hoping to join the group. This charge was later refuted by an army spokesman who claimed: \"This is not a [[banana republic]]\". However, on 8 January 2012 the president would announce that Boko Haram had in reality infiltrated both the army and the police, as well as the executive, parliamentary and legislative branches of government. Boko Haram's spokesman also claimed responsibility for the killing outside his home in Maiduguri of the politician Abba Anas Ibn Umar Garbai, the younger brother of the Shehu of Borno, who was the second most prominent Muslim in the country after the [[Sultan of Sokoto]]. He added: \"We are doing what we are doing to fight injustice, if they stop their satanic ways of doing things and the injustices, we would stop what we are doing\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/06/boko-haram-claims-responsibility-for-bomb-blasts-in-bauchi-maiduguri/ |title=Boko Haram claims responsibility for bomb blasts in Bauchi, Maiduguri |work=Vanguard News |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |title=Boko Haram has infiltrated my govt \u2013Jonathan |work=Punch |author=Olalekan Adetayo |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043607/http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThis was one of several political and religious assassinations Boko Haram carried out that year, with the presumed intention of correcting injustices in the group's home state of Borno.

Media reported the JTF killed 20 to 45 civilians and razed 50 to 100 houses in the neighborhood. The JTF commander in Maiduguri denied the allegations. On November 2, witnesses claimed the JTF shot and killed up to 40 people during raids in Maiduguri. The army claimed it dismissed some officers from the military as a result of alleged abuses committed in Maiduguri, but there were no known formal prosecutions in Maiduguri by year's end.\n\nCredible reports also indicated&nbsp;... uniformed military personnel and [[paramilitary]] [[Nigerian Mobile Police|mobile police]] carried out summary executions, assaults, torture, and other abuses throughout Bauchi, Borno, [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], and Yobe states&nbsp;...

Security forces generally operated with impunity in the illegal apprehension, detention, and sometimes [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]] [[execution]] of criminal suspects. The reports of state or federal panels of inquiry investigating [[suspicious death]]s remained unpublished.\n\nThere were no new developments in the case of five police officers accused of executing Muhammad Yusuf in 2009 at a state police headquarters. In July 2011 authorities arraigned five police officers in the federal high court in Abuja for the [[murder]] of Yusuf. The court granted bail to four of the officers, while one remained in custody.\n\nPolice use of excessive force, including use of live ammunition, to disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings during the year. For example, although the January fuel subsidy demonstrations generally remained peaceful, security forces reportedly fired on protesters in various states across the country during those demonstrations, resulting in 10 to 15 deaths and an unknown number of wounded.\n\nDespite some improvements resulting from the closure of police checkpoints in many parts of the country, states with an increased security presence due to the activities of Boko Haram experienced a rise in violence and lethal force at police and military [[roadblock]]s.\n\nContinuing abductions of civilians by criminal groups occurred in the Niger Delta and [[Biafra|Southeast]]&nbsp;...

Al-Qaeda takes the view that the general population should be viewed as Muslim and thus killing civilians is not acceptable.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-boko-haram-nigeria-20150115-story.html |title=How to help Nigerians defeat Boko Haram |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2014, Shekau released a 16-minute video where he voiced support for [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]'s head [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], al-Qaeda's head [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and Afghan Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/africa/2014/07/13/Boko-Haram-voices-support-for-ISIS-Baghdadi.html |title=Boko Haram voices support for ISIS' Baghdadi |website=English.alarabiya.net |accessdate=2016-05-22}}</ref> In March 2015, Shekau formally pledged allegiance to ISIL, which was accepted by the group's spokesman several days later.<ref name=\"BokoHaramIS\"/> The group was nominally renamed 'Wilayat Garb Ifriqiyah' or the Islamic State's 'West African province' and was led by Shekau.\n\nIn August 2016, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] attempted to remove Shekau from his leadership role and replace him with [[Abu Musab al-Barnawi]]. The reason behind this was that Shekau had disobeyed [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]]'s order to cease targeting Muslim civilians. Shekau rejected the move, leading to a split between the groups.\n\n==Response by Nigerian authorities==\nThe Nigerian military is, in the words of a former British military attach\u00e9 speaking in 2014, \"a shadow of what it's reputed to have once been. It's fallen apart\". They are short of basic equipment, including radios and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]]. Morale is said to be low. Senior officers are alleged to be skimming military procurement budget funds that are intended to pay for the standard issue equipment of soldiers. The country's defense budget accounts for more than a third of the security budget of $5.8 billion, but only 10 percent is allocated to capital spending.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/09/us-nigeria-military-insight-idUSBREA4809220140509 |title=Boko Haram exploits Nigeria's slow military decline|work=Reuters |author=Tim Cocks |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> A 2014 [[United States Department of Defense]] assessment stated, funds are being \"skimmed off the top\", troops are \"showing signs of real fear\" and are \"afraid to even engage\".<ref name=\"Congressional\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nIn the summer of 2013, the Nigerian military shut down mobile phone coverage in the three north-eastern states to disrupt the group's communication and ability to detonate IEDs. Accounts from military insiders and data of Boko Haram incidences before, during and after the mobile phone blackout suggest that the shut down was 'successful' from a military- tactical point of view. However it angered citizens in the region (owing to negative social and economic consequences of the mobile shutdown) and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens and organizations developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the [[Sambisa Forest]]. This fundamentally changed the dynamics of the conflict.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jacob | first1 = J.U.U. | last2 = Akpan | first2 = I | year = 2015 | title = Silencing Boko Haram: Mobile Phone Blackout and Counterinsurgency in Nigeria's Northeast region.

The Nigerian government claims that Boko Haram is \"the West Africa branch of the world-wide Al-Qaida movement\" with connections to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] in [[Somalia]] and AQIM in Mali.

The most successful of these was the attack on the army barracks in Bauchi. A spokesman for the group told BBC Hausa that the attack had been carried out, as a test of loyalty, by serving members of the military hoping to join the group. This charge was later refuted by an army spokesman who claimed: \"This is not a [[banana republic]]\". However, on 8 January 2012 the president would announce that Boko Haram had in reality infiltrated both the army and the police, as well as the executive, parliamentary and legislative branches of government. Boko Haram's spokesman also claimed responsibility for the killing outside his home in Maiduguri of the politician Abba Anas Ibn Umar Garbai, the younger brother of the Shehu of Borno, who was the second most prominent Muslim in the country after the [[Sultan of Sokoto]]. He added: \"We are doing what we are doing to fight injustice, if they stop their satanic ways of doing things and the injustices, we would stop what we are doing\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/06/boko-haram-claims-responsibility-for-bomb-blasts-in-bauchi-maiduguri/ |title=Boko Haram claims responsibility for bomb blasts in Bauchi, Maiduguri |work=Vanguard News |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |title=Boko Haram has infiltrated my govt \u2013Jonathan |work=Punch |author=Olalekan Adetayo |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043607/http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThis was one of several political and religious assassinations Boko Haram carried out that year, with the presumed intention of correcting injustices in the group's home state of Borno. Meanwhile, the trail of massacres continued relentlessly, apparently leading the country towards civil war. By the end of 2011, these conflicting strategies led observers to question the group's cohesion; comparisons were drawn with the diverse motivations of the militant factions of the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]].

Five officers were arrested for Yusuf's murder, which had no noticeable effect on the level of unrest. Opportunities for criminal enterprise flourished. Hundreds of police were dead and more than 60 police stations had been attacked by mid-2012.

Sectarian riots engulfed the twelve northern states of the country during the three days following the election, leaving more than 800 dead and 65,000 displaced. The subsequent campaign of violence by Boko Haram culminated in a string of bombings across the country on Christmas Day. In the outskirts of Abuja, 37 died in a church that had its roof blown off. One resident commented, \"Cars were in flames and bodies littered everywhere\", a phrase commonly repeated in international press reports about the bombings.

Media reported the JTF killed 20 to 45 civilians and razed 50 to 100 houses in the neighborhood. The JTF commander in Maiduguri denied the allegations. On November 2, witnesses claimed the JTF shot and killed up to 40 people during raids in Maiduguri.

The reports of state or federal panels of inquiry investigating [[suspicious death]]s remained unpublished.\n\nThere were no new developments in the case of five police officers accused of executing Muhammad Yusuf in 2009 at a state police headquarters. In July 2011 authorities arraigned five police officers in the federal high court in Abuja for the [[murder]] of Yusuf. The court granted bail to four of the officers, while one remained in custody.\n\nPolice use of excessive force, including use of live ammunition, to disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings during the year.

However it angered citizens in the region (owing to negative social and economic consequences of the mobile shutdown) and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens and organizations developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the [[Sambisa Forest]].
