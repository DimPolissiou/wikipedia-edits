The high point is Monte Calvo at {{convert|1065|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Most of the upland area, about {{convert|1,200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, is part of the [[Parco nazionale del Gargano|Gargano National Park]], founded in 1991.\n\nThe Gargano peninsula is partly covered by the remains of an ancient forest, ''Foresta Umbra'', the only remaining part in Italy{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} of the ancient [[oak]] and [[beech]] forest that once covered much of Central Europe as well as the [[Apennine deciduous montane forest]] [[biome]]. The Latin poet [[Horace]] spoke of the oaks of ''Garganus'' in ''[[Odes (Horace)#Book 2|Ode]]'' II, ix.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Puglia Mattinata1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The coast around Mattinata]]\nThe coast of Gargano houses numerous beaches and tourist facilities, including resorts such as [[Vieste]], [[Peschici]] and [[Mattinata]]. The two major [[salt lake (geography)|salt lake]]s of [[Lesina (lake)|Lesina]] and [[Lago di Varano|Varano]] are located in the northern part of the peninsula. Gargano is the site of the oldest shrine in [[Western Europe]] dedicated to the [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Michael]], [[Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano]].\n\nOther tourist attractions include [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], the Abbey of Santa Maria of Ripalta (Lesina) and the volcanic rocks, dating back to the [[Triassic]] Period, known as \"Black Stones\" in [[Rodi Garganico]], as well as the Sanctuary of San Nazario.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Annual events===\n*[[Primian|St Primiano]] and the saint sailing-race on 15 May \n*[[Nazarius and Celsus|St Nazario]] and the pilgrimage to the Sanctuary with the same name on July 28\n*[[Saint Roch|St Rocco's Day]] on 15, 16 and 17 August\n*Gargano Running Week is held in October, the first time in 2014 and includes [[trail running]], [[skyrunning]], jogging, [[ultra distance running]] and speed running.

Several of these animals were subject to [[island gigantism]].\n\n[[File:Puglia MonteSAngelo1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|250px|Monte Sant'Angelo on the slopes of Gargano]]\nThe [[fossil]]s are found in partially infilled paleokarst [[Karst topography#Karst formations|fissures]] across Monte Gargano. The Gargano Island fauna is known as ''[[Mikrotia]]'' fauna after an endemic [[rodent]] [[genus]] of the area. Initially named ''Microtia'', this had to be corrected, because the genus name ''[[Microtia (butterfly)|Microtia]]'' was already used for [[butterflies]].\n\nThe surface features of the ancient [[karst]] developed in [[Mesozoic]] [[limestone]]. In these, [[sediment]] accumulated together with the remains of the local fauna, forming thick layers of reddish, massive or crudely stratified [[silt]]y-[[sand]]y [[clay]]s, known as ''terrae rossae'' (\"red [[soil]]s\"). Through the mid-[[Pliocene]], some of these deposits were flooded, probably due to [[tectonic]] movement of the [[Apulian Plate]]. Others were overlaid by other sediments of [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] or [[freshwater]] origin. In this way a buried, partially reworked paleokarst originated.\n\nLater, as the [[ice ages]] cycle got underway, sea levels sank and the former island was continentalized. In the cool and [[semiarid]] conditions of the [[Early Pleistocene]] (some 1.8\u20130.8 mya) a second karstic cycle occurred, producing the neokarst which removed part of the paleokarst fill.\n\n===Fauna===\nThe Gargano Island endemic [[mammal]]s included:\n* ''[[Deinogalerix]]'' - 5 species of [[gymnure]]s (\"hairy hedgehogs\"), among them the giant ''D. koenigswaldi'' with a skull of c.20&nbsp;cm length. (Freudenthal, 1972; Butler, 1980)\n* ''[[Hoplitomeryx]]'' - some 5 species of \"prongdeer\" with five horns and sabre-like upper [[canine teeth]]. They ranged from tiny to the size of a [[red deer]], and large and small ones apparently occurred at the same time rather than one evolving from the other. (Leinders 1984, van der Geer 2005, van der Geer 2008)\n* ''Mikrotia'' - 3 or more species of [[murinae|murine]] rodent. The largest species, ''M. magna'', had a skull 10&nbsp;cm long.

(Freudenthal, 1985)\n\nNon-endemic mammals found on the island included:\n* ''[[Apodemus]] gorafensis'' - a field mouse\n* A prehistoric species of ''[[Cricetus]]'' [[hamster]] (Freudenthal, 1985)\n* ''Megacricetodon'' - another hamster (Freudenthal, 1985)\n\nBird species occurring at Gargano included (studied by Ballmann, 1973, 1976)<!-- (Ballmann, 1973, 1976) -->:\n* ''[[Apus (genus)|Apus]] wetmorei'', a [[swift (bird)|swift]].\n* ''[[Columba (genus)|Columba]] omnisanctorum'' - one of the oldest [[pigeon]] fossils known.

Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves [[immunoglobulin E]] and [[mast cell]] response.  Typically the allergy is limited to the seed [[storage protein]]s of wheat. Some reactions are restricted to [[wheat protein]]s, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy is rare.

The album was a major success, achieving platinum and gold certification around the world and spawning the hits \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" and \"[[She Bop]]\". In 1985, Lauper released \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", a single from the soundtrack to ''[[The Goonies]]'', and her second album, ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'', was released in 1986. ''True Colors'' was another successful album, along with the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|single of the same name]] and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> A starring role in the film ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' in 1988 led to the release of \"[[Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)]]\", which was a hit in Australia and New Zealand. Lauper's third album, ''[[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper album)|A Night to Remember]]'', was released in 1989. This album was less successful, despite the popularity of the first single, \"[[I Drove All Night]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> The following single, \"[[My First Night Without You]]\"<ref name=allmusic/> managed to chart in the top 60 in the United States.\n\nIn 1992, Lauper appeared in the English version of ''[[Starmania (musical)|Starmania]]'', a French [[rock opera]]. She released a single from the musical, \"[[The World Is Stone]]\", which was a major hit in several countries, particularly France. Her album ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'' was released in 1993 on [[Epic Records]], attaining gold certification in France and Japan. Lauper's greatest hits compilation, ''[[Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some]]'', was released in 1994, with the re-recorded version of \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" reaching number four in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. A compilation of Lauper's music videos and an interview was released at the same time on [[VHS]]. In 1996, she released ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and an original album of Christmas songs, ''[[Merry Christmas...Have a Nice Life]]'' in 1998.<ref name=allmusic/> These two albums were much less successful internationally than her previous releases, but both charted in Japan. ''Sisters of Avalon'' was also certified platinum in Japan.\n\nIn 2001, Lauper planned to release another album, ''[[Shine (Cyndi Lauper album)|Shine]]'', but the record company folded. An [[extended play]] version of the album was released to counter Internet [[Copyright infringement|piracy]], and the full album was released exclusively in Japan in 2004. In 2003, Lauper released her seventh studio album, ''[[At Last (Cyndi Lauper album)|At Last]]'', and a live version in 2004 on [[DVD]], ''Live... At Last''.<ref name=allmusic/> ''At Last'' is a set of covers that reinvent classic songs, such as the title track \"[[At Last]]\", \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" and \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\". The live DVD achieved gold certification in the United States. In 2005, Lauper released ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'', featuring new acoustic versions of her hits, such as a duet of \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" with [[Sarah McLachlan]]. Lauper's 2008 album, ''[[Bring Ya to the Brink]]'', was her first release in seven years containing original material, and met with considerable success. In December 2008 she recorded the duet \"[[A Christmas Duel]]\" with Swedish pop band [[The Hives]], released in Sweden only, where it reached number 4.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sverigetopplistan.se |title=Svenska Topplistan |language=Swedish}}</ref>  ''[[Memphis Blues (album)|Memphis Blues]]'', was released in 2010. It managed to be her highest-charting album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since ''True Colors'' in 1986, spending 13 consecutive weeks at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Blues chart, becoming the highest selling blues album of the year. So far, it has sold 600,000 copies worldwide.  Her most recent album is ''[[Detour (Cyndi Lauper album)|Detour]]'', released in 2016.  It is a country and western album inspired by some of her favourite artists growing up including [[Patsy Cline]].

The album was a major success, achieving platinum and gold certification around the world and spawning the hits \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" and \"[[She Bop]]\". In 1985, Lauper released \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", a single from the soundtrack to ''[[The Goonies]]'', and her second album, ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'', was released in 1986. ''True Colors'' was another successful album, along with the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|single of the same name]] and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> A starring role in the film ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' in 1988 led to the release of \"[[Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)]]\", which was a hit in Australia and New Zealand. Lauper's third album, ''[[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper album)|A Night to Remember]]'', was released in 1989. This album was less successful, despite the popularity of the first single, \"[[I Drove All Night]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> The following single, \"[[My First Night Without You]]\"<ref name=allmusic/> managed to chart in the top 60 in the United States.\n\nIn 1992, Lauper appeared in the English version of ''[[Starmania (musical)|Starmania]]'', a French [[rock opera]]. She released a single from the musical, \"[[The World Is Stone]]\", which was a major hit in several countries, particularly France. Her album ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'' was released in 1993 on [[Epic Records]], attaining gold certification in France and Japan. Lauper's greatest hits compilation, ''[[Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some]]'', was released in 1994, with the re-recorded version of \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" reaching number four in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. A compilation of Lauper's music videos and an interview was released at the same time on [[VHS]]. In 1996, she released ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and an original album of Christmas songs, ''[[Merry Christmas...Have a Nice Life]]'' in 1998.<ref name=allmusic/> These two albums were much less successful internationally than her previous releases, but both charted in Japan. ''Sisters of Avalon'' was also certified platinum in Japan.\n\nIn 2001, Lauper planned to release another album, ''[[Shine (Cyndi Lauper album)|Shine]]'', but the record company folded. An [[extended play]] version of the album was released to counter Internet [[Copyright infringement|piracy]], and the full album was released exclusively in Japan in 2004. In 2003, Lauper released her seventh studio album, ''[[At Last (Cyndi Lauper album)|At Last]]'', and a live version in 2004 on [[DVD]], ''Live... At Last''.<ref name=allmusic/> ''At Last'' is a set of covers that reinvent classic songs, such as the title track \"[[At Last]]\", \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" and \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\". The live DVD achieved gold certification in the United States. In 2005, Lauper released ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'', featuring new acoustic versions of her hits, such as a duet of \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" with [[Sarah McLachlan]]. Lauper's 2008 album, ''[[Bring Ya to the Brink]]'', was her first release in seven years containing original material, and met with considerable success. In December 2008 she recorded the duet \"[[A Christmas Duel]]\" with Swedish pop band [[The Hives]], released in Sweden only, where it reached number 4.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sverigetopplistan.se |title=Svenska Topplistan |language=Swedish}}</ref>  ''[[Memphis Blues (album)|Memphis Blues]]'', was released in 2010. It managed to be her highest-charting album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since ''True Colors'' in 1986, spending 13 consecutive weeks at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Blues chart, becoming the highest selling blues album of the year. So far, it has sold 600,000 copies worldwide.  Her most recent album is ''[[Detour (Cyndi Lauper album)|Detour]]'', released in 2016.  It is a country and western album inspired by some of her favourite artists growing up including [[Patsy Cline]].
