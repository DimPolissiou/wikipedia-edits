However, one self-described \"picker-upper of women\" preceding Weber was rational emotive psychotherapist [[Albert Ellis]], who wrote ''The Art of Erotic Seduction'', a how-to guide for men that encouraged them to meet women through the \"pickup\", with Roger Conway in 1967.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Albert|last2=Conway|first2=Roger|title=The art of erotic seduction|date=1967|publisher=Lyle Stuart|location=New York}}</ref> Ellis claimed he had been practicing seducing female strangers since he overcame his fear of approaching them through \"in-vivo desensitization\" in Bronx Botanical Garden in the 1930s.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe PUA community itself originated with [[Ross Jeffries]] and his students.

Such a person purportedly abides by a certain system deemed effective by that community in their attempts to seduce partners.\n\nThe use of ''pickup'' in this context, [[slang]] for making a casual acquaintance with a stranger in anticipation of sexual relations, was popularized by the 1970 book ''How to Pick Up Girls'' by Eric Weber,<ref>{{Citation | edition = 1st | title = How to Pick Up Girls | first = Eric | last = Weber | publisher = Symphony Press | place = Tenafly, NJ, USA | year = 1970}},</ref> and by ''Pick-Up Times'', a short-lived 1970s magazine, and the 1987 semi-autobiographical romantic comedy ''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pick-up Artist]]'', written and directed by [[James Toback]].<ref>Strauss (2005), pp. 124, 144.</ref> More recent works of pickup artist culture include [[Neil Strauss]]'s book, ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists]]'', and the 2007 [[VH1]] [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Pickup Artist (TV series)|The Pickup Artist]]'', starring the pickup artist [[Erik von Markovik|Mystery]].

These range from approaches that are very indirect, and which stress starting with casual conversation before building into a flirt, to methods in which attraction is communicated very openly and directly. Most PUAs acknowledge the distinction between so-called \"inner game\" and \"outer game\", where the former relates to techniques directed towards increasing one's self-confidence and mindset, whilst the latter are about actual interaction with real people. Inner game may involve taking greater care in one's looks and presentation, identifying and neutralising self-defeating mental habits (also known as \"limiting beliefs\"), and developing mental routines to build confidence. Outer game involves actual interaction with individuals and groups of people, from body language to conversation. The pick-up artist may frequent a self-help group and converse with MRA's (men's rights activists), [[incel]]s (involuntary celibates), and other PUA's to discuss techniques.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.avclub.com/the-matrix-couldn-t-dream-up-the-internet-of-2018-1822353087 |title = The Matrix couldn't dream up the internet of 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', [[Neil Strauss]] documents various practices among pickup artists.  Members of the community believe in achieving success with women through putatively scientific and [[Empiricism|empirical]] means, rather than by relying on good looks or instinct, or by following societal courtship conventions. The practice of going out with the purpose of meeting women is known as \"sarging\", a term coined by [[Ross Jeffries]], after his cat \"Sarge\". A pickup artist can \"sarge\" alone, or with a [[Wingman (social)|wingman]].<ref name=\"atlantic\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/pickup-artists-the-girliest-of-men/59578/ |title=Pickup Artists: The Girliest of Men |author=Megan McArdle |date=12 July 2010|work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nJeffries employed [[neuro-linguistic programming]] techniques for the purposes of sexual conquest, although Strauss claims in ''The Game'' that NLP was quickly rendered obsolete by the rise of techniques based on social dynamics, particularly [[Erik von Markovik]]'s \"Mystery Method\". The Mystery Method describes seduction as a linear process involving three stages (establishing attraction, building comfort, and seduction) each of which involves a variety of techniques.<ref name=autogenerated1>Erik von Markovik, \"The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed\", St Martin's Press, 2007</ref>\n\n\"[[Negging]]\", one of von Markovik's most famous and controversial techniques, has been described as the practice of giving a woman a backhanded compliment such as \"nice nails \u2013 are they real?\", to weaken her confidence and therefore render her more vulnerable to seduction,<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/cockblocked-by-redistribution|title = Cockblocked by Redistribution: A Pick-up Artist in Denmark|last = Baker|first = Katie J.M.|date = Fall 2013|work = Dissent Magazine|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}</ref> or that depriving a woman of obsequious validation and attention will influence her to seek it from the man who negs her.<ref>Belknap, S.

Hendriks in the journal ''[[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore|Cultural Analysis]]'', details the value system guiding successful pickup artists based on an international study including participant observation of bootcamp and \"lair\" meetings in Germany. The article argues that the values of successful practitioners of the \"Venusian arts\" are informed by an intertwining of \"hedonistic goals and diffused forms of [[Inner-worldly asceticism|innerworldly asceticism]]\". According to Hendricks, the hedonistic goal of sexual satisfaction interacts in a complex fashion with a set of \"disciplinarian and ascetic values\", and the author stresses that these disciplinarian and ascetic values are central to the value system of performant practitioners, even though the marketing of gurus often promises an easy, effortless \"quick fix\".<ref name=\"socrates.berkeley.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~culturalanalysis/volume11/vol11_Hendriks.html|title=Cultural Analysis, Volume 11, 2012: Ascetic Hedonism / Eric C.

These range from approaches that are very indirect, and which stress starting with casual conversation before building into a flirt, to methods in which attraction is communicated very openly and directly. Most PUAs acknowledge the distinction between so-called \"inner game\" and \"outer game\", where the former relates to techniques directed towards increasing one's self-confidence and mindset, whilst the latter are about actual interaction with real people. Inner game may involve taking greater care in one's looks and presentation, identifying and neutralising self-defeating mental habits (also known as \"limiting beliefs\"), and developing mental routines to build confidence. Outer game involves actual interaction with individuals and groups of people, from body language to conversation. The pick-up artist may frequent a self-help group and converse with MRA's (men's rights activists), [[incel]]s (involuntary celibates), and other PUA's to discuss techniques.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.avclub.com/the-matrix-couldn-t-dream-up-the-internet-of-2018-1822353087 |title = The Matrix couldn't dream up the internet of 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', [[Neil Strauss]] documents various practices among pickup artists.  Members of the community believe in achieving success with women through putatively scientific and [[Empiricism|empirical]] means, rather than by relying on good looks or instinct, or by following societal courtship conventions. The practice of going out with the purpose of meeting women is known as \"sarging\", a term coined by [[Ross Jeffries]], after his cat \"Sarge\". A pickup artist can \"sarge\" alone, or with a [[Wingman (social)|wingman]].<ref name=\"atlantic\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/pickup-artists-the-girliest-of-men/59578/ |title=Pickup Artists: The Girliest of Men |author=Megan McArdle |date=12 July 2010|work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nJeffries employed [[neuro-linguistic programming]] techniques for the purposes of sexual conquest, although Strauss claims in ''The Game'' that NLP was quickly rendered obsolete by the rise of techniques based on social dynamics, particularly [[Erik von Markovik]]'s \"Mystery Method\".

I can open with fluency, and there's an injection of confidence which comes from knowing exactly what you are going to say next.\" When he attracts a woman's attention, \"she is\u2014quite honestly\u2014looking at me like I'm the most fascinating person she's ever met.

Gurus sell workshops, books, [[e-books]], [[DVDs]], CDs and online video courses and video-call mentoring over the Internet.  In ''[[The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists|The Game]]'', Strauss describes the competition between gurus.  In The Journal, teaching of these methods is shown by way of 50+ examples.\n\n==Academic research==\nAn academic paper on the community, published in 2012 by Eric C. Hendriks in the journal ''[[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore|Cultural Analysis]]'', details the value system guiding successful pickup artists based on an international study including participant observation of bootcamp and \"lair\" meetings in Germany. The article argues that the values of successful practitioners of the \"Venusian arts\" are informed by an intertwining of \"hedonistic goals and diffused forms of [[Inner-worldly asceticism|innerworldly asceticism]]\". According to Hendricks, the hedonistic goal of sexual satisfaction interacts in a complex fashion with a set of \"disciplinarian and ascetic values\", and the author stresses that these disciplinarian and ascetic values are central to the value system of performant practitioners, even though the marketing of gurus often promises an easy, effortless \"quick fix\".<ref name=\"socrates.berkeley.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~culturalanalysis/volume11/vol11_Hendriks.html|title=Cultural Analysis, Volume 11, 2012: Ascetic Hedonism / Eric C.
