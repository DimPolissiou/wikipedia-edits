{"title_page": "Incidental music", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''Incidental music''' is [[music]] in a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[television]] program, [[radio]] program, [[video game]], film, or some other presentation form that is not primarily musical. The term is less frequently applied to [[film]] music, with such music being referred to instead as the \"[[film score]]\" or \"[[soundtrack]]\".'''\n\nIncidental music is often [[background music]], and is intended to add atmosphere to the action. It may take the form of something as simple as a low, ominous tone suggesting an impending startling event or to enhance the depiction of a story-advancing sequence. It may also include pieces such as [[overture]]s, music played during scene changes, or at the end of an [[act (theater)|act]], immediately preceding an interlude, as was customary with several nineteenth-century plays. It may also be required in plays that have [[musician]]s performing on-stage.\n\nThe use of incidental music dates back at least as far as [[Greek literature|Greek drama]]. A number of [[european classical music|classical]] [[composer]]s have written incidental music for various plays, with the more famous examples including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[Thamos, King of Egypt|''Thamos, King of Egypt'' music]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Egmont (Beethoven)|''Egmont'' music]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s [[Preciosa (Weber)|''Preciosa'' music]], [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Rosamunde|''Rosamunde'' music]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' music]], [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Manfred (Schumann)|''Manfred'' music]], [[Georges Bizet]]'s [[L'Arl\u00e9sienne (Bizet)|''L'Arl\u00e9sienne'' music]], and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s [[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|''Peer Gynt'' music]]. Parts of all of these are often performed in concerts outside the context of the play. Vocal incidental music, which is included in the classical scores mentioned above, should never be confused with the score of a [[Broadway musical|Broadway]] or [[film musical]], in which the songs often reveal character and further the storyline. Since the score of a Broadway or film musical is what actually makes the work a ''musical'', it is far more essential to the work than mere incidental music, which nearly always amounts to little more than a background score; indeed, many plays have no incidental music whatsoever.\n\nSome early examples of what were later called incidental music are also described as [[semi-opera]]s, quasi-operas, [[masque]]s, [[vaudeville]]s and [[melodrama]]s.\nIzuku(Deku)Midoryia\nThe genre of incidental music does not extend to pieces designed for concert performance, such as overtures named after a play, for example, Beethoven's ''[[Coriolan Overture]]'' (written for [[Heinrich Joseph von Collin]]'s tragedy), or [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' fantasy-overture.\n\nModern composers of incidental music include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Lorenzo Ferrero]], [[Irmin Schmidt]], [[Ilona Sekacz]], [[John White (composer)|John White]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].\n\n==Types==\n\n===Overture===\n{{main|Overture}}\nAn ''overture'' is incidental music that is played usually at the beginning of a film, play, opera, etc., before the action begins. It may be a complete work of music in itself or just a simple tune. In some cases it incorporates musical themes that are later repeated in other incidental music used during the performance.\n\n===Theme song===\n{{main|Theme music}}\nA ''theme song'' is a work that represents the performance and is often played at the beginning or end of the performance. Elements of the theme may be incorporated into other incidental music used during the performance. In films, theme songs are often played during [[credit roll]]s. A ''love theme'' is a special theme song (often in various modified forms) that accompanies romantic scenes involving the protagonists of a performance.\n\nTheme songs are among the works of incidental music that are most commonly released independently of the performance for which they were written, and occasionally become major successes in their own right.\n\n===Underscore=== <!-- Courtesy comment [[Underscoring]] links here -->\nAn ''underscore'' is a soft, noiseless soundtrack theme which accompanies the action in a performance. It is usually designed so that spectators are only indirectly aware of its presence. It may help to set or indicate the mood of a scene.\n\n===Stinger===\nA ''stinger'' is a very brief instant of music that accompanies a scene transition in a performance. Often the stinger marks the passage of time or a change in location. Stingers were used frequently in the American television series ''Friends'' (as one example){{citation needed|date=September 2015}} to mark scene transitions involving the passage of time or a change of location. Similar techniques are commonly used in many American sitcoms.\n\n===Loop===\nShort sequences of recorded music called ''loops'' are sometimes designed so that they can be repeated indefinitely and seamlessly as required to accompany visuals. These are often used as background music in documentary and trade films.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diegesis]], sections on the narrative uses of music in film and theatre\n* [[Plays with incidental music]]\n* [[Program music]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Harris, Steve.

''Argonaut'' was laid down as '''''V-4''''' on 1 May 1925 at [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 November 1927, [[Sponsor (military)|sponsored]] by Mrs. Philip Mason Sears, the daughter of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] William D. MacDougall, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 2 April 1928, [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] W.M. Quigley in command. Although never officially designated as \"SS-166\", at some point she displayed this number on her conning tower.<ref>[http://navsource.org/archives/08/168/0816656.jpg Photo of ''Argonaut'' at NavSource.org with \"166\" on the conning tower.]</ref>\n\n==Design==\n''V-4'' was the first of the second generation of [[V boat|V-boat]]s commissioned in the late 1920s, which remain the largest non-nuclear submarines ever built by the United States. ''V-4'' was the behemoth of its class. These submarines were exempt by special agreement from the armament and tonnage limitations of the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington Treaty]]. Her configuration, and that of the following ''V-5'' and ''V-6'', resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], suggested the need for long-range submarine \"cruisers\", or \"strategic scouts\", as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German \"U-cruisers\" of the [[German Type U 139 submarine|Type U-139]] and [[German Type U 151 submarine|Type U-151]] [[U-boat]] classes, although ''V-4'', ''V-5'', and ''V-6'' were all larger than these. ''V-4'' and her [[sister ship|near-sister]]s ''V-5'' ({{USS|Narwhal|SS-167|2}}) and ''V-6'' ({{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2}}) were initially designed with larger and more powerful [[MAN SE|MAN-designed]] diesel engines than the [[Busch-Sulzer]] engines that propelled earlier V-boats, which were failures. The specially built engines failed to produce their design power, and some developed dangerous crankcase explosions. ''V-4'' was ultimately completed with smaller MAN diesels of {{convert|1400|hp|abbr=on}}, compared with {{convert|2350|hp|abbr=on}} for ''V-5'' and ''V-6''. The smaller diesels were required to allow sufficient space for mine storage.\n\nThe engine specifications as built were two [[Bureau of Steam Engineering|BuEng]]-manufactured, [[MAN SE|MAN]]-designed direct-drive 6-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Four-stroke engine|4-cycle]] main [[diesel engine]]s, {{convert|1400|hp|abbr=on}} each.<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-specs\"/><ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-p259\"/> A BuEng MAN 6-cylinder 4-cycle auxiliary diesel engine of {{convert|450|hp|abbr=on}}, driving a [[Ridgway (electric motors)|Ridgway]]<ref name=\"Alden, p.211\">Alden, p.211.</ref> {{convert|300|kW|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Alden, p.211\"/> [[electrical generator]],<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-specs\"/><ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-p259\"/> was provided for charging batteries or for additional [[diesel-electric]] propulsion power.\n\nA more successful propulsion improvement in ''V-4'' was the replacement of earlier submarines' pairs of 60-[[electrochemical cell|cell]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] with a pair of 120-cell batteries, thus doubling the available voltage to the electric motors when submerged. This battery configuration would be standard until the [[GUPPY]] program following World War II. ''V-4'' and her sisters were slow in diving and, when submerged, were unwieldy and slower than designed. They also presented an excellent target for surface ship [[sonar]] and had a large turning radius.\n\nDesigned primarily as a minelayer, and built at a cost of [[United States dollar|US$]]6,150,000,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> ''V-4'' was the first and only such specialized type ever built by the United States. She had four [[torpedo tube]]s forward and two minelaying tubes aft. At the time of construction, ''V-4'' was the largest submarine ever built in the U.S., and was the largest in U.S. Navy service for 30 years.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/>\n\nHer minelaying arrangements were \"highly ingenious, but extremely complicated\",<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> filling two aft compartments.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> A compensating tube ran down the center of the two spaces, to make up for the lost weight as mines were laid, as well as to store eight additional mines.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> The other mines were racked in three groups around this tube, two in the fore compartment, one aft,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> with a hydraulically driven rotating cage between them.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> Mines were moved by hydraulic worm shafts, the aft racks connecting directly to the launch tubes,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> which had vertically sliding hydraulic doors<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> (rather than the usual hinged ones of torpedo tubes). Each launch tube was normally loaded with four mines,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> and a water 'round mines (WRM) tube flooded to compensate as they were laid, then pumped into the compensating tube.<ref>Alden, p.28-9.</ref> Eight mines could be laid in 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\">Alden, p.29.</ref>\n\n==Interwar period==\nFollowing commissioning, ''V-4'' served with Submarine Division 12 based at [[Newport, Rhode Island]].\n\nShe proved perennially underpowered, but engine replacement was postponed by war,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> and her [[MAN SE|MAN]] diesels were a constant source of trouble.<ref>Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1975).</ref>\n\nIn January\u2013February 1929, ''V-4'' underwent a series of trials off [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. On a trial dive during this period, she submerged to a depth of {{convert|318|ft|m|abbr=on}}. This mark was the greatest depth an American submarine had reached up to that time. On 26 February 1929, ''V-4'' was assigned to Submarine Division 20 ([[SubDiv]]&nbsp;20), and arrived at [[San Diego, California]] on 23 March. From there, she participated in battle exercises and made cruises along the West Coast.\n\nIn 1931, the ''V-4'' was heavily featured in \"Seas Beneath\", an American action film directed by John Ford.  The ''V-4'' was repainted to appear as a World War I German submarine, the fictional 'U-172'.\n\n''V-4'' was renamed '''''Argonaut''''' on 19 February 1931, and redesignated '''SM-1''' (submarine, minelayer) on 1 July. On 30 June 1932, she arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]], where she was assigned to SubDiv&nbsp;7. She carried out minelaying operations, patrol duty, and other routine work. In October 1934 and again in May 1939, ''Argonaut'' took part in joint Army-Navy exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. ''Argonaut'' became the [[flagship]] of [[Submarine Squadron 4]] (SubRon&nbsp;4). The submarine returned to the West Coast in April 1941 to participate in fleet tactical exercises.\n\n==World War II==\n\nOn 28 November 1941 ''Argonaut'', commanded by [[Stephen Barchet|Stephen G. Barchet]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Rear Admiral Barchet |url=http://fleetsubmarine.com/barchet.html |website=fleetsubmarine.com |accessdate=6 January 2020}}</ref> left [[Pearl Harbor]] to patrol around [[Midway Island]] with {{Ship|USS|Trout|SS-202|6}} as Midway Defense Group 7.2.  She was notified by radio of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] when she surfaced a few minutes after sunset on 7 December.  ''Argonaut'' set general quarters two hours later to investigate naval gunfire around Midway.  While designed as a minelayer and not an attack submarine, ''Argonaut'' made the first wartime approach on enemy naval forces; but poor maneuverability prevented reaching a suitable position for surfaced torpedo launch against the two Japanese [[destroyer]]s shelling Midway.  One of the destroyers saw ''Argonaut'' as she dived to make a submerged second approach in the bright moonlight; but the destroyer was unable to locate the submerged submarine, and ''Argonaut'' was again unable to maneuver into position to launch torpedoes.  After being held down all night, ''Argonaut'' surfaced at dawn to recharge batteries and was unsuccessfully bombed by a United States plane from Midway.<ref name=nhm>{{cite journal |last=O'Kane |first=Richard H. |year=1996 |title=Not 'Just Practice' |journal=Naval History |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=21\u201323 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\n''Argonaut{{'}}s'' dehumidifiers were ineffective at preventing condensation, which caused electrical fires making various pieces of electrical machinery inoperative.  Three crewmen were sick with high fevers, but President Roosevelt's mention of ''Argonaut{{'}}s'' contribution to the war effort in a radio speech encouraged Barchet to resist the temptation to abort the patrol.  By trimming the submarine 17 tons heavy, the crew was able to reduce diving time to 52 seconds by skillfully coordinated pumping between fore and aft ballast tanks; but that time was still considered too slow to avoid hostile aircraft.  ''Argonaut'' successfully rendezvoused with {{Ship|USS|Litchfield|DD-336|6}} at 06:00 20 January 1942, so the destroyer could escort her back to Pearl Harbor.<ref name=nhm/>\n\n===Conversion to troop transport===\nOn 22 January 1942, she returned to Pearl Harbor and, after a brief stop, proceeded to [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] for major overhaul. While there, her diesels were replaced with [[General Motors]] [[Electro-Motive Diesel|Winton]] 12-258Ss totaling {{convert|4800|hp|kW|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> with hydraulic drive through reduction gears,<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 176\"/> and her minelaying gear was removed to prepare for conversion to a troop transport submarine.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> The auxiliary diesel generator was replaced by a {{convert|300|kW|abbr=on}} GM Winton 8-268A and a {{convert|150|kW|abbr=on}} GM Winton 4-268A.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 176\"/> She was also fitted with a [[Torpedo Data Computer]]<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> (lack of which likely inhibited her ability to score with torpedoes), new electronics,<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> and two external stern torpedo tubes on the after casing, along with two stern deck stowage tubes. It appears she was not fitted with bow external torpedo tubes, as were ''Narwhal'' and ''Nautilus'', as photos taken after the refit do not show them.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pigboats.com/subs/v-boats2.html|title=PigBoats.COM - V-Class Submarines Page 2 Argonaut V-4|website=pigboats.com|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08166c.htm|title=NavSource.org USS Argonaut (SM-1) WW2 photos|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> On return to Pearl Harbor, the conversion to a troop transport submarine was \"hastily\" finished.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/>\n\n[[File:Makin Island Raid, August 1942.jpg|thumb|A Marine Raider, injured during the Makin operation, is lifted through a hatch on USS ''Argonaut'' to be taken ashore at Pearl Harbor, 26 August 1942.]]\n\n''Argonaut'' returned to action in the South Pacific in August. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]] assigned ''Argonaut'' and ''Nautilus'' to transport and land [[Marine Raiders]] on [[Butaritari|Makin Island]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]] for the [[Makin Raid]]. This move was designed to relieve pressure on American forces that had just landed on [[Guadalcanal]]. On 8 August, the two submarines embarked 120<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> troops of Companies A and B, [[Marine Raiders|2nd Raider Battalion]], and got underway for Makin. Conditions during the transit were unpleasant, and most of the marines became seasick. The convoy arrived off Makin on 16 August, and at 03:30 the next day the Marines began landing. Their rubber rafts were swamped by the sea and most of the outboard motors drowned. The Japanese\u2014either forewarned or extraordinarily alert\u2014were ready for the Americans' arrival. Snipers were hidden in the trees, and the landing beaches were in front of the Japanese forces instead of behind them as planned. However, by midnight of 18 August, the Japanese garrison of about 85 men was wiped out; radio stations, fuel, and other supplies and installations were destroyed, and all but 30 of the troops had been recovered.\n\n===Sinking===\n''Argonaut'' arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 26 August. Her [[hull classification symbol]] was changed from SM-1 to '''APS-1''' (transport submarine) on 22 September. She was never formally designated '''SS-166''', but that hull number was reserved for her and a photo shows she occasionally displayed it.<ref name=\"Register\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pigboats.com/subs/v-boats2.html|title=PigBoats.COM - V-Class Submarines Page 2 Argonaut V-4|website=pigboats.com|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> Her base of operations was transferred to [[Brisbane, Queensland]], later in the year. In December, she departed Brisbane under Lieutenant Commander John R. Pierce to patrol the hazardous area between [[New Britain]] and [[Bougainville Island]], south of [[Bismarck Archipelago]]. On 2 January 1943, ''Argonaut'' sank the Japanese [[gunboat]] ''Ebon Maru'' in the Bismarck Sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1943.html|title=The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II--1943|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> On 10 January, ''Argonaut'' spotted a [[convoy]] of five freighters and their escorting [[destroyer]]s\u2014{{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Isokaze|1939|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hamakaze|1940|2}}\u2014returning to Rabaul from Lae. By chance, an army aircraft\u2014which was out of bombs\u2014was flying overhead and witnessed ''Argonaut''\u2032s attack. A crewman on board the plane saw one destroyer hit by a [[torpedo]], and the destroyers promptly counterattacking. ''Argonaut''\u2032s bow suddenly broke the water at an unusual angle. It was apparent that a [[depth charge]] had severely damaged the submarine. The destroyers continued circling ''Argonaut'', pumping shells into her; she slipped below the waves and was never heard from again.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> One hundred and two officers and men went down with her, the worst loss of life for an American submarine in wartime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneternalpatrol.com/uss-argonaut-166.htm |title=On Eternal Patrol - USS Argonaut (APS-1), (SS-166) |last= |first= |website=On Eternal Patrol |publisher= |accessdate=18 November 2014 }}</ref> Her name was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 26 February.\n[[File:USS Argonaut ships bell.gif|thumb|right|USS Argonaut ships bell|The ship's bell of USS ''Argonaut'' - lost in combat in 1943 - \nstill serves in the [[Submarine Memorial Chapel]] at Pearl Harbor]]\nJapanese reports made available at the end of the war recorded a depth charge attack followed by gunfire, at which time they \"destroyed the top of the sub\".\n\nOn the basis of the report given by the Army flier who witnessed the attack in which ''Argonaut'' sank, she was credited with damaging a Japanese destroyer on her last patrol.

''Argonaut'' was laid down as '''''V-4''''' on 1 May 1925 at [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 November 1927, [[Sponsor (military)|sponsored]] by Mrs. Philip Mason Sears, the daughter of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] William D. MacDougall, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 2 April 1928, [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] W.M. Quigley in command. Although never officially designated as \"SS-166\", at some point she displayed this number on her conning tower.<ref>[http://navsource.org/archives/08/168/0816656.jpg Photo of ''Argonaut'' at NavSource.org with \"166\" on the conning tower.]</ref>\n\n==Design==\n''V-4'' was the first of the second generation of [[V boat|V-boat]]s commissioned in the late 1920s, which remain the largest non-nuclear submarines ever built by the United States. ''V-4'' was the behemoth of its class. These submarines were exempt by special agreement from the armament and tonnage limitations of the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington Treaty]]. Her configuration, and that of the following ''V-5'' and ''V-6'', resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], suggested the need for long-range submarine \"cruisers\", or \"strategic scouts\", as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German \"U-cruisers\" of the [[German Type U 139 submarine|Type U-139]] and [[German Type U 151 submarine|Type U-151]] [[U-boat]] classes, although ''V-4'', ''V-5'', and ''V-6'' were all larger than these. ''V-4'' and her [[sister ship|near-sister]]s ''V-5'' ({{USS|Narwhal|SS-167|2}}) and ''V-6'' ({{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2}}) were initially designed with larger and more powerful [[MAN SE|MAN-designed]] diesel engines than the [[Busch-Sulzer]] engines that propelled earlier V-boats, which were failures. The specially built engines failed to produce their design power, and some developed dangerous crankcase explosions. ''V-4'' was ultimately completed with smaller MAN diesels of {{convert|1400|hp|abbr=on}}, compared with {{convert|2350|hp|abbr=on}} for ''V-5'' and ''V-6''. The smaller diesels were required to allow sufficient space for mine storage.\n\nThe engine specifications as built were two [[Bureau of Steam Engineering|BuEng]]-manufactured, [[MAN SE|MAN]]-designed direct-drive 6-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Four-stroke engine|4-cycle]] main [[diesel engine]]s, {{convert|1400|hp|abbr=on}} each.<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-specs\"/><ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-p259\"/> A BuEng MAN 6-cylinder 4-cycle auxiliary diesel engine of {{convert|450|hp|abbr=on}}, driving a [[Ridgway (electric motors)|Ridgway]]<ref name=\"Alden, p.211\">Alden, p.211.</ref> {{convert|300|kW|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Alden, p.211\"/> [[electrical generator]],<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-specs\"/><ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-p259\"/> was provided for charging batteries or for additional [[diesel-electric]] propulsion power.\n\nA more successful propulsion improvement in ''V-4'' was the replacement of earlier submarines' pairs of 60-[[electrochemical cell|cell]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] with a pair of 120-cell batteries, thus doubling the available voltage to the electric motors when submerged. This battery configuration would be standard until the [[GUPPY]] program following World War II. ''V-4'' and her sisters were slow in diving and, when submerged, were unwieldy and slower than designed. They also presented an excellent target for surface ship [[sonar]] and had a large turning radius.\n\nDesigned primarily as a minelayer, and built at a cost of [[United States dollar|US$]]6,150,000,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> ''V-4'' was the first and only such specialized type ever built by the United States. She had four [[torpedo tube]]s forward and two minelaying tubes aft. At the time of construction, ''V-4'' was the largest submarine ever built in the U.S., and was the largest in U.S. Navy service for 30 years.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/>\n\nHer minelaying arrangements were \"highly ingenious, but extremely complicated\",<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> filling two aft compartments.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> A compensating tube ran down the center of the two spaces, to make up for the lost weight as mines were laid, as well as to store eight additional mines.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> The other mines were racked in three groups around this tube, two in the fore compartment, one aft,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> with a hydraulically driven rotating cage between them.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> Mines were moved by hydraulic worm shafts, the aft racks connecting directly to the launch tubes,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> which had vertically sliding hydraulic doors<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> (rather than the usual hinged ones of torpedo tubes). Each launch tube was normally loaded with four mines,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> and a water 'round mines (WRM) tube flooded to compensate as they were laid, then pumped into the compensating tube.<ref>Alden, p.28-9.</ref> Eight mines could be laid in 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\">Alden, p.29.</ref>\n\n==Interwar period==\nFollowing commissioning, ''V-4'' served with Submarine Division 12 based at [[Newport, Rhode Island]].\n\nShe proved perennially underpowered, but engine replacement was postponed by war,<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> and her [[MAN SE|MAN]] diesels were a constant source of trouble.<ref>Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1975).</ref>\n\nIn January\u2013February 1929, ''V-4'' underwent a series of trials off [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. On a trial dive during this period, she submerged to a depth of {{convert|318|ft|m|abbr=on}}. This mark was the greatest depth an American submarine had reached up to that time. On 26 February 1929, ''V-4'' was assigned to Submarine Division 20 ([[SubDiv]]&nbsp;20), and arrived at [[San Diego, California]] on 23 March. From there, she participated in battle exercises and made cruises along the West Coast.\n\nIn 1931, the ''V-4'' was heavily featured in \"Seas Beneath\", an American action film directed by John Ford.  The ''V-4'' was repainted to appear as a World War I German submarine, the fictional 'U-172'.\n\n''V-4'' was renamed '''''Argonaut''''' on 19 February 1931, and redesignated '''SM-1''' (submarine, minelayer) on 1 July. On 30 June 1932, she arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]], where she was assigned to SubDiv&nbsp;7. She carried out minelaying operations, patrol duty, and other routine work. In October 1934 and again in May 1939, ''Argonaut'' took part in joint Army-Navy exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. ''Argonaut'' became the [[flagship]] of [[Submarine Squadron 4]] (SubRon&nbsp;4). The submarine returned to the West Coast in April 1941 to participate in fleet tactical exercises.\n\n==World War II==\n\nOn 28 November 1941 ''Argonaut'', commanded by [[Stephen Barchet|Stephen G. Barchet]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Rear Admiral Barchet |url=http://fleetsubmarine.com/barchet.html |website=fleetsubmarine.com |accessdate=6 January 2020}}</ref> left [[Pearl Harbor]] to patrol around [[Midway Island]] with {{Ship|USS|Trout|SS-202|6}} as Midway Defense Group 7.2.  She was notified by radio of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] when she surfaced a few minutes after sunset on 7 December.  ''Argonaut'' set general quarters two hours later to investigate naval gunfire around Midway.  While designed as a minelayer and not an attack submarine, ''Argonaut'' made the first wartime approach on enemy naval forces; but poor maneuverability prevented reaching a suitable position for surfaced torpedo launch against the two Japanese [[destroyer]]s shelling Midway.  One of the destroyers saw ''Argonaut'' as she dived to make a submerged second approach in the bright moonlight; but the destroyer was unable to locate the submerged submarine, and ''Argonaut'' was again unable to maneuver into position to launch torpedoes.  After being held down all night, ''Argonaut'' surfaced at dawn to recharge batteries and was unsuccessfully bombed by a United States plane from Midway.<ref name=nhm>{{cite journal |last=O'Kane |first=Richard H. |year=1996 |title=Not 'Just Practice' |journal=Naval History |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=21\u201323 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\n''Argonaut{{'}}s'' dehumidifiers were ineffective at preventing condensation, which caused electrical fires making various pieces of electrical machinery inoperative.  Three crewmen were sick with high fevers, but President Roosevelt's mention of ''Argonaut{{'}}s'' contribution to the war effort in a radio speech encouraged Barchet to resist the temptation to abort the patrol.  By trimming the submarine 17 tons heavy, the crew was able to reduce diving time to 52 seconds by skillfully coordinated pumping between fore and aft ballast tanks; but that time was still considered too slow to avoid hostile aircraft.  ''Argonaut'' successfully rendezvoused with {{Ship|USS|Litchfield|DD-336|6}} at 06:00 20 January 1942, so the destroyer could escort her back to Pearl Harbor.<ref name=nhm/>\n\n===Conversion to troop transport===\nOn 22 January 1942, she returned to Pearl Harbor and, after a brief stop, proceeded to [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] for major overhaul. While there, her diesels were replaced with [[General Motors]] [[Electro-Motive Diesel|Winton]] 12-258Ss totaling {{convert|4800|hp|kW|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> with hydraulic drive through reduction gears,<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 176\"/> and her minelaying gear was removed to prepare for conversion to a troop transport submarine.<ref name=\"Alden, p.28\"/> The auxiliary diesel generator was replaced by a {{convert|300|kW|abbr=on}} GM Winton 8-268A and a {{convert|150|kW|abbr=on}} GM Winton 4-268A.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 176\"/> She was also fitted with a [[Torpedo Data Computer]]<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> (lack of which likely inhibited her ability to score with torpedoes), new electronics,<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> and two external stern torpedo tubes on the after casing, along with two stern deck stowage tubes. It appears she was not fitted with bow external torpedo tubes, as were ''Narwhal'' and ''Nautilus'', as photos taken after the refit do not show them.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pigboats.com/subs/v-boats2.html|title=PigBoats.COM - V-Class Submarines Page 2 Argonaut V-4|website=pigboats.com|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08166c.htm|title=NavSource.org USS Argonaut (SM-1) WW2 photos|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> On return to Pearl Harbor, the conversion to a troop transport submarine was \"hastily\" finished.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/>\n\n[[File:Makin Island Raid, August 1942.jpg|thumb|A Marine Raider, injured during the Makin operation, is lifted through a hatch on USS ''Argonaut'' to be taken ashore at Pearl Harbor, 26 August 1942.]]\n\n''Argonaut'' returned to action in the South Pacific in August. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]] assigned ''Argonaut'' and ''Nautilus'' to transport and land [[Marine Raiders]] on [[Butaritari|Makin Island]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]] for the [[Makin Raid]]. This move was designed to relieve pressure on American forces that had just landed on [[Guadalcanal]]. On 8 August, the two submarines embarked 120<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> troops of Companies A and B, [[Marine Raiders|2nd Raider Battalion]], and got underway for Makin. Conditions during the transit were unpleasant, and most of the marines became seasick. The convoy arrived off Makin on 16 August, and at 03:30 the next day the Marines began landing. Their rubber rafts were swamped by the sea and most of the outboard motors drowned. The Japanese\u2014either forewarned or extraordinarily alert\u2014were ready for the Americans' arrival. Snipers were hidden in the trees, and the landing beaches were in front of the Japanese forces instead of behind them as planned. However, by midnight of 18 August, the Japanese garrison of about 85 men was wiped out; radio stations, fuel, and other supplies and installations were destroyed, and all but 30 of the troops had been recovered.\n\n===Sinking===\n''Argonaut'' arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 26 August. Her [[hull classification symbol]] was changed from SM-1 to '''APS-1''' (transport submarine) on 22 September. She was never formally designated '''SS-166''', but that hull number was reserved for her and a photo shows she occasionally displayed it.<ref name=\"Register\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pigboats.com/subs/v-boats2.html|title=PigBoats.COM - V-Class Submarines Page 2 Argonaut V-4|website=pigboats.com|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> Her base of operations was transferred to [[Brisbane, Queensland]], later in the year. In December, she departed Brisbane under Lieutenant Commander John R. Pierce to patrol the hazardous area between [[New Britain]] and [[Bougainville Island]], south of [[Bismarck Archipelago]]. On 2 January 1943, ''Argonaut'' sank the Japanese [[gunboat]] ''Ebon Maru'' in the Bismarck Sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1943.html|title=The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II--1943|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> On 10 January, ''Argonaut'' spotted a [[convoy]] of five freighters and their escorting [[destroyer]]s\u2014{{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Isokaze|1939|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hamakaze|1940|2}}\u2014returning to Rabaul from Lae. By chance, an army aircraft\u2014which was out of bombs\u2014was flying overhead and witnessed ''Argonaut''\u2032s attack. A crewman on board the plane saw one destroyer hit by a [[torpedo]], and the destroyers promptly counterattacking. ''Argonaut''\u2032s bow suddenly broke the water at an unusual angle. It was apparent that a [[depth charge]] had severely damaged the submarine. The destroyers continued circling ''Argonaut'', pumping shells into her; she slipped below the waves and was never heard from again.<ref name=\"Alden, p.29\"/> One hundred and two officers and men went down with her, the worst loss of life for an American submarine in wartime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneternalpatrol.com/uss-argonaut-166.htm |title=On Eternal Patrol - USS Argonaut (APS-1), (SS-166) |last= |first= |website=On Eternal Patrol |publisher= |accessdate=18 November 2014 }}</ref> Her name was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 26 February.\n[[File:USS Argonaut ships bell.gif|thumb|right|USS Argonaut ships bell|The ship's bell of USS ''Argonaut'' - lost in combat in 1943 - \nstill serves in the [[Submarine Memorial Chapel]] at Pearl Harbor]]\nJapanese reports made available at the end of the war recorded a depth charge attack followed by gunfire, at which time they \"destroyed the top of the sub\".\n\nOn the basis of the report given by the Army flier who witnessed the attack in which ''Argonaut'' perished, she was credited with damaging a Japanese destroyer on her last patrol.

The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce, and available in great numbers. It was also the basis of several successful tank destroyers, such as the [[M10 tank destroyer|M10]], [[17pdr SP Achilles|Achilles]] and [[M36 tank destroyer|M36]]. Tens of thousands were distributed through the [[Lend-Lease]] program to the [[British Empire#Second World War|British Commonwealth]] and [[Soviet Union]]. The tank was named by the British for the American Civil War general [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].\n\nThe M4 Sherman evolved from the [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium Tank]],{{refn|Also known by the British service names \"Grant\" and \"Lee\".|group=N}} which had its main armament in a side [[sponson]] mount. The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design, but moved the main 75&nbsp;mm gun into a fully traversing central turret. One feature, a one-axis [[gyrostabilizer]], was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the reticle on target, so that when the tank did stop to fire, the gun would be aimed in roughly the right direction.<ref>Zaloga, Stephen J. ''Panther vs Sherman: Battle of the Bulge 1944''. Osprey Publishing, 2009, p. 28.</ref> The designers stressed mechanical reliability, ease of production and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight. These factors, combined with the Sherman's then-superior armor and armament, outclassed German [[light tank|light]] and medium tanks fielded in 1939\u201342. The M4 went on to be produced in large numbers, being the most produced tank in American history:<ref name=\"Hell\"/> The Soviets' [[T-34#Mass production|T-34 medium tank]] (total of some 64,549 wartime-produced examples, split roughly 55%-45% between 76&nbsp;mm and 85&nbsp;mm gunned examples) was the only tank design produced in larger numbers<ref name=\"Koshkin\">{{cite book|title=Stalin's Keys to Victory: The Rebirth of the Red Army|year=2007|publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA|isbn=978-0-8117-3423-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JE7Yd2sNBu4C&lpg=PA92&dq=%22T-34%22%20June%201941&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q=%22T-34%22&f=false |author=Walter S. Dunn, Jr}}</ref> during World War II. The Sherman spearheaded many offensives by the Western Allies after 1942.\n\nWhen the M4 tank went into combat in [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]] with the British Army at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] in late 1942, it increased the advantage of Allied armor over Axis armor and was superior to the lighter German<ref>{{cite book|last1=Luck|first1=Hans|title=Panzer Commander: The Memoirs of Colonel Hans von Luck|date=2013|publisher=Dell|page=Paragraph 6.75}}</ref> and Italian tank designs. For this reason, the US Army believed that the M4 would be adequate to win the war, and relatively little pressure was initially exerted for further tank development. Logistical and transport restrictions, such as limitations imposed by roads, ports, and bridges, also complicated the introduction of a more capable but heavier tank.<ref name=\"AGF 1943\">AGF policy statement. Chief of staff AGF. November 1943. MHI</ref>{{refn|An [[Army Ground Forces]] policy statement of November 1943 concluded thus: \"The recommendation of a limited proportion of tanks carrying a 90&nbsp; mm gun is not concurred in for the following reasons: The M4 tank has been hailed widely as the best tank of the battlefield today ... There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank.

These factors combined to give the Allies numerical superiority in most battles, and many infantry divisions were provided with M4s and tank destroyers.<ref group=N>By 1944, a typical U.S. infantry division had attached for armor support an M4 Sherman battalion, a tank destroyer battalion, or both.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Tank Tactics: From Normandy to Lorraine\" by Roman Jarymowycz {{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the Sherman, particularly the many improved and upgraded versions, continued to see combat service in many conflicts around the world, including the UN forces in the [[Korean War]], with Israel in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Arab\u2013Israeli wars]], briefly with South Vietnam in the [[Vietnam War]], and on both sides of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]].<ref name=Hunnicutt>Hunnicutt 1978{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==U.S. design prototype==\n[[File:Shermandriver.jpg|thumb|Cutaway Sherman showing transmission and driver's seat]]\n\nThe U.S. Army Ordnance Department designed the M4 medium tank as a replacement for the M3 medium tank. The M3 was an up-gunned development of the [[M2 Medium Tank]] of 1939, in turn derived from the [[M2 light tank]] of 1935. The M3 was developed as a stopgap measure until a new turret mounting a 75&nbsp;mm gun could be devised. While it was a big improvement when tried by the British in Africa against early German tanks, the placement of a 37&nbsp;mm gun turret on top gave it a very high profile, and the unusual side-sponson mounted main gun, with limited [[Gun laying|traverse]], could not be aimed across the other side of the tank. Though reluctant to adopt British weapons into their arsenal, the American designers were prepared to accept proven British ideas. British ideas, as embodied in a tank designed by the Canadian General Staff, also influenced the development of the American Sherman tank. Before long American military agencies and designers had accumulated sufficient experience to forge ahead on several points. In the field of tank armament the American 75&nbsp;mm and 76&nbsp;mm dual-purpose tank guns won the acknowledgement of British tank experts.<ref>''British War Production'' by Michael Postan (1952) p. 245</ref> Detailed design characteristics for the M4 were submitted by the Ordnance Department on 31 August 1940, but development of a prototype was delayed while the final production designs of the M3 were finished and the M3 entered full-scale production. On 18 April 1941, the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the M3's 75&nbsp;mm gun. This would later become the Sherman.<ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/>\n\nThe Sherman's reliability resulted from many features developed for U.S. light tanks during the 1930s, including [[vertical volute spring suspension]], rubber-bushed tracks, and a rear-mounted [[radial engine]] with drive sprockets in front. The goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank then in use by the [[Axis powers|Axis nations]].\n\nThe T6 prototype was completed on 2 September 1941. The upper hull of the T6 was a single large casting. It featured a single overhead hatch for the driver, and a hatch in the side of the hull. In the later M4A1 production model, this large casting was maintained, although the side hatch was eliminated and a second overhead hatch was added for the assistant driver. The modified T6 was standardized as the M4, and production began in February 1942.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20050729b |title=Opening Salvo: M4A1 Sherman Tank |first=Michael J. |last=Canavan |publisher=[[Avalon Hill]] / Wizards.com}}</ref> The cast-hull models would later be re-standardized as M4A1, with the first welded-hull models receiving the designation M4. In August, 1942, a variant of the M4 was put forth by the Detroit Arsenal to have angled, rather than rounded hull and turret armor. The changes were intended to improve the tank's protection without increasing weight or degrading other technical characteristics.\n\n===Doctrine===\n[[File:Sherman tank and Horsa glider.jpg|thumb|A Sherman [[DD tank|DD]] amphibious tank of 13th/18th Royal Hussars in action against German troops using crashed [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa]] gliders as cover near Ranville, [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]], 10 June 1944]]\n\nAs the United States approached entry into World War II, armored employment was doctrinally governed by [[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual&nbsp;100\u20135, Operations]] (published May 1941, the month following selection of the M4 tank's final design). That field manual stated:\n{{quote|The armored division is organized primarily to perform missions that require great mobility and firepower. It is given decisive missions. It is capable of engaging in all forms of combat, but its primary role is in offensive operations against hostile rear areas.<ref>{{cite book |author=War Department |authorlink=United States Department of War |title=FM&nbsp;100\u20135, Field Service Regulations, Operations |date=22 May 1941 |place=Washington, DC |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|GPO]] |type=reprint |oclc=49969146 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/FM100-5/index.html |accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe M4 was, therefore, not originally intended primarily as an [[Infantry tank|infantry support tank]]. It placed tanks in the \"striking echelon\" of the armored division, and placed the infantry in the \"support echelon\", without directing that tanks should only seek to attack other tanks, thus leaving target selection up to the field commander based on what types of units were available to him to attack. A field manual covering the use of the Sherman (FM 17\u201333, \"The Tank Battalion, Light and Medium\" of September 1942) described fighting enemy tanks when necessary as one of the many roles of the Sherman, but devoted only one page of text and four diagrams to tank-versus-tank action, out of 142 pages.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM17-33.PDF |title=FM 17\u201333}}</ref> This early armored doctrine was heavily influenced by the sweeping early war successes of German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics. By the time M4s reached combat in significant numbers, battlefield demands for infantry support and tank versus tank action far outnumbered the occasional opportunities of rear-echelon exploitation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nUnited States doctrine held that the most critical anti-tank work (stopping massed enemy tank attacks) was primarily to be done by towed and self-propelled anti-tank guns, both of which were referred to as \"tank destroyers\", with friendly tanks being used in support if possible.<ref>FM 100-5, Paragraph 680 and 685, 1941</ref> Speed was essential in order to bring the tank destroyers from the rear to destroy incoming tanks. This doctrine was rarely followed in combat, as it was found to be impractical. Commanders were reluctant to leave tank destroyers in reserve; if they were, it was also easier for an opposing armored force to achieve a breakthrough against an American tank battalion, which would not have all of its anti-tank weapons at the front during the beginning of any attack.<ref>''Tank Tactics: From Normandy to Lorraine'' by Roman Jarymowycz, Ch. 5 \"Creating North American Panzer Armies\"</ref>\n\n==U.S. production history==\n{{See also|American armored fighting vehicle production during World War II}}\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Bovington Tank Museum 276 SHERMAN 2.jpg|thumb|right|The second production Sherman, ''Michael'', displayed at [[The Tank Museum]], [[Bovington]], England (2010)]]\n[[File:Sherman Dresden 2.jpg|right|thumb|M4 and M4A1 (shown), the first Shermans, share the inverted U backplate and inherited their engine and exhaust system from the earlier M3 Medium Tank]]\n[[File:M4 Sherman tank at the Imperial War Museum.jpg|thumb|This M4A4 has extra armor plates in front of crew hatches]]\nThe first production of the Sherman took place at the [[Lima Locomotive Works]], producing them for British use.

A third of all Army tank battalions, and all six Marine tank battalions, were deployed to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] (PTO).<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 24, 301</ref> Prior to September 1942, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had announced a production program calling for 120,000 tanks for the Allied war effort. Although the American industrial complex was not affected by enemy [[Strategic bombing during World War II|aerial bombing]] nor [[submarine warfare]] as was [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Germany during World War II|Germany]] and, to a lesser degree, [[Great Britain]], an enormous amount of [[steel]] for tank production had been diverted to the construction of warships and other naval vessels.<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) pp. 22, 24, 28</ref> Steel used in naval construction amounted to the equivalent of approximately 67,000 tanks; and consequently only about 53,500 tanks were produced during 1942 and 1943.<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 24</ref>\n\nThe Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during production: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations did not necessarily indicate linear improvement; in that \"M4A4\" did not indicate it was better than \"M4A3\". These sub-types indicated standardized production variations, which were in fact often manufactured concurrently at different locations. The sub-types differed mainly in engines, although the M4A1 differed from the other variants by its fully cast upper hull, with a distinctive rounded appearance. The M4A4 had a longer engine system that required a longer hull and more track blocks, and thus the most distinguishing feature of the M4A4 was the wider longitudinal spacing between the bogies. \"M4A5\" was an administrative placeholder designation for [[Grizzly I cruiser|Canadian production]]. The M4A6 had a radial diesel engine as well as the elongated chassis of the M4A4, but only 75 of these were ever produced.\n\nMost Sherman sub-types ran on gasoline.

The M4A3 used the liquid-cooled {{cvt|450|hp|kW}} [[Ford GAA engine|Ford GAA]] V8 gasoline engine, and the M4A4 used the liquid cooled {{cvt|370|hp|kW}} 30 cylinder [[Chrysler A57 multibank|Chrysler A57]] multibank gasoline engine. There were also two diesel engined variants. The M4A2 was powered by a pair of liquid cooled [[General Motors|GMC]] [[Detroit Diesel Series 71|6\u201371]] [[two-stroke]] inline engines,<ref>Berndt, Thomas. ''Standard Catalog of U.S. Military Vehicles'' (Krause Publications, 1993), pp. 192\u201393.</ref> that produced a total of {{cvt|375|hp|kW}}, while the M4A6 used an RD-1820 (a redesigned [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] D-200A air cooled [[Radial engine#Diesel radials|radial]] diesel engine, adapted from [[Wright Aeronautical]]'s [[Wright R-1820|''Cyclone 9'']] nine cylinder radial aircraft engine.<ref>Berndt, pp. 192\u201393.</ref>) that produced {{cvt|450|hp|kW}}. The M4A2 and M4A4 were mostly supplied to other Allied countries under [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>Berndt, pp. 190, 192\u201393.</ref> The term \"M4\" can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved while in production, without a change to the tank's basic model number. These included more durable suspension units, safer \"wet\" (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger or more effective armor arrangements, such as the M4 \"Composite\", which had a cheaper to produce cast front hull section mated to a regular welded rear hull. British nomenclature regarding Sherman variants differed from that employed by the U.S. A 24-volt electrical system was used in the M4.<ref name=\"Berndt, p.195\">Berndt, p. 195</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid #999; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; margin: 1en 1en 1en 0;\"\n|-\n|+ M4 Sherman: comparison of key production features of selected models\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Designation\n!

Although Ordnance began work on the [[T20 medium tank]] series as Sherman replacements, ultimately the Army decided to minimize production disruption by incorporating elements of other tank designs into the Sherman. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger T23 turret with a high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1|76 mm gun]]. Later, the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer and a distinctive rounded [[mantlet]], which surrounded the main gun, on the turret. The first standard-production 76&nbsp;mm gun-armed Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, which first saw combat in July 1944 during [[Operation Cobra]]. The first Sherman to be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm howitzer was the M4, first accepted in February 1944.\n\nFrom May to July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 ''Jumbo'' Shermans, which had very thick hull armor and the 75&nbsp;mm gun in a new, far better protected T23-style turret, in order to assault fortifications. The M4A3 model was the first to be factory-produced with the horizontal volute spring suspension (HVSS) system, beginning in August 1944. With wider tracks to distribute weight, and the smooth ride of the HVSS, it gained the nickname \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet#Prior Alphabets|Easy Eight]]\" from its experimental E8 designation. The M4 and M4A3 105&nbsp;mm-armed tanks, as well as the M4A1 and M4A2 76&nbsp;mm-armed tanks, were also eventually equipped with HVSS. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman, although few saw combat, remaining experimental. Those that saw action included a bulldozer blade, the [[Duplex Drive]] system, flamethrowers for ''Zippo'' [[flame tank]]s, and various rocket launchers such as the [[T34 Calliope]]. British variants (DDs and [[mine flail]]s) formed part of the group of specialized vehicles collectively known as \"[[Hobart's Funnies]]\" (after [[Percy Hobart]], commander of the [[79th Armoured Division]]).\n\nThe M4 Sherman's basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force: roughly 49,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers. These included the [[M10 tank destroyer|M10]] and [[M36 tank destroyer|M36]] tank destroyers; [[M7 Priest|M7B1]], [[M12 Gun Motor Carriage|M12]], [[M40 GMC|M40]], and [[M43 Gun Motor Carriage|M43]] self-propelled artillery; the M32 and M74 \"tow truck\"-style [[armored recovery vehicle|recovery tanks]] with winches, booms, and an 81&nbsp;mm mortar for smoke screens; and the M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) [[artillery tractor|artillery prime movers]].\n\n{{wide image|M4A4 cutaway.svg|550px|M4A4 Cutaway: '''1''' \u2013 Lifting ring, '''2''' \u2013 Ventilator, '''3''' \u2013 Turret hatch, '''4''' \u2013 Periscope, '''5''' \u2013 Turret hatch race, '''6''' \u2013 Turret seat, '''7''' \u2013 Gunner's seat, '''8''' \u2013 Turret seat, '''9''' \u2013 Turret, '''10''' \u2013 Air cleaner, '''11''' \u2013 Radiator filler cover, '''12''' \u2013 Air cleaner manifold, '''13''' \u2013 Power unit, '''14''' \u2013 Exhaust pipe, '''15''' \u2013 Track idler, '''16''' \u2013 Single water pump, '''17''' \u2013 Radiator, '''18''' \u2013 Generator, '''19''' \u2013 Rear propeller shaft, '''20''' \u2013 Turret basket, '''21''' \u2013 Slip ring, '''22''' \u2013 Front propeller shaft, '''23''' \u2013 Suspension bogie, '''24''' \u2013 Transmission, '''25''' \u2013 Main drive sprocket, '''26''' \u2013 Driver's seat, '''27''' \u2013 Machine gunner's seat, '''28''' \u2013 75 mm gun, '''29''' \u2013 Drivers hatch, '''30''' \u2013 M1919A4 machine gun.}}\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n|+ M4 Sherman Production<ref name=\"World War II vehicles\">{{cite web |first1=Cary |last1=Siemers |url=http://www.wwiivehicles.com/united-states/vehicle/medium-tank/m4-medium-tank-production.asp |title=United States' M4 medium tank production, Sherman |accessdate=7 April 2015 |website=wwiivehicles.com |year=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404211640/http://www.wwiivehicles.com/united-states/vehicle/medium-tank/m4-medium-tank-production.asp |archive-date=4 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/><ref>http://the.shadock.free.fr/sherman_minutia/data/sherman_production.html}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n|-valign=top\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Designation\n!

However, the Chief of the Army's Armored Force, Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], ordered that no diesel-engined Shermans be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States, but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 (with the A57 Multibank engine) to be the primary Lend-Lease exports.\n\n===First combat===\nShermans were being issued in small numbers for familiarization to U.S. armored divisions when there was a turn of events in the [[North Africa Campaign|Western Desert campaign]]. Axis forces [[Battle of Gazala|had taken Tobruk]] and were advancing into Egypt and Britain's supply line through the [[Suez Canal]] was threatened. The US considered collecting all Shermans together so as to be able to send the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] under [[George S. Patton|Patton]] to reinforce Egypt, but delivering the Shermans directly to the British was quicker and over 300 \u2013 mostly M4A1s, but also including M4A2s \u2013 had arrived there by September 1942.<ref name=\"Fletcher p93\"/><ref>Hunnicutt p174</ref>\n\nThe Shermans were modified for desert warfare with sandshields over the tracks and other stowage. The Sherman first saw combat at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in October 1942 with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]]. At the start of the offensive, there were 252 tanks fit for action. These equipped the [[9th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|British 9th Armoured Brigade]] (with the [[2nd New Zealand Division|New Zealand Division]]), 2nd Armoured Brigade (1st Armoured Division) and 8th and 20th Armoured Brigades (10th Armoured Division). Their first encounter with tanks was against German Panzer III and IV tanks with long 50&nbsp;mm and 75&nbsp;mm guns engaging them at {{convert|2000|yards|m}}. There were losses to both sides.<ref>Hunnicutt pp. 175\u201476</ref>\n\nThe first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4s and M4A1s in [[Operation Torch]] the following month. On 6 December, near [[Tebourba|Tebourba, Tunisia]], a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment was lost to enemy tanks and anti-tank guns.<ref>Hunnicutt p. 178</ref>\n\nAdditional M4s and M4A1s replaced M3s in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaign.\n\nThe M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until late 1944, when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful {{cvt|500|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war. The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76&nbsp;mm gun in July 1944 was the M4A1, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, roughly half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76&nbsp;mm gun. The first HVSS-equipped Sherman to see combat was the M4A3(76)W in December 1944.\n\n===Eastern Front===\nThe M4A2s used by the Red Army were considered to be much-less prone to blow up due to ammunition detonation than their [[T-34|T-34/76]] but had a higher tendency to overturn in road accidents and collisions or because of rough terrain due to their much-higher center of gravity.<ref>[http://www.iremember.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=19 \u041b\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u2013 \u042f \u041f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044e. \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b. \u0423\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0412\u041e\u0412.] in Russian.</ref>\n\nUnder Lend-Lease, 4,102 M4A2 medium tanks were sent to the Soviet Union.

Although the high-velocity guns of tank destroyers were useful for penetrating fortifications, M4s armed with flamethrowers were often deployed, as direct fire seldom destroyed Japanese fortifications.<ref>Zaloga, ''Armored Thunderbolt'', \"Bunker Blasters\" p. 215\u201317, 318 caption.</ref><ref>Zaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 35, \"tank guns could not penetrate bunkers\"</ref>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\n[[File:Sherman-korea.jpg|thumb|Last type in US service: M4A3(76)W HVSS Sherman used as artillery in firing position during the [[Korean War]]]]\n\nAfter World War II, the U.S. kept the M4A3E8 '\"Easy Eight\" in service, with either the 76&nbsp;mm gun or a 105&nbsp;mm M4 howitzer.

The 75&nbsp;mm-armed Shermans were replaced by M4A1 (76&nbsp;mm) Shermans imported from France before the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], after it was realised that their armor penetration was insufficient for combat against newer tanks such as the IDF Centurions as well as the T-34-85s being delivered to Egyptian forces.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lion and Lioness of the Line Volume 12|last=Manasherob|first=Robert|publisher=SabIngaMartin Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9841437-8-8|location=|pages=1\u20132|via=}}</ref> During further upgrades, the French military helped develop a conversion kit to upgrade about 300 Shermans to the long high-velocity 75&nbsp;mm gun CN 75-50 used in the [[AMX-13]].

Developed from a land-based anti-aircraft gun, its size and weight made it too large to fit in the turret of the Sherman. Development on a new 76&nbsp;mm gun better-suited to the Sherman began in 1942.\n\nIn early 1942, tests began on the feasibility of mounting a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer into the turret of the Sherman. The basic [[M101 howitzer|105&nbsp;mm howitzer M2A1]] was found to be ill-designed for mounting in a tank turret, so it was completely redesigned and re-designated the 105&nbsp;mm howitzer M4. After modifications to the turret (concerning the balancing of the gun and the strength of the power traverse) and interior of the hull (concerning the stowage of the 105&nbsp;mm ammunition), the Ordnance Department expressed its approval of the project, and production of M4 tanks armed with 105&nbsp;mm howitzers began in February 1944.<ref>Hunnicutt pp. 208-210</ref>\n\nThe Sherman would enter combat in 1942 equipped with the [[75 mm Gun (US)#M3 2|75&nbsp;mm gun M3]], a 40-[[Caliber (artillery)#Barrel length|caliber]] gun that could penetrate {{convert|88|mm|in|abbr=on}} of unsloped [[rolled homogeneous armor]] (RHA) at {{convert|100|meters|yards}} and {{convert|73|mm|in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1000|meters|yards}} firing the usual M61 round.<ref name=\"M4A3\">{{cite book|last1=Bird |first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D.|title=WWII Ballistics: Armor and Gunnery|date=2001|publisher=Overmatch Press|pages=62\u201363}}</ref> Facing the early [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] in North Africa, the Sherman's gun could penetrate the frontal armor of these tanks at normal combat ranges, within {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. U.S. Army Intelligence discounted the arrival of the [[Tiger I]] in 1942 and the [[Panther tank]] in 1943, predicting that the Panther would be a heavy tank like the Tiger I, and doubted that many would be produced. There were also reports of British [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6 pdr]] (57&nbsp;mm) guns being able to destroy the Tiger I. However, this only happened at very close ranges and against the thinner side armor. Due to their misconceptions related to this, and also due to tests that seemed to prove that the 76&nbsp;mm gun was able to destroy both the Tiger and the Panther, the leadership of Army Ground Forces were not especially concerned by the Tiger I. The tests of the 76&nbsp;mm were later ruled inaccurate, with Eisenhower even remarking that he was wrongly told by Ordnance that the 76&nbsp;mm could knock out any German tank. The Army also failed to anticipate that the Germans would attempt to make the Panther the standard tank of their panzer divisions in 1944, supported by small numbers of Tiger I and IIs.<ref>Zaloga 2008, p. 94-97</ref>\n\nWhen the newly designed 76&nbsp;mm gun, known as the T1, was first installed in the M4 in 1943, it was found to unbalance the turret, and the gun barrel also protruded too far forward, making it more difficult to transport and susceptible to hitting the ground when the tank traveled over undulating terrain. The barrel length was reduced by {{convert|15|inch|mm|abbr=on}} (from 57 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] to 52), resulting in the M1 variant. Mounting this gun in the original M4 turret proved problematic, so the turret for the aborted T23 tank project was used instead for the definitive production version of the 76&nbsp;mm M4 Shermans,<ref>Zaloga pp. 106\u201308, 115\u201316</ref> along with a modified version of the gun known as the M1A1.\n\nDespite the Ordnance Department's development of new 76&nbsp;mm and 90&nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, the Army Ground Forces rejected their deployment as unnecessary. An attempt to upgrade the M4 Sherman by installing the 90&nbsp;mm-armed turret from the T26 tank project on an M4 hull in April 1944 was halted after realizing it could not go into production sooner than the T26 and would likely delay T26 development.<ref>Zaloga 2008, pp. 126\u201330</ref> Even in 1943, most German armored fighting vehicles (later models of the Panzer IV, [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]], and [[Marder III]]) mounted the [[7.5 cm KwK 40]]. As a result, even weakly armored light German tank destroyers such as the Marder III, which was meant to be a stop-gap measure to fight Soviet tanks in 1942, could destroy Shermans from a distance. The disparity in firepower between the German armored fighting vehicles of 1943 and the 75&nbsp;mm-armed M4 was the impetus to begin production of 76&nbsp;mm-armed M4s in January 1944.<ref>Zaloga pp. 115\u201316</ref> In testing prior to the [[invasion of Normandy]], the 76&nbsp;mm gun was found to have an undesirably large muzzle blast that kicked up dust from the ground and obscured vision for further firing. The M1A1C gun, which entered production lines in March 1944, was threaded for a muzzle brake, but as the brakes were still in development, the threads were protected with a cap. The addition of a [[muzzle brake]] on the new M1A2 gun (which also incorporated a faster rifling twist leading to a slight accuracy increase at longer ranges) beginning in October 1944 finally solved this problem by directing the blast sideways.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=M4 (76mm) Sherman Tank 1943\u201365|date=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing, Ltd|isbn=1841765422|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nArmy doctrine at the time emphasized the multirole ability of the tank, and the capability of the high explosive shell was considered important. Being a dedicated anti-tank gun, the 76&nbsp;mm had a much weaker high explosive shell than the existing 75&nbsp;mm, and was not initially accepted by various U.S. armored division commanders, even though many had already been produced and were available. All of the U.S. Army M4s deployed initially in Normandy in June 1944 had the 75&nbsp;mm gun.<ref>Zaloga 129\u2013131</ref> Tests against American armor plate suggested that the new M1A1 gun would be adequate, but testing against captured Panther tanks was never done. Fighting against Panther tanks in Normandy quickly demonstrated the need for better anti-tank firepower, and the 76&nbsp;mm M4s were deployed to [[First United States Army|First Army]] units in July 1944.

General Devers insisted on comparison tests between the 17-pounder and the U.S. 90&nbsp;mm gun. The tests were finally done on March 25 and May 23, 1944; they seemed to show the 90&nbsp;mm gun was equal to or better than the 17-pounder. By then, production of the 76&nbsp;mm-armed M4 and the 90&nbsp;mm-armed M36 were both underway and U.S. Army interest in the 17-pounder waned. Late in 1944, the British began to produce tungsten [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|sabot]] rounds for the 17-pounder, which could readily breach the armor of even the [[Tiger II]]; these were not as accurate as standard rounds and not generally available.\n\nAfter the heavy tank losses of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], in January 1945, General Eisenhower asked that no more 75&nbsp;mm M4s be sent to Europe: only 76&nbsp;mm M4s were wanted.<ref>Zaloga 2008, pp. 268\u201369</ref>\n\nInterest in mounting the British 17-pounder in U.S. Shermans flared anew. In February 1945, the U.S. Army began sending 75&nbsp;mm M4s to England for conversion to the 17-pounder. Approximately 100 conversions were completed by the beginning of May. By then, the end of the war in Europe was clearly in sight, and the U.S. Army decided the logistical difficulties of adding a new ammunition caliber to the supply train was not warranted. None of the converted 17-pounder M4s were deployed in combat by the U.S., and it is unclear what happened to most of them, although some were given to the British as part of Lend-Lease post-war.<ref>Zaloga 2008, pp. 276\u201377</ref>\n\n===The tank destroyer doctrine===\n\nGeneral [[Lesley J. McNair]] was head of the Army Ground Forces from 1942 to 1944. McNair, a former artilleryman, advocated for the role of the [[tank destroyer]] (TD) within the U.S. Army. In McNair's opinion, tanks were to exploit breakthroughs and support infantry, while masses of attacking hostile tanks were to be engaged by tank destroyer units, which were composed of a mix of self-propelled and towed anti-tank guns. Armored Force and Tank Destroyer Force doctrine were developed separately, and it was not against Armored Force doctrine for friendly tanks to engage hostile tanks while attacking or defending.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moran|first1=Nicholas|title=Myths of American Armor|url=http://worldoftanks.com/en/news/pc-browser/21/The_Chieftains_Hatch_American_Myths/|website=World of Tanks|publisher=Wargaming.net|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> The tank destroyers were to engage numbers of enemy tanks that broke through friendly lines. U.S. tank destroyers, called \"gun motor carriages\" (as were any U.S. Army self-propelled armored vehicles mounting an artillery piece of heavy caliber) were similar to tanks but were lightly armored with open-topped turrets. The tank destroyers were supposed to be faster and carry a more powerful anti-tank gun than tanks (although in reality tanks often received more powerful guns before tank destroyers did) and armor was sacrificed for speed.<ref>Zaloga 2008, \"McNair's Folly\" pp. 72\u201377</ref>\n\nMcNair approved the 76&nbsp;mm upgrade to the M4 Sherman and production of the 90&nbsp;mm gun-armed [[M36 tank destroyer]], but he at first staunchly opposed mass production of the [[T20 medium tank]] series and its descendants, the T25 and T26 (which would eventually become the [[M26 Pershing]]) during the crucial period of 1943 because they were not \"battle worthy\" and he saw no \"battle need\" for them. In fall 1943, Lieutenant General Devers, commander of U.S. forces in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO), asked for 250 T26 tanks for use in the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of France]]; McNair refused, citing the fact that he believed the M4 was adequate. Devers appealed all the way to the War Department, and Major General [[Russell L. Maxwell]], the Assistant Chief of Staff G-4 of the War Department General Staff, ordered the 250 tanks built in December 1943. McNair finally relented in his opposition, but still opposed mass production; his Army Ground Forces even asked for the tanks to be \"down-gunned\" from 90&nbsp;mm to 75 or 76&nbsp;mm in April 1944, believing the 76&nbsp;mm gun was capable of performing satisfactorily. Marshall then summarily ordered the tanks to be provided to the ETO as soon as possible. Soon after the [[Normandy invasion]] in June 1944, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] urgently requested heavy tanks, but McNair's continued opposition to mass production due to persistent serious mechanical problems with the vehicles delayed their procurement. That same month, the War Department reversed course and completely overruled the Army Ground Forces when making their tank production plan for 1945. 7,800 tanks were to be built, of which 2,060 were to be T26s armed with 90&nbsp;mm guns, 2,728 were to be T26s armed with 105&nbsp;mm howitzers, and 3,000 were to be M4A3 Sherman tanks armed with 105&nbsp;mm howitzers. As a part of the plan, the British requested 750 90&nbsp;mm-armed T26s and 200 105&nbsp;mm-armed T26s.<ref>Zaloga, Stephen. T-34-85 vs M26 Pershing: Korea 1950.

However, only a few T26 tanks (by then designated M26) saw combat beginning in February 1945, too late to have any effect on the battlefield.<ref>Zaloga 2008, pp. 120\u201325, 287</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n[[File:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] M4A3 uses its flame thrower during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]]]\n\nThe Sherman, like its M3 predecessor, was one of the first tanks to feature a gyroscopically stabilized gun and sight. The stabilization was only in the vertical plane, as the mechanism could not slew the turret. The stabilizer was sufficient to keep the gun's elevation setting within 1/8th of a degree, or 2 mils while crossing moderately rough terrain at {{convert|15|mph|km/h}}. This gave a hit probability of 70% on enemy tanks at ranges of {{convert|300|yards|meters}} to {{convert|1200|yards|meters}}.<ref>\"Ohio State Engineer\", vol 28 number 4 (March 1945) pp. 10\u201311, 23.</ref> The utility of the stabilization is debatable, with some saying it was useful for its intended purpose, others only for using the sights for stabilized viewing on the move.<ref>\"M4 Sherman at War\" by Michael Green, James D.

In the close fighting of the French ''[[bocage]]'', the U.S. Army's [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] tanks used [[Rhino tank|Culin Hedgerow Cutters]] fitted to their tanks to push three tanks together through a hedgerow. The flank tanks would clear the back of the hedgerow on their side with canister rounds while the center tank would engage and suppress known or suspected enemy positions on the next hedgerow. This approach permitted surprisingly fast progress through the very tough and well-defended hedgerows in Normandy. Over 500 sets of these were fitted to US armored vehicles, and many fitted to various British tanks (where they were called \"Prongs\").\n\nThe 75&nbsp;mm gun had a [[white phosphorus]] shell originally intended for use as an artillery marker to help with targeting. M4 tank crews discovered that the shell could also be used against the Tiger and Panther\u2014when the burning white phosphorus adhered to the German tanks, their excellent optics would be blinded and the acrid smoke would get sucked inside the vehicle, making it difficult or impossible for the crew to breathe. This, and the fear of fire starting or spreading inside the tank, would sometimes cause the crew to abandon the tank.<ref>Zaloga 2008 p. 182</ref> There were several recorded instances where white phosphorus shells defeated German tanks in this fashion.<ref>Schneider 2004, p. 303</ref>\n\nA variant of the M4 Sherman was armed with the [[M101 howitzer|105&nbsp;mm M4 howitzer]], which provided even more powerful high explosive armament.

According to Dr Leo Niehorster's website, the Armd Inf was still using the M8 HMC following the Jan 1944 change; he also says that the Tk Btns didn't get 105s until 2 Jul 1944--> The 105&nbsp;mm-armed variants were of limited use against enemy tanks due to the poor anti-armor performance of the howitzer, which was not intended to fight other tanks, though a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round for the 105&nbsp;mm howitzer was available for self-defense.\n\n==Armor==\n[[File:M4A4-Sherman-latrun-6.jpg|thumb|This early 75&nbsp;mm gun turret shows the single hatch; the additional rectangular external (welded on) ''appliqu\u00e9'' armor patch reinforces the ammunition bin protection on the hull side]]\n\n===Turret===\nThe turret armor of the 75&nbsp;mm and 105&nbsp;mm-armed M4 ranged from {{convert|25.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|76.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=\"Zaloga14\">Zaloga (1993), p. 14</ref> The turret front armor was 76.2&nbsp;mm thick, angled at 30 degrees from the vertical, giving an effective thickness of {{convert|87.9|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The opening in the front of the M4's turret for the main gun was covered by a rounded {{convert|50.8|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick rotor shield. Early Shermans that had a periscopic sight for the main gun mounted in the turret roof possessed a small {{convert|76.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick mantlet that only covered the hole where the main gun barrel protruded; the exposed barrel of the coaxial machine gun was vulnerable to bullet splash or shrapnel and a small armored cover was manufactured to protect it. When the Sherman was later fitted with a telescopic sight next to the main gun, a larger {{convert|76.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick gun mantlet that covered the entire rotor shield including the sight and coaxial machine gun barrel was produced.<ref name=\"Zaloga14\"/><ref name=\"Reid215\">Reid, p. 215</ref> 105&nbsp;mm-armed Sherman tanks did not have a rotor shield, possessing only the mantlet to cover the opening in the turret front.

This turret's armor was {{convert|63.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick on the sides and rear, angled from 0 to 13 degrees from the vertical. It had a {{convert|25.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roof, which sat at 0 to 45 degrees from the vertical.<ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/> The front of the T23 turret, which like the 105&nbsp;mm-armed Sherman's turret, did not have a rotor shield, was protected by an unsloped {{convert|88.9|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick cast gun mantlet. Combat experience indicated that the single hatch in the three-man 75&nbsp;mm gun turret was inadequate for timely evacuation, so Ordnance added a loader's hatch beside the commander's beginning in late 1943. All 76&nbsp;mm gun turrets had two roof hatches.\n\n===Hull===\n[[File:Yanks of 60th Infantry Regiment advance into a Belgian town under the protection of a heavy tank. - NARA - 531213.tif|left|thumb|The 1943 improvement program added patches of appliqu\u00e9 armor to the sides of the turret and hull. This Sherman also sports a [[Rhino tank|Culin hedgerow cutter]], a 1944 field improvisation for breaking through the thick hedgerows of the Normandy [[bocage]]]]\nThe Sherman's [[glacis]] plate was originally {{convert|50.8|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=\"Zaloga14\"/><ref name=\"Hart27\"/> and angled at 56 degrees from the vertical, providing an effective thickness of {{convert|90.8|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The M4, M4A1, early production M4A2 and early production M4A3 possessed protruding cast \"hatchway\" structures that allowed the driver and assistant driver's hatches to fit in front of the turret ring. In these areas, the effect of the glacis plate's slope was greatly reduced. Later Shermans had an upgraded glacis plate that was uniformly {{convert|63.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick and sloped at 47 degrees from the vertical, providing an effective thickness of {{convert|93.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} over the entire plate. The new design improved overall ballistic protection by eliminating the \"hatchways\", while also allowing for larger hatches for the driver and bow gunner. The cast hull M4A1 for the most part retained its previous glacis shape even after the larger hatches were introduced; the casting, irrespective of the larger hatches, sat 37 to 55 degrees from the vertical, with the large majority of the piece sitting closer to a 55 degree angle.<ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/>\n\nThe transmission housing was rounded, made of three cast sections bolted together or cast as one piece. It ranged from {{convert|50.8|\u2013|108|mm|in|frac=4}} thick<ref name=\"Hart27\"/> The upper and lower hull sides were {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick,<ref name=\"Reid215\"/><ref name=\"Buckley110\">Buckley, p. 110</ref> and vertical,<ref name=\"Hart27\"/> while the upper hull rear was also {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, vertical or sloped at 10 degrees from the vertical. The lower hull rear, which protected the engine, was {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, sloped at 0 to 22 degrees from the vertical depending upon the variant.<ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/> The hull roof was {{convert|25.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Hart27\"/> The hull floor ranged from {{convert|25.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick under the driver and assistant driver's positions to {{convert|12.7|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick at the rear. The M4 had a hatch on the hull bottom to dispose of spent shell casings and to provide an emergency escape route. In the Pacific, Marines often used this Sherman feature in reverse to recover wounded infantry under fire.\n\n===Effectiveness===\nThe armor of the M4 was effective against most early war tank and anti-tank weapons,<ref name=\"Zaloga14\"/> but needed a compound angle to resist later German tank and anti-tank guns. The distinctive protruding \"hatchways\" of the early Sherman compromised the 56 degree-angled glacis plate, making them weak points where the effect of the glacis plate's slope was greatly reduced. In 1943, to make the thickness of these areas equal with the rest of the glacis plate, {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|thick}} appliqu\u00e9 armor plates were fitted in front of them.\n\nA [[Waffenamt|Waffenamt-Pr\u00fcfwesen 1]] report estimated<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Tiger 1 Heavy Tank 1942-45|date=1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1855323370|page=20}}</ref> that with the M4 angled 30 degrees sidewards, the Sherman's glacis plate was invulnerable to shots from the Tiger's 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 36 L/56<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Tiger I Heavy Tank 1942\u201345|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=19}}</ref> and that the Panther, with its 7.5&nbsp;cm KwK 42 L/70, would have to close in to {{convert|100|meters|yards}} to achieve a penetration in the same situation.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995:128\">Jentz 1995:128</ref> Although the later-model German medium and heavy tanks were greatly feared, Buckley opined \"The vast majority of German tanks encountered in Normandy were either inferior or merely equal to the Sherman.\"<ref>Buckley, p. 117</ref>\n\nResearch for tank casualties in Normandy from 6 June to 10 July 1944 conducted by the British No. 2 [[Operations research|Operational Research]] concluded that, from a sample of 40 Sherman tanks, 33 tanks burned (82 percent) and 7 tanks remained unburned following an average of 1.89 penetrations. In comparison, from a sample of 5 Panzer IV's, 4 tanks burned (80 percent) and 1 tank remained unburned, following an average of 1.5 penetrations. The Panther tank burned 14 times (63 percent) from a sample of 22 tanks and following 3.24 penetrations, while the Tiger burned 4 times (80 percent) out of a sample of 5 tanks following 3.25 penetrations.<ref>Copp, pp. 399\u2013406</ref> John Buckley, using a case study of the British [[8th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th]] and [[29th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th Armoured Brigades]], found that of their 166 Shermans knocked out in combat during the Normandy campaign, 94 (56.6 percent) burned out. Buckley also notes that an American survey carried out concluded that 65% of tanks burned out after being penetrated.<ref name=\"Buckley127\">Buckley, p. 127</ref> United States Army research proved that the major reason for this was the stowage of main gun ammunition in the vulnerable sponsons above the tracks. A U.S. Army study in 1945 concluded that only 10\u201315 percent of wet stowage Shermans burned when penetrated, compared to 60\u201380 percent of the older dry-stowage Shermans.<ref name=\"Zaloga 2008, p. 116-118\">Zaloga (2008), pp. 116\u201318</ref>\n\nAt first, a partial remedy to ammunition fires in the M4 was found in 1943 by welding {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|thick}} appliqu\u00e9 armor plates to the sponson sides over the ammunition stowage bins, though there was doubt that these had any effect. Later models moved ammunition stowage to the hull floor, with water jackets surrounding each stowage bin. The practice, known as wet stowage, reduced the chance of fire after a hit to about 15 percent.<ref>Buckley p. 128</ref> The Sherman gained grim nicknames like \"Zippo\" (after the cigarette lighter), \"[[Ronson (company)|Ronson]]\" (because \"it lights the first time, every time\").<ref name=\"Hell\">{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/armored-coffin-m-4-sherman-120000452.html |title=Armored Coffin: The M-4 Sherman Tank Was Hell on Wheels |work=[[The National Interest]] |author=[[David Axe|Axe, David]] [[David Axe#War is Boring|War Is Boring]] |date=April 30, 2019 |accessdate=May 1, 2019}}</ref>(this story has been challenged on the grounds that Ronson did not begin using that slogan until the 1950s). <ref>https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/chieftain/The_Chieftains_Hatch_American_Myths/ |title=The Chieftan's Hatch: Myths of American Armor |access-date=2020-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227055529/https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/chieftain/The_Chieftains_Hatch_American_Myths/ |archive-date=2020-02-27 |url-status=dead }} ''World of Tanks''.

Fuel fires occasionally occurred, but such fires were far less common and less deadly than ammunition fires.<ref name=\"Zaloga 2008, p. 116-118\"/> In many cases, the fuel tank of the Sherman was found intact after a fire. Tankers described \"fierce, blinding jets of flame\", which is inconsistent with gasoline-related fires.<ref name=\"Buckley127\"/>\n\n===Upgrades===\nUpgrades included the rectangular armor patches protecting ammunition stowage mentioned above, and smaller armor patches in front of each of the protruding hatchway structures in the glacis in an attempt to mitigate their ballistic weakness. Field improvisations included placing sandbags, spare track links, concrete, wire mesh, or even wood for increased protection against [[shaped-charge]] rounds. While mounting sandbags around a tank had little effect against high-velocity anti-tank gunfire it was thought to provide standoff protection against [[HEAT]] weapons, primarily the German ''Panzerfaust'' anti-tank grenade launcher and the [[bazooka]]-derived ''Panzerschreck'' 88&nbsp;mm calibre anti-tank rocket launcher. In the only study known to have been done to test the use of sandbags, on March 9, 1945, officers of the 1st Armored Group tested standard ''Panzerfaust'' 60s against sandbagged M4s; shots against the side blew away the sandbags and still penetrated the side armor, whereas shots fired at an angle against the front plate blew away some of the sandbags but failed to penetrate the armor. Earlier, in the summer of 1944, General Patton, informed by his ordnance officers that sandbags were useless and that the machines' chassis suffered from the extra weight, had forbidden the use of sandbags. Following the clamor for better armor and firepower after the losses of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], Patton ordered extra armor plates salvaged from knocked-out American and German tanks welded to the turrets and hulls of tanks of his command. Approximately 36 of these up-armored M4s were supplied to each of the three armored divisions of the Third Army in the spring of 1945.<ref>Zaloga (2008), pp. 279\u201384</ref>\n\n====M4A3E2====\n[[File:M4A3E2 Sherman Jumbo 75mm gun.jpg|thumb|M4A3E2 Sherman Jumbo.

Intended for the assault to break out of the Normandy beachhead, it was originally to be armed with the 76&nbsp;mm gun, but the 75&nbsp;mm was preferred for infantry support and was used. The higher weight required reducing maximum speed to 22&nbsp;mph, and crews were warned not to let the suspension \"bottom\" too violently. 254 were built at the Fisher Tank Arsenal from May to July 1944, and arrived in Europe in the fall of 1944, being employed throughout the remainder of the fighting in various roles. They were considered \"highly successful\".<ref>Hunnicutt, pp. 289\u2013290</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mobility==\n[[File:Volutespring.jpg|thumb|[[Vertical volute spring suspension|Vertical volute springs]] of [[Stuart tank]] with similar suspension system]]\n\nIn its initial specifications for a replacement for the M3 Medium Tank, the U.S. Army restricted the Sherman's height, width, and weight so that it could be transported via typical bridges, roads, railroads and landing craft without special accommodation. This greatly aided the strategic, logistical, and tactical flexibility and mobility of all Allied armored forces using the Sherman.\nA long-distance service trial conducted in Britain in 1943 compared diesel and gasoline Shermans to [[Cromwell tank]]s ([[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] engine) and Centaur ([[Liberty L-12]]). The British officer commanding the trial concluded \"They are utterly reliable.....I do not think they are quite as good as the Cromwell across country when they are running on rather worn rubber tracks and the going is greasy, neither does one get as smooth a ride, but they appear so infinitely superior in every other way particularly in reliability with a minimum of maintenance that this cross-country consideration is completely overweighed.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/chieftain/The_Chieftains_Hatch_Dracula/\n | title =Exercise Dracula\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =\n | website =The Chieftain's Hatch\n | publisher =World of Tanks\n | access-date =12 August 2017\n | quote = }}</ref>\n\nThe Sherman had good speed both on- and off-road. Off-road performance varied. In the desert, the Sherman's rubber-block tracks performed well; while in the confined, hilly terrain of Italy, the smaller and more nimble Sherman could often cross terrain that some heavy German tanks could not.\n\n[[Albert Speer]] recounted in his autobiography ''Inside the Third Reich:''\n{{quote|On the southwestern front (Italy) reports on the cross country mobility of the Sherman have been very favorable.

The U.S. Army issued extended end connectors, grousers or \"duckbills\", to add width to the standard tracks as a stopgap solution. Duckbills began to reach front-line tank battalions in July 1944, and were original factory equipment for the heavy M4A3E2 Jumbo to compensate for the extra weight of armor. The M4A3(76)W HVSS Shermans and other late models with wider-tracked HVSS suspension and twin road wheels on each axle \u2013 rather than the single road wheel of the VVSS suspension designs \u2013 corrected these problems but formed only a small proportion of the tanks in service even in 1945.\n\n==U.S. variants==\n{{Main|M4 Sherman variants}}\nVehicles that used the M4 chassis or hull:\n<!--As people write full articles on a particular model, add the new variant articles here.-->\n* [[M10 tank destroyer|3in Gun Motor Carriage M10]] also known as Wolverine \u2013 [[tank destroyer]]\n* [[M36 tank destroyer|90&nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M36]] \u2013 tank destroyer\n* [[M7 Priest|105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M7B1]] also known as Priest \u2013 [[self-propelled artillery]]\n* [[M12 Gun Motor Carriage|155 mm Gun Motor Carriage M12]] \u2013 self-propelled gun, paired in service with the Cargo Carrier M30 (also derived from the Sherman)\n* [[M40 GMC|155/203/250 mm Motor Carriages]] \u2013 155&nbsp;mm self-propelled artillery (armed with the [[155 mm Long Tom|''Long Tom'' artillery piece]]), {{convert|8|in|mm|0|adj=on}} HMC M43, {{convert|250|mm|in|adj=on}} MMC T94, and Cargo Carrier T30\n* [[Sexton (artillery)|Sexton 88mm (25 Pndr) self-propelled gun and variants]]\n* [[Flame tank#M4|Flame Tank Sherman]] \u2013 M4A3R3 ''Zippo'', M4 ''Crocodile'', and other flame-throwing Shermans\n* Rocket Artillery Sherman \u2013 [[T34 Calliope|T34 ''Calliope'']], [[T40 Whizbang|T40 ''Whizbang'']], and other Sherman rocket launchers\n* Amphibious tanks \u2013 [[Duplex Drive]] (DD) swimming Sherman.

Suspension units and roadwheels remained the M3 vertical volute pattern, with the idler ''above'' the mounting bracket, rather than the M4 development with the idler moved behind the mounting bracket to give more room for suspension travel. The Ram had a distinctive turret with a bolted flat-faced mantlet and the UK 6 pdr gun, with the hull machine gunner housed in a rotating turret based on the M3 'Lee' cupola, rather than the simpler ball-mount that was becoming universal for tank hull guns. Production facilities for the Ram were constructed at the [[Montreal Locomotive Works]], with the aid of [[ALCO|Alco]], but the large armor castings for turret and hull were supplied by General Steel Castings in the US. Greater Sherman production and availability meant that the Ram was never used in action as a gun tank, being either used for training or converted to [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers]].<ref name=\"Chamberlain Ellis, Ram\" />\n\nA later Canadian medium tank, produced from late 1943, was the [[Grizzly I cruiser|Grizzly]], an adaption of the Sherman M4A1.

The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce, and available in great numbers. It was also the basis of several successful tank destroyers, such as the [[M10 tank destroyer|M10]], [[17pdr SP Achilles|Achilles]] and [[M36 tank destroyer|M36]]. Tens of thousands were distributed through the [[Lend-Lease]] program to the [[British Empire#Second World War|British Commonwealth]] and [[Soviet Union]]. The tank was named by the British for the American Civil War general [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].\n\nThe M4 Sherman evolved from the [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium Tank]],{{refn|Also known by the British service names \"Grant\" and \"Lee\".|group=N}} which had its main armament in a side [[sponson]] mount. The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design, but moved the main 75&nbsp;mm gun into a fully traversing central turret. One feature, a one-axis [[gyrostabilizer]], was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the reticle on target, so that when the tank did stop to fire, the gun would be aimed in roughly the right direction.<ref>Zaloga, Stephen J. ''Panther vs Sherman: Battle of the Bulge 1944''. Osprey Publishing, 2009, p. 28.</ref> The designers stressed mechanical reliability, ease of production and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight. These factors, combined with the Sherman's then-superior armor and armament, outclassed German [[light tank|light]] and medium tanks fielded in 1939\u201342. The M4 went on to be produced in large numbers, being the most produced tank in American history:<ref name=\"Hell\"/> The Soviets' [[T-34#Mass production|T-34 medium tank]] (total of some 64,549 wartime-produced examples, split roughly 55%-45% between 76&nbsp;mm and 85&nbsp;mm gunned examples) was the only tank design produced in larger numbers<ref name=\"Koshkin\">{{cite book|title=Stalin's Keys to Victory: The Rebirth of the Red Army|year=2007|publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA|isbn=978-0-8117-3423-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JE7Yd2sNBu4C&lpg=PA92&dq=%22T-34%22%20June%201941&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q=%22T-34%22&f=false |author=Walter S. Dunn, Jr}}</ref> during World War II. The Sherman spearheaded many offensives by the Western Allies after 1942.\n\nWhen the M4 tank went into combat in [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]] with the British Army at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] in late 1942, it increased the advantage of Allied armor over Axis armor and was superior to the lighter German<ref>{{cite book|last1=Luck|first1=Hans|title=Panzer Commander: The Memoirs of Colonel Hans von Luck|date=2013|publisher=Dell|page=Paragraph 6.75}}</ref> and Italian tank designs. For this reason, the US Army believed that the M4 would be adequate to win the war, and relatively little pressure was initially exerted for further tank development. Logistical and transport restrictions, such as limitations imposed by roads, ports, and bridges, also complicated the introduction of a more capable but heavier tank.<ref name=\"AGF 1943\">AGF policy statement.

These factors combined to give the Allies numerical superiority in most battles, and many infantry divisions were provided with M4s and tank destroyers.<ref group=N>By 1944, a typical U.S. infantry division had attached for armor support an M4 Sherman battalion, a tank destroyer battalion, or both.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Tank Tactics: From Normandy to Lorraine\" by Roman Jarymowycz {{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the Sherman, particularly the many improved and upgraded versions, continued to see combat service in many conflicts around the world, including the UN forces in the [[Korean War]], with Israel in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Arab\u2013Israeli wars]], briefly with South Vietnam in the [[Vietnam War]], and on both sides of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]].<ref name=Hunnicutt>Hunnicutt 1978{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==U.S. design prototype==\n[[File:Shermandriver.jpg|thumb|Cutaway Sherman showing transmission and driver's seat]]\n\nThe U.S. Army Ordnance Department designed the M4 medium tank as a replacement for the M3 medium tank. The M3 was an up-gunned development of the [[M2 Medium Tank]] of 1939, in turn derived from the [[M2 light tank]] of 1935. The M3 was developed as a stopgap measure until a new turret mounting a 75&nbsp;mm gun could be devised. While it was a big improvement when tried by the British in Africa against early German tanks, the placement of a 37&nbsp;mm gun turret on top gave it a very high profile, and the unusual side-sponson mounted main gun, with limited [[Gun laying|traverse]], could not be aimed across the other side of the tank. Though reluctant to adopt British weapons into their arsenal, the American designers were prepared to accept proven British ideas. British ideas, as embodied in a tank designed by the Canadian General Staff, also influenced the development of the American Sherman tank. Before long American military agencies and designers had accumulated sufficient experience to forge ahead on several points. In the field of tank armament the American 75&nbsp;mm and 76&nbsp;mm dual-purpose tank guns won the acknowledgement of British tank experts.<ref>''British War Production'' by Michael Postan (1952) p. 245</ref> Detailed design characteristics for the M4 were submitted by the Ordnance Department on 31 August 1940, but development of a prototype was delayed while the final production designs of the M3 were finished and the M3 entered full-scale production. On 18 April 1941, the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the M3's 75&nbsp;mm gun. This would later become the Sherman.<ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/>\n\nThe Sherman's reliability resulted from many features developed for U.S. light tanks during the 1930s, including [[vertical volute spring suspension]], rubber-bushed tracks, and a rear-mounted [[radial engine]] with drive sprockets in front. The goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank then in use by the [[Axis powers|Axis nations]].\n\nThe T6 prototype was completed on 2 September 1941. The upper hull of the T6 was a single large casting. It featured a single overhead hatch for the driver, and a hatch in the side of the hull. In the later M4A1 production model, this large casting was maintained, although the side hatch was eliminated and a second overhead hatch was added for the assistant driver. The modified T6 was standardized as the M4, and production began in February 1942.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20050729b |title=Opening Salvo: M4A1 Sherman Tank |first=Michael J. |last=Canavan |publisher=[[Avalon Hill]] / Wizards.com}}</ref> The cast-hull models would later be re-standardized as M4A1, with the first welded-hull models receiving the designation M4. In August, 1942, a variant of the M4 was put forth by the Detroit Arsenal to have angled, rather than rounded hull and turret armor. The changes were intended to improve the tank's protection without increasing weight or degrading other technical characteristics.\n\n===Doctrine===\n[[File:Sherman tank and Horsa glider.jpg|thumb|A Sherman [[DD tank|DD]] amphibious tank of 13th/18th Royal Hussars in action against German troops using crashed [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa]] gliders as cover near Ranville, [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]], 10 June 1944]]\n\nAs the United States approached entry into World War II, armored employment was doctrinally governed by [[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual&nbsp;100\u20135, Operations]] (published May 1941, the month following selection of the M4 tank's final design). That field manual stated:\n{{quote|The armored division is organized primarily to perform missions that require great mobility and firepower. It is given decisive missions. It is capable of engaging in all forms of combat, but its primary role is in offensive operations against hostile rear areas.<ref>{{cite book |author=War Department |authorlink=United States Department of War |title=FM&nbsp;100\u20135, Field Service Regulations, Operations |date=22 May 1941 |place=Washington, DC |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|GPO]] |type=reprint |oclc=49969146 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/FM100-5/index.html |accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe M4 was, therefore, not originally intended primarily as an [[Infantry tank|infantry support tank]]. It placed tanks in the \"striking echelon\" of the armored division, and placed the infantry in the \"support echelon\", without directing that tanks should only seek to attack other tanks, thus leaving target selection up to the field commander based on what types of units were available to him to attack. A field manual covering the use of the Sherman (FM 17\u201333, \"The Tank Battalion, Light and Medium\" of September 1942) described fighting enemy tanks when necessary as one of the many roles of the Sherman, but devoted only one page of text and four diagrams to tank-versus-tank action, out of 142 pages.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM17-33.PDF |title=FM 17\u201333}}</ref> This early armored doctrine was heavily influenced by the sweeping early war successes of German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics. By the time M4s reached combat in significant numbers, battlefield demands for infantry support and tank versus tank action far outnumbered the occasional opportunities of rear-echelon exploitation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nUnited States doctrine held that the most critical anti-tank work (stopping massed enemy tank attacks) was primarily to be done by towed and self-propelled anti-tank guns, both of which were referred to as \"tank destroyers\", with friendly tanks being used in support if possible.<ref>FM 100-5, Paragraph 680 and 685, 1941</ref> Speed was essential in order to bring the tank destroyers from the rear to destroy incoming tanks. This doctrine was rarely followed in combat, as it was found to be impractical. Commanders were reluctant to leave tank destroyers in reserve; if they were, it was also easier for an opposing armored force to achieve a breakthrough against an American tank battalion, which would not have all of its anti-tank weapons at the front during the beginning of any attack.<ref>''Tank Tactics: From Normandy to Lorraine'' by Roman Jarymowycz, Ch. 5 \"Creating North American Panzer Armies\"</ref>\n\n==U.S. production history==\n{{See also|American armored fighting vehicle production during World War II}}\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Bovington Tank Museum 276 SHERMAN 2.jpg|thumb|right|The second production Sherman, ''Michael'', displayed at [[The Tank Museum]], [[Bovington]], England (2010)]]\n[[File:Sherman Dresden 2.jpg|right|thumb|M4 and M4A1 (shown), the first Shermans, share the inverted U backplate and inherited their engine and exhaust system from the earlier M3 Medium Tank]]\n[[File:M4 Sherman tank at the Imperial War Museum.jpg|thumb|This M4A4 has extra armor plates in front of crew hatches]]\nThe first production of the Sherman took place at the [[Lima Locomotive Works]], producing them for British use.

A third of all Army tank battalions, and all six Marine tank battalions, were deployed to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] (PTO).<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 24, 301</ref> Prior to September 1942, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had announced a production program calling for 120,000 tanks for the Allied war effort. Although the American industrial complex was not affected by enemy [[Strategic bombing during World War II|aerial bombing]] nor [[submarine warfare]] as was [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Germany during World War II|Germany]] and, to a lesser degree, [[Great Britain]], an enormous amount of [[steel]] for tank production had been diverted to the construction of warships and other naval vessels.<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) pp. 22, 24, 28</ref> Steel used in naval construction amounted to the equivalent of approximately 67,000 tanks; and consequently only about 53,500 tanks were produced during 1942 and 1943.<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 24</ref>\n\nThe Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during production: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations did not necessarily indicate linear improvement; in that \"M4A4\" did not indicate it was better than \"M4A3\". These sub-types indicated standardized production variations, which were in fact often manufactured concurrently at different locations. The sub-types differed mainly in engines, although the M4A1 differed from the other variants by its fully cast upper hull, with a distinctive rounded appearance. The M4A4 had a longer engine system that required a longer hull and more track blocks, and thus the most distinguishing feature of the M4A4 was the wider longitudinal spacing between the bogies. \"M4A5\" was an administrative placeholder designation for [[Grizzly I cruiser|Canadian production]]. The M4A6 had a radial diesel engine as well as the elongated chassis of the M4A4, but only 75 of these were ever produced.\n\nMost Sherman sub-types ran on gasoline. The air cooled Continental-produced [[Wright R-975 Whirlwind|Wright R975 Whirlwind]] 9 cylinder radial gasoline engine in the M4 and M4A1 produced {{convert|350|or|400|hp|kW}}. The M4A3 used the liquid-cooled {{cvt|450|hp|kW}} [[Ford GAA engine|Ford GAA]] V8 gasoline engine, and the M4A4 used the liquid cooled {{cvt|370|hp|kW}} 30 cylinder [[Chrysler A57 multibank|Chrysler A57]] multibank gasoline engine. There were also two diesel engined variants. The M4A2 was powered by a pair of liquid cooled [[General Motors|GMC]] [[Detroit Diesel Series 71|6\u201371]] [[two-stroke]] inline engines,<ref>Berndt, Thomas. ''Standard Catalog of U.S. Military Vehicles'' (Krause Publications, 1993), pp. 192\u201393.</ref> that produced a total of {{cvt|375|hp|kW}}, while the M4A6 used an RD-1820 (a redesigned [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] D-200A air cooled [[Radial engine#Diesel radials|radial]] diesel engine, adapted from [[Wright Aeronautical]]'s [[Wright R-1820|''Cyclone 9'']] nine cylinder radial aircraft engine.<ref>Berndt, pp. 192\u201393.</ref>) that produced {{cvt|450|hp|kW}}. The M4A2 and M4A4 were mostly supplied to other Allied countries under [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>Berndt, pp. 190, 192\u201393.</ref> The term \"M4\" can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved while in production, without a change to the tank's basic model number. These included more durable suspension units, safer \"wet\" (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger or more effective armor arrangements, such as the M4 \"Composite\", which had a cheaper to produce cast front hull section mated to a regular welded rear hull. British nomenclature regarding Sherman variants differed from that employed by the U.S. A 24-volt electrical system was used in the M4.<ref name=\"Berndt, p.195\">Berndt, p. 195</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid #999; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; margin: 1en 1en 1en 0;\"\n|-\n|+ M4 Sherman: comparison of key production features of selected models\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | Designation\n!

Although Ordnance began work on the [[T20 medium tank]] series as Sherman replacements, ultimately the Army decided to minimize production disruption by incorporating elements of other tank designs into the Sherman. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger T23 turret with a high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1|76 mm gun]]. Later, the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer and a distinctive rounded [[mantlet]], which surrounded the main gun, on the turret. The first standard-production 76&nbsp;mm gun-armed Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, which first saw combat in July 1944 during [[Operation Cobra]]. The first Sherman to be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm howitzer was the M4, first accepted in February 1944.\n\nFrom May to July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 ''Jumbo'' Shermans, which had very thick hull armor and the 75&nbsp;mm gun in a new, far better protected T23-style turret, in order to assault fortifications. The M4A3 model was the first to be factory-produced with the horizontal volute spring suspension (HVSS) system, beginning in August 1944. With wider tracks to distribute weight, and the smooth ride of the HVSS, it gained the nickname \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet#Prior Alphabets|Easy Eight]]\" from its experimental E8 designation. The M4 and M4A3 105&nbsp;mm-armed tanks, as well as the M4A1 and M4A2 76&nbsp;mm-armed tanks, were also eventually equipped with HVSS. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman, although few saw combat, remaining experimental. Those that saw action included a bulldozer blade, the [[Duplex Drive]] system, flamethrowers for ''Zippo'' [[flame tank]]s, and various rocket launchers such as the [[T34 Calliope]]. British variants (DDs and [[mine flail]]s) formed part of the group of specialized vehicles collectively known as \"[[Hobart's Funnies]]\" (after [[Percy Hobart]], commander of the [[79th Armoured Division]]).\n\nThe M4 Sherman's basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force: roughly 49,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers.

However, the Chief of the Army's Armored Force, Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], ordered that no diesel-engined Shermans be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States, but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 (with the A57 Multibank engine) to be the primary Lend-Lease exports.\n\n===First combat===\nShermans were being issued in small numbers for familiarization to U.S. armored divisions when there was a turn of events in the [[North Africa Campaign|Western Desert campaign]]. Axis forces [[Battle of Gazala|had taken Tobruk]] and were advancing into Egypt and Britain's supply line through the [[Suez Canal]] was threatened. The US considered collecting all Shermans together so as to be able to send the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] under [[George S. Patton|Patton]] to reinforce Egypt, but delivering the Shermans directly to the British was quicker and over 300 \u2013 mostly M4A1s, but also including M4A2s \u2013 had arrived there by September 1942.<ref name=\"Fletcher p93\"/><ref>Hunnicutt p174</ref>\n\nThe Shermans were modified for desert warfare with sandshields over the tracks and other stowage. The Sherman first saw combat at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in October 1942 with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]]. At the start of the offensive, there were 252 tanks fit for action. These equipped the [[9th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|British 9th Armoured Brigade]] (with the [[2nd New Zealand Division|New Zealand Division]]), 2nd Armoured Brigade (1st Armoured Division) and 8th and 20th Armoured Brigades (10th Armoured Division). Their first encounter with tanks was against German Panzer III and IV tanks with long 50&nbsp;mm and 75&nbsp;mm guns engaging them at {{convert|2000|yards|m}}. There were losses to both sides.<ref>Hunnicutt pp. 175\u201476</ref>\n\nThe first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4s and M4A1s in [[Operation Torch]] the next month. On 6 December, near [[Tebourba|Tebourba, Tunisia]], a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment was lost to enemy tanks and anti-tank guns.<ref>Hunnicutt p178</ref>\n\nAdditional M4s and M4A1s replaced M3s in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaign.\n\nThe M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until late 1944, when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful {{cvt|500|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war. The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76&nbsp;mm gun in July 1944 was the M4A1, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, roughly half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76&nbsp;mm gun. The first HVSS-equipped Sherman to see combat was the M4A3(76)W in December 1944.\n\n===Eastern Front===\nThe M4A2s used by the Red Army were considered to be much-less prone to blow up due to ammunition detonation than their [[T-34|T-34/76]] but had a higher tendency to overturn in road accidents and collisions or because of rough terrain due to their much-higher center of gravity.<ref>[http://www.iremember.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=19 \u041b\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u2013 \u042f \u041f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044e. \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b. \u0423\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0412\u041e\u0412.] in Russian.</ref>\n\nUnder Lend-Lease, 4,102 M4A2 medium tanks were sent to the Soviet Union.

While the US Army fielded 16 armored divisions and 70 separate tank battalions during the war, only a third of the battalions and none of the divisions were deployed to the Pacific Theater.<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 301</ref> The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) deployed only their 2nd Tank Division to the Pacific during the war.<ref>Zaloga (Japanese Tanks) p. 37</ref> Armor from both sides mostly operated in jungle terrain that was poorly suited to armored warfare.

However, the M2 (produced in 1940) was newer by five years.<ref>Zaloga, p. 40</ref> By 1943, the IJA still used the Type 95 and [[Type 97 Chi-Ha]] medium tanks, while Allied forces were quickly replacing their light tanks with 75&nbsp;mm-armed M4s.<ref>Zaloga, p. 34</ref> The Chinese in India received 100 M4 Shermans and used them to great effect in the subsequent 1944 and 1945 offensives in the [[China Burma India Theater|CBI Battlefield]].\n\n[[File:Medium tank crosses Suicide Creek.jpg|thumb|As part of [[Operation Dexterity]], an M4A1 (75&nbsp;mm) advances through a tropical rain forest on [[New Britain]], in the South-West Pacific]]\nTo counter the Sherman,<ref>Zaloga, Stephen ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nbwZvfSPLTMC&pg=PA21 Japanese Tanks 1939\u201345]'' pp. 21\u201322</ref> the Japanese developed the [[Type 3 Chi-Nu]] and the heavier [[Type 4 Chi-To]]; both tanks were armed with 75&nbsp;mm guns, albeit of different type. Only 166 Type 3s and two Type 4s were built, and none saw combat; they were saved for the defense of the Japanese home islands, leaving 1930s vintage light and medium armor to do battle against 1940s built Allied light and medium armor.\n\nDuring these later years of the war, general purpose high explosive ammunition was preferred for fighting Japanese tanks because armor-piercing rounds, which had been designed for penetrating thicker steel, often went through the thin armor of the Type 95 Ha-Go (the most commonly encountered Japanese tank) and out the other side without stopping. Although the high-velocity guns of tank destroyers were useful for penetrating fortifications, M4s armed with flamethrowers were often deployed, as direct fire seldom destroyed Japanese fortifications.<ref>Zaloga, ''Armored Thunderbolt'', \"Bunker Blasters\" p. 215\u201317, 318 caption.</ref><ref>Zaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 35, \"tank guns could not penetrate bunkers\"</ref>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\n[[File:Sherman-korea.jpg|thumb|Last type in US service: M4A3(76)W HVSS Sherman used as artillery in firing position during the [[Korean War]]]]\n\nAfter World War II, the U.S. kept the M4A3E8 '\"Easy Eight\" in service, with either the 76&nbsp;mm gun or a 105&nbsp;mm M4 howitzer. The Sherman remained a common U.S. tank in the [[Korean War]], where it fought alongside the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. The M4A3(76)W HVSS Sherman and [[T-34]]-85 were comparable and could destroy each other at normal combat ranges, although the use of High Velocity Armor Piercing ammunition, advanced optics, and better crew training gave the Sherman an advantage.<ref name=\"Osprey Publications M26 Pershing\">{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Stephen |title=M26/M46 Pershing Tank 1943\u201353 |publisher=Osprey Publishing (UK) |location=City |year=2001 |isbn=1-84176-202-4}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref> The M4A3(76)W HVSS Sherman, using 76&nbsp;mm HVAP ammunition, destroyed 41 enemy tanks from July\u2013November 1950.

The U.S. continued to transfer Shermans to its allies, which contributed to widespread foreign use.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Force used Shermans from its creation in 1948 until the 1980s, having first acquired a single M4A2 lacking main armament from British forces as they withdrew from Israel.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lion and Lioness of the Line Volume 5|last=Manasherob|first=Robert|publisher=SabIngaMartin Publications|year=2010|isbn=978-0984143726|location=|pages=5\u20136, 26|via=}}</ref> The popularity of the tank (having now been re-armed) compared to the outdated, 1934-origin French [[Renault R35]] interwar light tanks with their 37&nbsp;mm short-barreled guns, which made up the bulk of the IDF's tank force, led to the purchase of 30 unarmed M4(105mm)s from Italian scrapyards.<ref name=\":0\" /> Three of these, plus the original M4A2, saw extensive service in the 1948-9 war of independence. The remainder were then serviced and rearmed with 75&nbsp;mm guns and components whenever these became available, composing a large part of Israeli tank forces for the next eight years. The 75&nbsp;mm-armed Shermans were replaced by M4A1 (76&nbsp;mm) Shermans imported from France before the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], after it was realised that their armor penetration was insufficient for combat against newer tanks such as the IDF Centurions as well as the T-34-85s being delivered to Egyptian forces.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lion and Lioness of the Line Volume 12|last=Manasherob|first=Robert|publisher=SabIngaMartin Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9841437-8-8|location=|pages=1\u20132|via=}}</ref> During further upgrades, the French military helped develop a conversion kit to upgrade about 300 Shermans to the long high-velocity 75&nbsp;mm gun CN 75-50 used in the [[AMX-13]].

Before the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, the Israeli Army upgraded about 180 M4A1(76)W HVSS Shermans with the French 105&nbsp;mm Mod\u00e8le F1 gun, re-engined them with Cummins diesel engines and designated the upgraded tank [[Super Sherman|Sherman M-51]]. The Sherman tanks, fighting alongside the 105&nbsp;mm Centurion ''Sh'ot Kal'' and M48 Patton tanks, were able to defeat the T-34/85, T-54/55/62 series, and IS-3 tanks used by the Egyptian and Syrian forces in the 1967 Six-Day War.<ref>Zaloga, Steven.

Developed from a land-based anti-aircraft gun, its size and weight made it too large to fit in the turret of the Sherman. Development on a new 76&nbsp;mm gun better-suited to the Sherman began in 1942.\n\nIn early 1942, tests began on the feasibility of mounting a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer into the turret of the Sherman. The basic [[M101 howitzer|105&nbsp;mm howitzer M2A1]] was found to be ill-designed for mounting in a tank turret, so it was completely redesigned and re-designated the 105&nbsp;mm howitzer M4. After modifications to the turret (concerning the balancing of the gun and the strength of the power traverse) and interior of the hull (concerning the stowage of the 105&nbsp;mm ammunition), the Ordnance Department expressed its approval of the project, and production of M4 tanks armed with 105&nbsp;mm howitzers began in February 1944.<ref>Hunnicutt pp. 208-210</ref>\n\nThe Sherman would enter combat in 1942 equipped with the [[75 mm Gun (US)#M3 2|75&nbsp;mm gun M3]], a 40-[[Caliber (artillery)#Barrel length|caliber]] gun that could penetrate {{convert|88|mm|in|abbr=on}} of unsloped [[rolled homogeneous armor]] (RHA) at {{convert|100|meters|yards}} and {{convert|73|mm|in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1000|meters|yards}} firing the usual M61 round.<ref name=\"M4A3\">{{cite book|last1=Bird |first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D.|title=WWII Ballistics: Armor and Gunnery|date=2001|publisher=Overmatch Press|pages=62\u201363}}</ref> Facing the early [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] in North Africa, the Sherman's gun could penetrate the frontal armor of these tanks at normal combat ranges, within {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. U.S. Army Intelligence discounted the arrival of the [[Tiger I]] in 1942 and the [[Panther tank]] in 1943, predicting that the Panther would be a heavy tank like the Tiger I, and doubted that many would be produced. There were also reports of British [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6 pdr]] (57&nbsp;mm) guns being able to destroy the Tiger I. However, this only happened at very close ranges and against the thinner side armor. Due to their misconceptions related to this, and also due to tests that seemed to prove that the 76&nbsp;mm gun was able to destroy both the Tiger and the Panther, the leadership of Army Ground Forces were not especially concerned by the Tiger I. The tests of the 76&nbsp;mm were later ruled inaccurate, with Eisenhower even remarking that he was wrongly told by Ordnance that the 76&nbsp;mm could knock out any German tank. The Army also failed to anticipate that the Germans would attempt to make the Panther the standard tank of their panzer divisions in 1944, supported by small numbers of Tiger I and IIs.<ref>Zaloga 2008, p. 94-97</ref>\n\nWhen the newly designed 76&nbsp;mm gun, known as the T1, was first installed in the M4 in 1943, it was found to unbalance the turret, and the gun barrel also protruded too far forward, making it more difficult to transport and susceptible to hitting the ground when the tank traveled over undulating terrain. The barrel length was reduced by {{convert|15|inch|mm|abbr=on}} (from 57 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] to 52), resulting in the M1 variant. Mounting this gun in the original M4 turret proved problematic, so the turret for the aborted T23 tank project was used instead for the definitive production version of the 76&nbsp;mm M4 Shermans,<ref>Zaloga pp. 106\u201308, 115\u201316</ref> along with a modified version of the gun known as the M1A1.\n\nDespite the Ordnance Department's development of new 76&nbsp;mm and 90&nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, the Army Ground Forces rejected their deployment as unnecessary. An attempt to upgrade the M4 Sherman by installing the 90&nbsp;mm-armed turret from the T26 tank project on an M4 hull in April 1944 was halted after realizing it could not go into production sooner than the T26 and would likely delay T26 development.<ref>Zaloga 2008, pp. 126\u201330</ref> Even in 1943, most German armored fighting vehicles (later models of the Panzer IV, [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]], and [[Marder III]]) mounted the [[7.5 cm KwK 40]]. As a result, even weakly armored light German tank destroyers such as the Marder III, which was meant to be a stop-gap measure to fight Soviet tanks in 1942, could destroy Shermans from a distance. The disparity in firepower between the German armored fighting vehicles of 1943 and the 75&nbsp;mm-armed M4 was the impetus to begin production of 76&nbsp;mm-armed M4s in January 1944.<ref>Zaloga pp. 115\u201316</ref> In testing prior to the [[invasion of Normandy]], the 76&nbsp;mm gun was found to have an undesirably large muzzle blast that kicked up dust from the ground and obscured vision for further firing. The M1A1C gun, which entered production lines in March 1944, was threaded for a muzzle brake, but as the brakes were still in development, the threads were protected with a cap. The addition of a [[muzzle brake]] on the new M1A2 gun (which also incorporated a faster rifling twist leading to a slight accuracy increase at longer ranges) beginning in October 1944 finally solved this problem by directing the blast sideways.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=M4 (76mm) Sherman Tank 1943\u201365|date=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing, Ltd|isbn=1841765422|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nArmy doctrine at the time emphasized the multirole ability of the tank, and the capability of the high explosive shell was considered important. Being a dedicated anti-tank gun, the 76&nbsp;mm had a much weaker high explosive shell than the existing 75&nbsp;mm, and was not initially accepted by various U.S. armored division commanders, even though many had already been produced and were available. All of the U.S. Army M4s deployed initially in Normandy in June 1944 had the 75&nbsp;mm gun.<ref>Zaloga 129\u2013131</ref> Tests against American armor plate suggested that the new M1A1 gun would be adequate, but testing against captured Panther tanks was never done. Fighting against Panther tanks in Normandy quickly demonstrated the need for better anti-tank firepower, and the 76&nbsp;mm M4s were deployed to [[First United States Army|First Army]] units in July 1944.

The projectile contained a [[tungsten]] penetrator surrounded by a lightweight aluminum body and ballistic windshield, which gave it a higher velocity and more penetrating power.

Out of expediency and also driven by delays in their new tank designs, they mounted the powerful {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun]] in a standard 75&nbsp;mm M4 Sherman turret. This conversion became the [[Sherman Firefly]]. Like the U.S. M1 gun, the 17 pdr was also a 76&nbsp;mm gun, but the British piece used a more voluminous cartridge case containing a much bigger propellant charge.

General Devers insisted on comparison tests between the 17-pounder and the U.S. 90&nbsp;mm gun. The tests were finally done on March 25 and May 23, 1944; they seemed to show the 90&nbsp;mm gun was equal to or better than the 17-pounder. By then, production of the 76&nbsp;mm-armed M4 and the 90&nbsp;mm-armed M36 were both underway and U.S. Army interest in the 17-pounder waned. Late in 1944, the British began to produce tungsten [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|sabot]] rounds for the 17-pounder, which could readily breach the armor of even the [[Tiger II]]; these were not as accurate as standard rounds and not generally available.\n\nAfter the heavy tank losses of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], in January 1945, General Eisenhower asked that no more 75&nbsp;mm M4s be sent to Europe: only 76&nbsp;mm M4s were wanted.<ref>Zaloga 2008, pp. 268\u201369</ref>\n\nInterest in mounting the British 17-pounder in U.S. Shermans flared anew. In February 1945, the U.S. Army began sending 75&nbsp;mm M4s to England for conversion to the 17-pounder. Approximately 100 conversions were completed by the beginning of May. By then, the end of the war in Europe was clearly in sight, and the U.S. Army decided the logistical difficulties of adding a new ammunition caliber to the supply train was not warranted. None of the converted 17-pounder M4s were deployed in combat by the U.S., and it is unclear what happened to most of them, although some were given to the British as part of Lend-Lease post-war.<ref>Zaloga 2008, pp. 276\u201377</ref>\n\n===The tank destroyer doctrine===\n\nGeneral [[Lesley J. McNair]] was head of the Army Ground Forces from 1942 to 1944. McNair, a former artilleryman, advocated for the role of the [[tank destroyer]] (TD) within the U.S. Army. In McNair's opinion, tanks were to exploit breakthroughs and support infantry, while masses of attacking hostile tanks were to be engaged by tank destroyer units, which were composed of a mix of self-propelled and towed anti-tank guns. Armored Force and Tank Destroyer Force doctrine were developed separately, and it was not against Armored Force doctrine for friendly tanks to engage hostile tanks while attacking or defending.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moran|first1=Nicholas|title=Myths of American Armor|url=http://worldoftanks.com/en/news/pc-browser/21/The_Chieftains_Hatch_American_Myths/|website=World of Tanks|publisher=Wargaming.net|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> The tank destroyers were to engage numbers of enemy tanks that broke through friendly lines. U.S. tank destroyers, called \"gun motor carriages\" (as were any U.S. Army self-propelled armored vehicles mounting an artillery piece of heavy caliber) were similar to tanks but were lightly armored with open-topped turrets. The tank destroyers were supposed to be faster and carry a more powerful anti-tank gun than tanks (although in reality tanks often received more powerful guns before tank destroyers did) and armor was sacrificed for speed.<ref>Zaloga 2008, \"McNair's Folly\" pp. 72\u201377</ref>\n\nMcNair approved the 76&nbsp;mm upgrade to the M4 Sherman and production of the 90&nbsp;mm gun-armed [[M36 tank destroyer]], but he at first staunchly opposed mass production of the [[T20 medium tank]] series and its descendants, the T25 and T26 (which would eventually become the [[M26 Pershing]]) during the crucial period of 1943 because they were not \"battle worthy\" and he saw no \"battle need\" for them. In fall 1943, Lieutenant General Devers, commander of U.S. forces in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO), asked for 250 T26 tanks for use in the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of France]]; McNair refused, citing the fact that he believed the M4 was adequate. Devers appealed all the way to the War Department, and Major General [[Russell L. Maxwell]], the Assistant Chief of Staff G-4 of the War Department General Staff, ordered the 250 tanks built in December 1943. McNair finally relented in his opposition, but still opposed mass production; his Army Ground Forces even asked for the tanks to be \"down-gunned\" from 90&nbsp;mm to 75 or 76&nbsp;mm in April 1944, believing the 76&nbsp;mm gun was capable of performing satisfactorily. Marshall then summarily ordered the tanks to be provided to the ETO as soon as possible. Soon after the [[Normandy invasion]] in June 1944, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] urgently requested heavy tanks, but McNair's continued opposition to mass production due to persistent serious mechanical problems with the vehicles delayed their procurement. That same month, the War Department reversed course and completely overruled the Army Ground Forces when making their tank production plan for 1945. 7,800 tanks were to be built, of which 2,060 were to be T26s armed with 90&nbsp;mm guns, 2,728 were to be T26s armed with 105&nbsp;mm howitzers, and 3,000 were to be M4A3 Sherman tanks armed with 105&nbsp;mm howitzers. As a part of the plan, the British requested 750 90&nbsp;mm-armed T26s and 200 105&nbsp;mm-armed T26s.<ref>Zaloga, Stephen. T-34-85 vs M26 Pershing: Korea 1950.

The stabilization was only in the vertical plane, as the mechanism could not slew the turret. The stabilizer was sufficient to keep the gun's elevation setting within 1/8th of a degree, or 2 mils while crossing moderately rough terrain at {{convert|15|mph|km/h}}. This gave a hit probability of 70% on enemy tanks at ranges of {{convert|300|yards|meters}} to {{convert|1200|yards|meters}}.<ref>\"Ohio State Engineer\", vol 28 number 4 (March 1945) pp. 10\u201311, 23.</ref> The utility of the stabilization is debatable, with some saying it was useful for its intended purpose, others only for using the sights for stabilized viewing on the move.<ref>\"M4 Sherman at War\" by Michael Green, James D.

In the close fighting of the French ''[[bocage]]'', the U.S. Army's [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] tanks used [[Rhino tank|Culin Hedgerow Cutters]] fitted to their tanks to push three tanks together through a hedgerow. The flank tanks would clear the back of the hedgerow on their side with canister rounds while the center tank would engage and suppress known or suspected enemy positions on the next hedgerow. This approach permitted surprisingly fast progress through the very tough and well-defended hedgerows in Normandy. Over 500 sets of these were fitted to US armored vehicles, and many fitted to various British tanks (where they were called \"Prongs\").\n\nThe 75&nbsp;mm gun had a [[white phosphorus]] shell originally intended for use as an artillery marker to help with targeting. M4 tank crews discovered that the shell could also be used against the Tiger and Panther\u2014when the burning white phosphorus adhered to the German tanks, their excellent optics would be blinded and the acrid smoke would get sucked inside the vehicle, making it difficult or impossible for the crew to breathe. This, and the fear of fire starting or spreading inside the tank, would sometimes cause the crew to abandon the tank.<ref>Zaloga 2008 p. 182</ref> There were several recorded instances where white phosphorus shells defeated German tanks in this fashion.<ref>Schneider 2004, p. 303</ref>\n\nA variant of the M4 Sherman was armed with the [[M101 howitzer|105&nbsp;mm M4 howitzer]], which provided even more powerful high explosive armament.

The new design improved overall ballistic protection by eliminating the \"hatchways\", while also allowing for larger hatches for the driver and bow gunner. The cast hull M4A1 for the most part retained its previous glacis shape even after the larger hatches were introduced; the casting, irrespective of the larger hatches, sat 37 to 55 degrees from the vertical, with the large majority of the piece sitting closer to a 55 degree angle.<ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/>\n\nThe transmission housing was rounded, made of three cast sections bolted together or cast as one piece. It ranged from {{convert|50.8|\u2013|108|mm|in|frac=4}} thick<ref name=\"Hart27\"/> The upper and lower hull sides were {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick,<ref name=\"Reid215\"/><ref name=\"Buckley110\">Buckley, p. 110</ref> and vertical,<ref name=\"Hart27\"/> while the upper hull rear was also {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, vertical or sloped at 10 degrees from the vertical. The lower hull rear, which protected the engine, was {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, sloped at 0 to 22 degrees from the vertical depending upon the variant.<ref name=\"afvdb.50megs.com\"/> The hull roof was {{convert|25.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Hart27\"/> The hull floor ranged from {{convert|25.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick under the driver and assistant driver's positions to {{convert|12.7|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick at the rear. The M4 had a hatch on the hull bottom to dispose of spent shell casings and to provide an emergency escape route. In the Pacific, Marines often used this Sherman feature in reverse to recover wounded infantry under fire.\n\n===Effectiveness===\nThe armor of the M4 was effective against most early war tank and anti-tank weapons,<ref name=\"Zaloga14\"/> but needed a compound angle to resist later German tank and anti-tank guns. The distinctive protruding \"hatchways\" of the early Sherman compromised the 56 degree-angled glacis plate, making them weak points where the effect of the glacis plate's slope was greatly reduced. In 1943, to make the thickness of these areas equal with the rest of the glacis plate, {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|thick}} appliqu\u00e9 armor plates were fitted in front of them.\n\nA [[Waffenamt|Waffenamt-Pr\u00fcfwesen 1]] report estimated<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Tiger 1 Heavy Tank 1942-45|date=1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1855323370|page=20}}</ref> that with the M4 angled 30 degrees sidewards, the Sherman's glacis plate was invulnerable to shots from the Tiger's 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 36 L/56<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|title=Tiger I Heavy Tank 1942\u201345|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=19}}</ref> and that the Panther, with its 7.5&nbsp;cm KwK 42 L/70, would have to close in to {{convert|100|meters|yards}} to achieve a penetration in the same situation.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995:128\">Jentz 1995:128</ref> Although the later-model German medium and heavy tanks were greatly feared, Buckley opined \"The vast majority of German tanks encountered in Normandy were either inferior or merely equal to the Sherman.\"<ref>Buckley, p. 117</ref>\n\nResearch for tank casualties in Normandy from 6 June to 10 July 1944 conducted by the British No. 2 [[Operations research|Operational Research]] concluded that, from a sample of 40 Sherman tanks, 33 tanks burned (82 percent) and 7 tanks remained unburned following an average of 1.89 penetrations. In comparison, from a sample of 5 Panzer IV's, 4 tanks burned (80 percent) and 1 tank remained unburned, following an average of 1.5 penetrations.

Buckley also notes that an American survey carried out concluded that 65% of tanks burned out after being penetrated.<ref name=\"Buckley127\">Buckley, p. 127</ref> United States Army research proved that the major reason for this was the stowage of main gun ammunition in the vulnerable sponsons above the tracks. A U.S. Army study in 1945 concluded that only 10\u201315 percent of wet stowage Shermans burned when penetrated, compared to 60\u201380 percent of the older dry-stowage Shermans.<ref name=\"Zaloga 2008, p. 116-118\">Zaloga (2008), pp. 116\u201318</ref>\n\nAt first, a partial remedy to ammunition fires in the M4 was found in 1943 by welding {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|thick}} appliqu\u00e9 armor plates to the sponson sides over the ammunition stowage bins, though there was doubt that these had any effect. Later models moved ammunition stowage to the hull floor, with water jackets surrounding each stowage bin.

Fuel fires occasionally occurred, but such fires were far less common and less deadly than ammunition fires.<ref name=\"Zaloga 2008, p. 116-118\"/> In many cases, the fuel tank of the Sherman was found intact after a fire. Tankers described \"fierce, blinding jets of flame\", which is inconsistent with gasoline-related fires.<ref name=\"Buckley127\"/>\n\n===Upgrades===\nUpgrades included the rectangular armor patches protecting ammunition stowage mentioned above, and smaller armor patches in front of each of the protruding hatchway structures in the glacis in an attempt to mitigate their ballistic weakness. Field improvisations included placing sandbags, spare track links, concrete, wire mesh, or even wood for increased protection against [[shaped-charge]] rounds. While mounting sandbags around a tank had little effect against high-velocity anti-tank gunfire it was thought to provide standoff protection against [[HEAT]] weapons, primarily the German ''Panzerfaust'' anti-tank grenade launcher and the [[bazooka]]-derived ''Panzerschreck'' 88&nbsp;mm calibre anti-tank rocket launcher. In the only study known to have been done to test the use of sandbags, on March 9, 1945, officers of the 1st Armored Group tested standard ''Panzerfaust'' 60s against sandbagged M4s; shots against the side blew away the sandbags and still penetrated the side armor, whereas shots fired at an angle against the front plate blew away some of the sandbags but failed to penetrate the armor. Earlier, in the summer of 1944, General Patton, informed by his ordnance officers that sandbags were useless and that the machines' chassis suffered from the extra weight, had forbidden the use of sandbags. Following the clamor for better armor and firepower after the losses of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], Patton ordered extra armor plates salvaged from knocked-out American and German tanks welded to the turrets and hulls of tanks of his command. Approximately 36 of these up-armored M4s were supplied to each of the three armored divisions of the Third Army in the spring of 1945.<ref>Zaloga (2008), pp. 279\u201384</ref>\n\n====M4A3E2====\n[[File:M4A3E2 Sherman Jumbo 75mm gun.jpg|thumb|M4A3E2 Sherman Jumbo.

Intended for the assault to break out of the Normandy beachhead, it was originally to be armed with the 76&nbsp;mm gun, but the 75&nbsp;mm was preferred for infantry support and was used. The higher weight required reducing maximum speed to 22&nbsp;mph, and crews were warned not to let the suspension \"bottom\" too violently. 254 were built at the Fisher Tank Arsenal from May to July 1944, and arrived in Europe in the fall of 1944, being employed throughout the remainder of the fighting in various roles. They were considered \"highly successful\".<ref>Hunnicutt, pp. 289\u2013290</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mobility==\n[[File:Volutespring.jpg|thumb|[[Vertical volute spring suspension|Vertical volute springs]] of [[Stuart tank]] with similar suspension system]]\n\nIn its initial specifications for a replacement for the M3 Medium Tank, the U.S. Army restricted the Sherman's height, width, and weight so that it could be transported via typical bridges, roads, railroads and landing craft without special accommodation. This greatly aided the strategic, logistical, and tactical flexibility and mobility of all Allied armored forces using the Sherman.\nA long-distance service trial conducted in Britain in 1943 compared diesel and gasoline Shermans to [[Cromwell tank]]s ([[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] engine) and Centaur ([[Liberty L-12]]). The British officer commanding the trial concluded \"They are utterly reliable.....I do not think they are quite as good as the Cromwell across country when they are running on rather worn rubber tracks and the going is greasy, neither does one get as smooth a ride, but they appear so infinitely superior in every other way particularly in reliability with a minimum of maintenance that this cross-country consideration is completely overweighed.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/chieftain/The_Chieftains_Hatch_Dracula/\n | title =Exercise Dracula\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =\n | website =The Chieftain's Hatch\n | publisher =World of Tanks\n | access-date =12 August 2017\n | quote = }}</ref>\n\nThe Sherman had good speed both on- and off-road. Off-road performance varied. In the desert, the Sherman's rubber-block tracks performed well; while in the confined, hilly terrain of Italy, the smaller and more nimble Sherman could often cross terrain that some heavy German tanks could not.\n\n[[Albert Speer]] recounted in his autobiography ''Inside the Third Reich:''\n{{quote|On the southwestern front (Italy) reports on the cross country mobility of the Sherman have been very favorable.

Lieutenant Colonel Wilson M. Hawkins of the 2nd Armored Division wrote the following comparing the U.S. M4 Sherman and German [[Panther tank|Panther]] in a report to Allied headquarters:\n{{quote|It has been claimed that our tank is the more maneuverable.

The U.S. Army issued extended end connectors, grousers or \"duckbills\", to add width to the standard tracks as a stopgap solution. Duckbills began to reach front-line tank battalions in July 1944, and were original factory equipment for the heavy M4A3E2 Jumbo to compensate for the extra weight of armor.

The Ram had a distinctive turret with a bolted flat-faced mantlet and the UK 6 pdr gun, with the hull machine gunner housed in a rotating turret based on the M3 'Lee' cupola, rather than the simpler ball-mount that was becoming universal for tank hull guns. Production facilities for the Ram were constructed at the [[Montreal Locomotive Works]], with the aid of [[ALCO|Alco]], but the large armor castings for turret and hull were supplied by General Steel Castings in the US.

It stars  [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Bill Irwin]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], and [[Michael Caine]]. Set in a [[dystopia]]n future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of [[astronaut]]s who travel through a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]] in search of a new home for humanity.\n\nBrothers Christopher and [[Jonathan Nolan]] wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced ''Interstellar'' with his wife, [[Emma Thomas]], through their production company [[Syncopy Inc.|Syncopy]], and with [[Lynda Obst]] through [[Lynda Obst Productions]]. [[Caltech]] theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]] was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, ''[[The Science of Interstellar]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Legendary Pictures]] co-financed the film. Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] shot it on [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] in [[anamorphic format]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 70 mm]]. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in [[Alberta]] (Canada), [[Iceland]] and [[Los Angeles]]. ''Interstellar'' uses extensive practical and [[miniature effect]]s and the company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] created additional [[Visual effect|digital effects]].\n\n''Interstellar'' premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on [[film stock]], expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million, making it the [[2014 in film|tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014]]. ''Interstellar'' received critical praise for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, acting, and ambition. At the [[87th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words -->\nIn 2067, crop [[blight]]s and [[dust storm]]s threaten [[Human extinction|humanity's survival]]. Corn is the last viable crop. The world has also regressed into a [[Post-truth politics|post-truth]] society where younger generations are taught ideas such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] moon missions [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|were faked]]. Widowed engineer and former [[NASA]] pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer. Living with him are his father-in-law, Donald; his 15-year-old son, Tom; and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy. After a storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear on Murphy's bedroom floor; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Murphy initially believes the patterns to be [[Morse code]]. However, Cooper eventually deduces that [[gravity]] variations caused the patterns and are a binary code for geographic coordinates. Cooper, accompanied by Murphy, who hides inside the truck, follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, Cooper's former supervisor. Professor Brand says gravitational anomalies have happened elsewhere. Forty-eight years earlier, unknown beings positioned a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]], opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a [[black hole]] named ''Gargantua''. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets. Astronauts Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel a mass exodus; utilizing gravity to 'jettison' artificial habitat stations into orbit and beyond. Plan B involves launching the ''Endurance'' spacecraft carrying 5,000 [[Cryopreservation|frozen]] human embryos to colonize a [[habitable planet]].\n\nAfter some persuasion, Cooper is recruited to pilot the ''Endurance by Professor John Brand''. The crew includes scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, Dr. Doyle, and robots TARS and CASE. Before leaving, Cooper gives a distraught Murphy his wristwatch to compare their [[relative time]] for when he returns. Murphy is upset that her father is leaving her because Cooper doesn't even know when he'll be back to earth. Cooper mentions to Murphy that by the time he gets back to earth, Cooper and Murphy may be the same age. After traversing the wormhole, Romilly studies the black hole while Cooper, Doyle, and Brand descend in a landing craft to investigate Miller's planet, an [[ocean world]]. The plan is to descend into the planet and get out as fast as possible. This is because of time dilation and every hour on the Miller's planet is 7 years on Earth. If the crew spends too much time on Miller's planet, too much time may pass and everyone would die on Earth. After finding wreckage from Miller's ship, a tidal wave as huge as a mountain kills Doyle and delays the lander's departure. Due to the proximity of the black hole, time is [[gravitational time dilation|severely dilated]]. As a result, 23 years and 4 months have elapsed for Romilly on ''Endurance'' by the time Cooper and Brand return a few hours later.\n\nWith the ''Endurance'' having only enough fuel to reach one planet, the crew debates on whether to go to Edmunds' planet, which has slightly better [[telemetry]], or Mann's planet, which is still sending positive data. Brand wants to go to Edmund's planet, but Cooper claims she wants to go there only because she is in love with Edmund. Cooper chooses Mann's planet. On Mann's planet, the ''Endurance'' crew revive him from [[cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryostasis]]. Meanwhile, Murphy, now a scientist, transmits a message announcing Professor Brand has died. She has learned that Plan A, requiring unattainable data from within a black hole, was never viable. Plan B was always Professor Brand's only option. The reason Professor Brand lied about Plan A being viable is to give everyone hope. Murphy accuses Amelia and Cooper of knowing those left on Earth were doomed. Mann's frozen planet is uninhabitable; he had sent falsified data in order to be rescued. Mann attempts to murder Cooper, then escapes in a lander and heads for ''Endurance''.  Romilly is killed by Mann's explosive booby trap and Amelia and Cooper race to the ''Endurance'' in another lander. Mann dies during a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging ''Endurance''. The explosion causes the endurance to spin and slowly descend into Miller's planet. However, after a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control of ''Endurance''.\n\n[[File:Black hole Interstellar.png|thumb|227px|right|Miller's planet orbiting ''Gargantua'']]\n\nWith insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, Cooper and Amelia plan to use a [[Gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] by using Gargantua's gravity to propel them towards Edmund's planet. However, being so close to Gargantua's gravity, time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper tricks Amelia by ejecting himself and TARS  to shed weight to ensure the ''Endurance'' reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the [[event horizon]] of ''Gargantua'', Cooper and TARS eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive ''tesseract'', possibly constructed by future humans. Across different time periods, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Cooper realizes he was Murphy's \"ghost\" and manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her, using [[Morse code]] to transmit the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon. Cooper and TARS are ejected from the tesseract. Cooper awakens on a [[space habitat]] orbiting Saturn, where he reunites with an elderly Murphy. Using the quantum data sent by Cooper, the younger Murphy solved the gravitational propulsion theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's exodus and survival. Nearing death and with her own family, Murphy urges Cooper to return to Amelia. Cooper , who is now 124 years old ,along with TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Amelia and CASE, who have begun to colonize Edmunds' planet. It should be noted that the ending scene, Amelia can be seen crouching over a burial grave, possibly of Edmund's. \n\n==Cast==\n\n<!-- See the talk page before making changes to the listed cast. -->\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Joseph Cooper\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Amelia Brand\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Murphy Cooper\n** [[Mackenzie Foy]] as young Murphy\n** [[Ellen Burstyn]] as old Murphy\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mann\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Donald\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Professor Brand\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Tom Cooper\n** [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as young Tom\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Doyle\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as TARS {{small|(voice and puppetry)}} and CASE {{small|(puppetry)}}\n* [[Josh Stewart]] as CASE {{small|(voice)}}\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Getty\n* [[David Gyasi]] as Romilly\n* [[Leah Cairns]] as Lois\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as School Principal\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Ms. Hanley\n* [[William Devane]] as Williams\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as Administrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Christopher Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Director, producer, writer\n* [[Jonathan Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Writer\n* [[Emma Thomas]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Lynda Obst]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Hoyte van Hoytema]]&nbsp;\u2013 Cinematographer\n* [[Nathan Crowley]]&nbsp;\u2013 Production designer\n* [[Mary Zophres]]&nbsp;\u2013 Costume designer\n* [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 Editor\n* [[Hans Zimmer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Music composer\n* [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Visual effects supervisor\n* [[Kip Thorne]]&nbsp;\u2013 Consultant, executive producer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Development and financing===\nThe premise for ''Interstellar'' was conceived by producer [[Lynda Obst]] and theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]], who collaborated on the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), and had known each other since [[Carl Sagan]] set them up on a blind date.<ref name=\"jolin\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> The two conceived of a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans,\" and attracted filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]]'s interest in directing.<ref name=\"Fernandez-Mar2007\" /> The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne.

Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate \"A-list\" property.<ref name=\"Kit-Masters-Jun2013\" /> In August 2013, [[Legendary Pictures]] finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forego financing ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) in exchange for the stake in ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"galloway20130814\" />\n\n===Writing and casting===\n[[File:Dust-storm-Texas-1935.png|thumb|right|The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon of the 1930s, as documented by [[Ken Burns]] in ''[[The Dust Bowl (film)|The Dust Bowl]]'' (2012), served as inspiration for the blight.]]\nScreenwriter Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> To learn the scientific aspects, he studied [[theory of relativity|relativity]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].<ref name=\"OraTV-Apr2014\" /> Jonathan was pessimistic about the [[Space Shuttle program]] ending and how NASA lacked financing for a [[manned mission to Mars]], drawing inspiration from science fiction films with [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] themes, such as ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008) and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009). Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented: \"He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.\"<ref name=\"jensen\" /> His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts, but decided to take the ''Interstellar'' script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne, picking what he felt, as director, he could get \"across to the audience and hopefully not lose them,\" before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /><ref name=\"marlow\" /> Christopher kept in place Jonathan's conception of the first hour, which is set on a [[resource depletion|resource depleted]] Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the [[Dust Bowl]] that took place in the United States during the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> After watching the 2012 documentary ''[[The Dust Bowl (film)|The Dust Bowl]]'' for inspiration, Christopher contacted director [[Ken Burns]] and producer Dayton Duncan, requesting permission to use some of their featured interviews in ''Interstellar'', which was granted.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\nChristopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an [[everyman]] with whom \"the audience could experience the story.\"<ref name=\"mcclintock20140326\" /> He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film ''[[Mud (2012 film)|Mud]]'',<ref name=\"mcclintock20140326\" /> which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series ''[[True Detective]]''.<ref name=\"td\" /> Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan's home, where she read the script for ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"itzkoff\" /> In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles.<ref name=\"Fleming-Apr2013\" /> Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on ''[[Miss Julie (2014 film)|Miss Julie]]'' (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.<ref name=\"itzkoff\" /> Matt Damon was cast in late August 2013 in a supporting role and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.<ref name=\"jagernauth\" />\n\n===Principal photography===\nNolan filmed ''Interstellar'' on [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] in [[anamorphic format]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 70 mm]] photography.<ref name=\"deadline\" /> Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] was hired for ''Interstellar'', as [[Wally Pfister]], Nolan's cinematographer on all of his past films, was making his directorial debut working on ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"Jagernauth-Apr2013\" /> More IMAX cameras were used for ''Interstellar'' than for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), the director had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.<ref name=\"mcclintock20140326\" /> Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be [[Hand-held camera|hand held]] for shooting interior scenes.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nosecone of a [[Learjet]].<ref name=\"Learjet\" />\n\nNolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for ''Interstellar''. Writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... ''Interstellar'', just as he did with the blockbuster ''Dark Knight'' trilogy.\"<ref name=\"WSJ-Oct2013\" /> As one security measure, ''Interstellar'' was filmed under the name ''Flora's Letter'',<ref name=\"volmers\" /> Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\n[[File:Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull.JPG|thumbnail|right|The Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull glacier in [[Iceland]] was used as a filming location for ''Interstellar'', doubling for Mann's planet.]]\n\nThe film's [[principal photography]] was scheduled to last four months.<ref name=\"jagernauth\" /> It began on {{nowrap|August 6}}, 2013, in the province of [[Alberta]], Canada.<ref name=\"galloway20130814\" /> Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included [[Nanton, Alberta|Nanton]], [[Longview, Alberta|Longview]], [[Lethbridge]], [[Fort Macleod]], and [[Okotoks]]. In Okotoks, filming took place at the [[Seaman Stadium]] and the Olde Town Plaza.<ref name=\"volmers\" /> For a cornfield scene, production designer [[Nathan Crowley]] planted {{convert|500|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic [[dust storm]] scene,<ref name=\"jensen\" /> intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /> Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot in [[Fort Macleod]], where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow [[Cellulose fiber|cellulose-based]] synthetic dust through the air.<ref name=\"McTighe-Aug2013\" /> Filming in the province lasted until {{nowrap|September 9}}, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to {{nowrap|130 crew}} members, most of whom were local.<ref name=\"volmers\" /> Shooting also took place in [[Iceland]], where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).<ref name=\"Verrier-Horn-Apr2014\" /> The location was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about {{convert|10000|lb|disp=flip}} to the country.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /> They spent two weeks shooting there,<ref name=\"jagernauth\" /> during which a crew of approximately {{nowrap|350 people}}, including {{nowrap|130 locals}}, worked on the film. Locations included the Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull glacier and the town of [[Kirkjub\u00e6jarklaustur|Klaustur]].<ref name=\"NewsofIceland-Sep2013\" /><ref name=\"IcelandReview-Sep2013\" /> While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered [[hypothermia]] because the [[dry suit]] she was wearing had not been properly secured.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\nAfter the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew moved to Los Angeles to shoot for {{nowrap|54 days}}. Filming locations included the [[Westin Bonaventure Hotel|Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites]], the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]], a Sony Pictures [[soundstage]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], and a private residence in [[Altadena, California]].<ref name=\"Verrier-Nov2013\" /> Principal photography concluded in December 2013.<ref name=\"Zeitchik-Dec2013\" /> Production had a budget of {{nowrap|$165 million}}, {{nowrap|$10 million}} less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\n===Production design===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer    = The ''Endurance'' spacecraft (left) is based on the [[International Space Station]] (right).\n| image1    = Interstellar film - Endurance spacecraft.jpg\n| width1    = 167\n| alt1      =\n| image2    = S130e012150.jpg\n| width2    = 150\n| alt2      =\n}}\n''Interstellar'' features three spacecraft&nbsp;\u2014 the Ranger, the ''Endurance'', and the Lander. The Ranger's function is similar to the [[Space Shuttle]]'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The ''Endurance'', the crew's [[mother ship]], has a circular structure formed by 12 capsules&nbsp;\u2014 four with planetary colonization equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the ''Endurance'' was based on the [[International Space Station]]: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need back-up systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with colonization equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"<ref name=\"jolin\" />\n\nThe film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and chose a {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}} [[quadrilateral]] design. The director said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines&nbsp;\u2014 those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Actor [[Bill Irwin]] voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film, and actor [[Josh Stewart]]'s voice replaced his voicing for CASE.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> The human space habitats resemble [[O'Neill cylinder]]s, a theoretical space colony model proposed by physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] in 1976.<ref name=\"GQ-Oct2014\" />\n\n===Sound design and music===\n{{Main|Interstellar (soundtrack)}}\n[[Gregg Landaker]] and [[Gary Rizzo]] were the film's [[audio engineer]]s tasked with [[audio mixing]], while sound editor [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]] supervised the process.<ref name=\"Desowitz-Sep2014\" /> Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment<ref name=\"Hammond-Mar2014\" /> and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.<ref name=\"jensen\" /> The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the [[subwoofer]] channel.\"<ref name=\"InterstellarMovie\" /> Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.<ref name=\"McClintock-Nov2014\" />\n\nComposer [[Hans Zimmer]], who scored Nolan's Batman film trilogy and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), returned to score ''Interstellar''. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details for writing the film's music, but instead gave the composer a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the ''Interstellar'' soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided that a 1926 four-manual [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ would be the primary instrument for the score.<ref name=\"Lubin-Nov2014\" /><ref name=\"Kilkenny\" /> Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for ''Interstellar'', three times more than for ''Inception''. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.<ref name=\"jensen\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], which worked on ''Inception'', was brought back for ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"Giardina-Jun2014\" /> According to visual effects supervisor [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]], the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012) or ''Inception''. However, for ''Interstellar'' they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of [[Chroma key|green screens]].<ref name=\"jolin\" /> Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 \u00d7 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.<ref name=\"VFXshots\" />\n\nThe Ranger, ''Endurance'', and Lander spacecraft were created using [[miniature effect]]s by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. [[3D printing|3D printed]] and hand sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th scale miniature of the ''Endurance'' module spanned over {{convert|7.6|m|abbr=on}}, while a [[pyrotechnic]] model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} and over {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}, respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis [[gimbal]] on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using [[VistaVision]] cameras on a smaller motion control rig.<ref name=\"EmanuelLevy-Oct2014\" /> New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.<ref name=\"VFXshots\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe director was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982),<ref name=\"EW-Apr2013\" /> ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"Empire-Oct2014\" /> [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,<ref name=\"Mueller-Oct2014\" /> who also compared ''Interstellar'' to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948) as a film about human nature.<ref name=\"Jensen-Oct2014\" /> He sought to emulate films like [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983) for the crew before production,<ref name=\"jolin\" /> following in its example by capturing reflections on the ''Interstellar'' astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, the director invited former astronaut [[Marsha Ivins]] to the set.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /> Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker [[Toni Myers]] for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.<ref name=\"Space-Nov2014\" /> [[Clark Kent]]'s upbringing in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.<ref name=\"marlow\"/> Apart from films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\n==Scientific accuracy==\n[[File:Kip S. Thorne EM1B8790 (24027017497).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kip Thorne]], a theoretical physicist, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.]]\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne stated that he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole\u2014so what you see is based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] [[Einstein field equations|equations]].\"<ref name=\"ThorneWormhole\" /> Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" /> At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.<ref name=\"NPR-Nov2014\" /> According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" />\n\nAstrobiologist [[David Grinspoon]] criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.<ref name=\"MotherJones-Nov2014\" /> [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], an [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], explored the science behind the ending of ''Interstellar'', concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it.\"<ref name=\"Gray\" /> Theoretical physicist [[Michio Kaku]] praised the film for its scientific accuracy and has said ''Interstellar'' \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come.\" Similarly, Timothy Reyes, a former NASA [[software engineer]], said \"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent.\"<ref name=\"Mashable\" />\n\n===Wormholes and black holes===\nTo create the wormhole and a [[rotating black hole|rotating]], [[supermassive black hole]] (possessing an [[ergosphere]], as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced [[Theoretical Physics|theoretical equations]] to the engineers, who then wrote new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the [[gravitational lensing]] caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 [[terabyte]]s of data.<ref name=\"wired\" /> The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and [[accretion disk]]s surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three [[scientific papers]].<ref name=\"IOP-Feb2015\" /><ref name=\"AJP-Jun2015\" /><ref name=\"ACM-Jul2015\" />\n\nChristopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the [[Doppler effect]] which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.<ref name=\"NewScientist-Feb2015\" /> Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.<ref name=\"dailymail\" />\n\nAccording to [[Space.com]], the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is considered scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.<ref name=\"Wall-Nov2014\" /> Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature\u2014about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough [[gamma radiation]] and [[X-ray]]s to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.<ref name=\"InsideScience-Nov2015\" /> ''Futura-Sciences'' praised the correct depiction of the [[Penrose process]].<ref name=\"FX-Jan2016\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nThe teaser trailer for ''Interstellar'' debuted {{nowrap|December 13}}, 2013, and featured clips related to [[space exploration]], accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character Coop.<ref name=\"McIntyre-Dec2013\" /> The theatrical trailer debuted {{nowrap|May 5}}, 2014, at the [[Lockheed Martin]] IMAX Theater in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was made available online later that month.

It stars  [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Bill Irwin]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], and [[Michael Caine]]. Set in a [[dystopia]]n future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of [[astronaut]]s who travel through a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]] in search of a new home for humanity.\n\nBrothers Christopher and [[Jonathan Nolan]] wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced ''Interstellar'' with his wife, [[Emma Thomas]], through their production company [[Syncopy Inc.|Syncopy]], and with [[Lynda Obst]] through [[Lynda Obst Productions]]. [[Caltech]] theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]] was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, ''[[The Science of Interstellar]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Legendary Pictures]] co-financed the film. Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] shot it on [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] in [[anamorphic format]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 70 mm]]. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in [[Alberta]] (Canada), [[Iceland]] and [[Los Angeles]]. ''Interstellar'' uses extensive practical and [[miniature effect]]s and the company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] created additional [[Visual effect|digital effects]].\n\n''Interstellar'' premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on [[film stock]], expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million, making it the [[2014 in film|tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014]]. ''Interstellar'' received critical praise for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, acting, and ambition. At the [[87th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words -->\nIn 2067, crop [[blight]]s and [[dust storm]]s threaten [[Human extinction|humanity's survival]]. Corn is the last viable crop. The world has also regressed into a [[Post-truth politics|post-truth]] society where younger generations are taught ideas such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] moon missions [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|were faked]]. Widowed engineer and former [[NASA]] pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer. Living with him are his father-in-law, Donald; his 15-year-old son, Tom; and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy. After a storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear on Murphy's bedroom floor; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Cooper eventually deduces that [[gravity]] variations caused the patterns and are a binary code for geographic coordinates. Cooper, accompanied by Murphy, who hides inside the truck, follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, Cooper's former supervisor. Professor Brand says gravitational anomalies have happened elsewhere. Forty-eight years earlier, unknown beings positioned a [[wormhole]] near [[Saturn]], opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a [[black hole]] named ''Gargantua''. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets. Astronauts Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel a mass exodus; utilising gravity to 'jettison' artificial habitat stations into orbit and beyond. Plan B involves launching the ''Endurance'' spacecraft carrying 5,000 [[Cryopreservation|frozen]] human embryos to colonize a [[habitable planet]].\n\nCooper is recruited to pilot the ''Endurance''. The crew includes scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, Dr. Doyle, and robots TARS and CASE. Before leaving, Cooper gives a distraught Murphy his wristwatch to compare their [[relative time]] for when he returns. After traversing the wormhole, Romilly studies the black hole while Cooper, Doyle, and Brand descend in a landing craft to investigate Miller's planet, an [[ocean world]]. After finding wreckage from Miller's ship, a  tidal wave as huge as a mountain  kills Doyle and delays the lander's departure. Due to the proximity of the black hole, time is [[gravitational time dilation|severely dilated]]. As a result, 23 years and 4 months have elapsed for Romilly on ''Endurance'' by the time Cooper and Brand return a few hours later.\n\nWith the ''Endurance'' having only enough fuel to reach one planet, the crew debates on whether to go to Edmunds' planet, which has slightly better [[telemetry]], or Mann's planet, which is still sending positive data. Brand wants to go to Edmund's planet, but Cooper claims she wants to go there only because she is in love with Edmund. Cooper chooses Mann's planet. On Mann's planet, the ''Endurance'' crew revive him from [[cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryostasis]]. Meanwhile, Murphy, now a scientist, transmits a message announcing Professor Brand has died. She has learned that Plan A, requiring unattainable data from within a black hole, was never viable. Plan B was always Professor Brand's only option. Murphy accuses Amelia and Cooper of knowing those left on Earth were doomed. Mann's frozen planet is uninhabitable; he had sent falsified data in order to be rescued. Mann attempts to murder Cooper, then escapes in a lander and heads for ''Endurance''.  Romilly is killed by Mann's explosive booby trap and Amelia and Cooper race to the ''Endurance'' in another lander. Mann dies during a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging ''Endurance''. After a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control of ''Endurance''.\n\n[[File:Black hole Interstellar.png|thumb|227px|right|Miller's planet orbiting ''Gargantua'']]\n\nWith insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, they use a [[Gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] so close to ''Gargantua'' that time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and TARS eject themselves to shed weight and ensure ''Endurance'' reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the [[event horizon]] of ''Gargantua'', they eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive ''tesseract'', possibly constructed by future humans. Across different time periods, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Cooper realizes he was Murphy's \"ghost\" and manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her, using [[Morse code]] to transmit the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon. Cooper and TARS are ejected from the tesseract. Cooper awakens on a [[space habitat]] orbiting Saturn, where he reunites with an elderly Murphy. Using the quantum data sent by Cooper, the younger Murphy solved the gravitational propulsion theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's exodus and survival. Nearing death and with her own family, Murphy urges Cooper to return to Amelia. Cooper , who is now 124 years old ,along with TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Amelia and CASE, who have begun to colonize Edmunds' planet.\n\n==Cast==\n\n<!-- See the talk page before making changes to the listed cast. -->\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Joseph Cooper\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Amelia Brand\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Murphy Cooper\n** [[Mackenzie Foy]] as young Murphy\n** [[Ellen Burstyn]] as old Murphy\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mann\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Donald\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Professor Brand\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Tom Cooper\n** [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as young Tom\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Doyle\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as TARS {{small|(voice and puppetry)}} and CASE {{small|(puppetry)}}\n* [[Josh Stewart]] as CASE {{small|(voice)}}\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Getty\n* [[David Gyasi]] as Romilly\n* [[Leah Cairns]] as Lois\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as School Principal\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Ms. Hanley\n* [[William Devane]] as Williams\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as Administrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Christopher Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Director, producer, writer\n* [[Jonathan Nolan]]&nbsp;\u2013 Writer\n* [[Emma Thomas]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Lynda Obst]]&nbsp;\u2013 Producer\n* [[Hoyte van Hoytema]]&nbsp;\u2013 Cinematographer\n* [[Nathan Crowley]]&nbsp;\u2013 Production designer\n* [[Mary Zophres]]&nbsp;\u2013 Costume designer\n* [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 Editor\n* [[Hans Zimmer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Music composer\n* [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Visual effects supervisor\n* [[Kip Thorne]]&nbsp;\u2013 Consultant, executive producer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Development and financing===\nThe premise for ''Interstellar'' was conceived by producer [[Lynda Obst]] and theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]], who collaborated on the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), and had known each other since [[Carl Sagan]] set them up on a blind date.<ref name=\"jolin\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> The two conceived of a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans,\" and attracted filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]]'s interest in directing.<ref name=\"Fernandez-Mar2007\" /> The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne.

Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.<ref name=\"jensen\" /> Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of [[spacetime]] in the story.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /> In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"Variety-Jan2013\" /> Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of [[human spaceflight]],<ref name=\"fritz\" /> and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.<ref name=\"Deadline-Jan2013\" /> By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct ''Interstellar'', which would be produced under his label [[Syncopy Inc.|Syncopy]] and [[Lynda Obst Productions]].<ref name=\"HR-Mar2013\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said Nolan would earn a salary of {{nowrap|$20 million}} against 20% of the total gross.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter-Oct2014\" /> To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the [[Interplanetary Transport System|private space program]] at [[SpaceX]].<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\nWarner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan's production of ''Interstellar'' from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the TV series ''[[South Park]]''. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate \"A-list\" property.<ref name=\"Kit-Masters-Jun2013\" /> In August 2013, [[Legendary Pictures]] finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forego financing ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) in exchange for the stake in ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"galloway20130814\" />\n\n===Writing and casting===\n[[File:Dust-storm-Texas-1935.png|thumb|right|The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon of the 1930s, as documented by [[Ken Burns]] in ''[[The Dust Bowl (film)|The Dust Bowl]]'' (2012), served as inspiration for the blight.]]\nScreenwriter Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> To learn the scientific aspects, he studied [[theory of relativity|relativity]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].<ref name=\"OraTV-Apr2014\" /> Jonathan was pessimistic about the [[Space Shuttle program]] ending and how NASA lacked financing for a [[manned mission to Mars]], drawing inspiration from science fiction films with [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] themes, such as ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008) and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009). Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented: \"He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.\"<ref name=\"jensen\" /> His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts, but decided to take the ''Interstellar'' script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne, picking what he felt, as director, he could get \"across to the audience and hopefully not lose them,\" before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /><ref name=\"marlow\" /> Christopher kept in place Jonathan's conception of the first hour, which is set on a [[resource depletion|resource depleted]] Earth in the near future.

The Ranger's function is similar to the [[Space Shuttle]]'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The ''Endurance'', the crew's [[mother ship]], has a circular structure formed by 12 capsules&nbsp;\u2014 four with planetary colonization equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the ''Endurance'' was based on the [[International Space Station]]: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need back-up systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with colonization equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"<ref name=\"jolin\" />\n\nThe film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and chose a {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}} [[quadrilateral]] design. The director said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines&nbsp;\u2014 those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Actor [[Bill Irwin]] voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film, and actor [[Josh Stewart]]'s voice replaced his voicing for CASE.<ref name=\"jolin\" /> The human space habitats resemble [[O'Neill cylinder]]s, a theoretical space colony model proposed by physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] in 1976.<ref name=\"GQ-Oct2014\" />\n\n===Sound design and music===\n{{Main|Interstellar (soundtrack)}}\n[[Gregg Landaker]] and [[Gary Rizzo]] were the film's [[audio engineer]]s tasked with [[audio mixing]], while sound editor [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]] supervised the process.<ref name=\"Desowitz-Sep2014\" /> Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment<ref name=\"Hammond-Mar2014\" /> and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.<ref name=\"jensen\" /> The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the [[subwoofer]] channel.\"<ref name=\"InterstellarMovie\" /> Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.<ref name=\"McClintock-Nov2014\" />\n\nComposer [[Hans Zimmer]], who scored Nolan's Batman film trilogy and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), returned to score ''Interstellar''. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details for writing the film's music, but instead gave the composer a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the ''Interstellar'' soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided that a 1926 four-manual [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ would be the primary instrument for the score.<ref name=\"Lubin-Nov2014\" /><ref name=\"Kilkenny\" /> Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for ''Interstellar'', three times more than for ''Inception''. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.<ref name=\"jensen\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], which worked on ''Inception'', was brought back for ''Interstellar''.<ref name=\"Giardina-Jun2014\" /> According to visual effects supervisor [[Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)|Paul Franklin]], the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012) or ''Inception''. However, for ''Interstellar'' they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of [[Chroma key|green screens]].<ref name=\"jolin\" /> Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 \u00d7 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.<ref name=\"VFXshots\" />\n\nThe Ranger, ''Endurance'', and Lander spacecraft were created using [[miniature effect]]s by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. [[3D printing|3D printed]] and hand sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th scale miniature of the ''Endurance'' module spanned over {{convert|7.6|m|abbr=on}}, while a [[pyrotechnic]] model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} and over {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}, respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis [[gimbal]] on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using [[VistaVision]] cameras on a smaller motion control rig.<ref name=\"EmanuelLevy-Oct2014\" /> New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.<ref name=\"VFXshots\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe director was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982),<ref name=\"EW-Apr2013\" /> ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"Empire-Oct2014\" /> [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,<ref name=\"Mueller-Oct2014\" /> who also compared ''Interstellar'' to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948) as a film about human nature.<ref name=\"Jensen-Oct2014\" /> He sought to emulate films like [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983) for the crew before production,<ref name=\"jolin\" /> following in its example by capturing reflections on the ''Interstellar'' astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, the director invited former astronaut [[Marsha Ivins]] to the set.<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" /> Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker [[Toni Myers]] for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.<ref name=\"Space-Nov2014\" /> [[Clark Kent]]'s upbringing in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.<ref name=\"marlow\"/> Apart from films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=\"galloway20141022\" />\n\n==Scientific accuracy==\n[[File:Kip S. Thorne EM1B8790 (24027017497).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kip Thorne]], a theoretical physicist, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.]]\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne stated that he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole\u2014so what you see is based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] [[Einstein field equations|equations]].\"<ref name=\"ThorneWormhole\" /> Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" /> At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.<ref name=\"NPR-Nov2014\" /> According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.<ref name=\"news.sciencemag.org\" />\n\nAstrobiologist [[David Grinspoon]] criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.<ref name=\"MotherJones-Nov2014\" /> [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], an [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], explored the science behind the ending of ''Interstellar'', concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it.\"<ref name=\"Gray\" /> Theoretical physicist [[Michio Kaku]] praised the film for its scientific accuracy and has said ''Interstellar'' \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come.\" Similarly, Timothy Reyes, a former NASA [[software engineer]], said \"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent.\"<ref name=\"Mashable\" />\n\n===Wormholes and black holes===\nTo create the wormhole and a [[rotating black hole|rotating]], [[supermassive black hole]] (possessing an [[ergosphere]], as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced [[Theoretical Physics|theoretical equations]] to the engineers, who then wrote new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the [[gravitational lensing]] caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 [[terabyte]]s of data.<ref name=\"wired\" /> The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and [[accretion disk]]s surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three [[scientific papers]].<ref name=\"IOP-Feb2015\" /><ref name=\"AJP-Jun2015\" /><ref name=\"ACM-Jul2015\" />\n\nChristopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the [[Doppler effect]] which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.<ref name=\"NewScientist-Feb2015\" /> Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.<ref name=\"dailymail\" />\n\nAccording to [[Space.com]], the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is considered scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.<ref name=\"Wall-Nov2014\" /> Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature\u2014about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough [[gamma radiation]] and [[X-ray]]s to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.<ref name=\"InsideScience-Nov2015\" /> ''Futura-Sciences'' praised the correct depiction of the [[Penrose process]].<ref name=\"FX-Jan2016\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nThe teaser trailer for ''Interstellar'' debuted {{nowrap|December 13}}, 2013, and featured clips related to [[space exploration]], accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character Coop.<ref name=\"McIntyre-Dec2013\" /> The theatrical trailer debuted {{nowrap|May 5}}, 2014, at the [[Lockheed Martin]] IMAX Theater in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was made available online later that month.

Smooth surfaces, such as a [[sphere]], are assigned surface area using their representation as [[parametric surface]]s. This definition of surface area is based on methods of [[infinitesimal]] [[calculus]] and involves [[partial derivative]]s and [[double integration]].\n\nA general definition of surface area was sought by [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] at the turn of the twentieth century. Their work led to the development of [[geometric measure theory]], which studies various notions of surface area for irregular objects of any dimension. An important example is the [[Minkowski content]] of a surface.\n\n==Noah gay n==\nWhile the areas of many simple surfaces have been known since antiquity, a rigorous mathematical ''definition'' of area requires a great deal of care.\nThis should provide a function\n\n: <math> S \\mapsto A(S) </math>\n\nwhich assigns a positive [[real number]] to a certain class of [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s that satisfies several natural requirements. The most fundamental property of the surface area is its '''additivity''': ''the area of the whole is the sum of the areas of the parts''. More rigorously, if a surface ''S'' is a union of finitely many pieces ''S''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''S''<sub>''r''</sub> which do not overlap except at their boundaries, then \n: <math> A(S) = A(S_1) + \\cdots + A(S_r). </math>\n\nSurface areas of flat polygonal shapes must agree with their geometrically defined [[area]]. Since surface area is a geometric notion, areas of [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] surfaces must be the same and the area must depend only on the shape of the surface, but not on its position and orientation in space. This means that surface area is invariant under the [[Euclidean group|group of Euclidean motions]]. These properties uniquely characterize surface area for a wide class of geometric surfaces called ''piecewise smooth''. Such surfaces consist of finitely many pieces that can be represented in the [[parametric surface|parametric form]]\n\n: <math> S_D: \\vec{r}=\\vec{r}(u,v), \\quad (u,v)\\in D </math>\n\nwith a [[continuously differentiable]] function <math>\\vec{r}.</math> The area of an individual piece is defined by the formula\n\n: <math> A(S_D) = \\iint_D\\left |\\vec{r}_u\\times\\vec{r}_v\\right | \\, du \\, dv. </math>\n\nThus the area of ''S''<sub>''D''</sub> is obtained by integrating the length of the normal vector <math>\\vec{r}_u\\times\\vec{r}_v</math> to the surface over the appropriate region ''D'' in the parametric ''uv'' plane. The area of the whole surface is then obtained by adding together the areas of the pieces, using additivity of surface area. The main formula can be specialized to different classes of surfaces, giving, in particular, formulas for areas of graphs ''z'' = ''f''(''x'',''y'') and [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]].\n\n[[File:Schwarz-lantern.gif|thumb|[[Schwarz lantern]] with <math>M</math> axial slices and <math>N</math> radial vertices. The limit of the area as <math>M</math> and <math>N</math> tend to infinity doesn't converge. In particular it doesn't converge to the area of the cylinder.]]One of the subtleties of surface area, as compared to [[arc length]] of curves, is that surface area cannot be defined simply as the limit of areas of polyhedral shapes approximating a given smooth surface. It was demonstrated by [[Hermann Schwarz]] that already for the cylinder, different choices of approximating flat surfaces can lead to different limiting values of the area; this example is known as the [[Schwarz lantern]].<ref name=sch1>{{cite web|url=http://fredrickey.info/hm/CalcNotes/schwarz-paradox.pdf|title=Schwarz's Paradox|publisher=|date=|access-date=2017-03-21|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073957/http://fredrickey.info/hm/CalcNotes/schwarz-paradox.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|df=}}</ref><ref name=sch2>{{cite web |url=http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Polya/00494925.di020678.02p0385w.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215152255/http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Polya/00494925.di020678.02p0385w.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVarious approaches to a general definition of surface area were developed in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century by [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]]. While for piecewise smooth surfaces there is a unique natural notion of surface area, if a surface is very irregular, or rough, then it may not be possible to assign an area to it at all. A typical example is given by a surface with spikes spread throughout in a dense fashion. Many surfaces of this type occur in the study of [[fractal]]s. Extensions of the notion of area which partially fulfill its function and may be defined even for very badly irregular surfaces are studied in [[geometric measure theory]]. A specific example of such an extension is the [[Minkowski content]] of the surface.\n\n== Common formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Surface areas of common solids\n|-\n!Shape\n!Equation\n!Variables\n|-\n|[[Cube]]\n|<math> 6s^2 \\, </math>\n|''s'' = side length\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]\n|<math> 2(\\ell w + \\ell h + wh) \\, </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Triangular prism]]\n|<math> bh + l(a + b + c) </math>\n|''b'' = base length of triangle, ''h'' = height of triangle, ''l'' = distance between triangular bases, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' = sides of triangle\n|-\n|All [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]]\n|<math> 2B + Ph \\, </math>\n|''B'' = the area of one base, ''P'' = the perimeter of one base, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Sphere]]\n|<math> 4\\pi r^2 = \\pi d^2\\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''d'' = diameter\n|-\n|[[Spherical lune]]\n|<math> 2r^2\\theta \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''\u03b8'' = [[dihedral angle]]\n|-\n|[[Torus]]\n|<math> (2\\pi r)(2\\pi R) = 4\\pi^2 Rr</math>\n|''r'' = minor radius (radius of the tube), ''R'' = major radius (distance from center of tube to center of torus)\n|-\n|Closed [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]\n|<math> 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh = 2\\pi r(r+h) \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of the circular base, ''h'' = height of the cylinder\n|-\n|Lateral surface area of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]]\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(\\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi rs \\, </math>\n|<math> s = \\sqrt{r^2+h^2} </math><br/>\n''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|Full surface area of a cone\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(r + \\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi r(r + s) \\, </math>\n| ''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|[[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramid]]\n|<math>B + \\frac{PL}{2}</math>\n|''B'' = area of base, ''P'' = perimeter of base, ''L'' = slant height\n|-\n|[[Square pyramid]]\n|<math> b^2 + 2bs = b^2 + 2b\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''b'' = base length, ''s'' = slant height, ''h'' = vertical height\n|-\n|Rectangular pyramid\n|<math> lw + l\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} + w\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Tetrahedron]]\n|<math> \\sqrt{3}a^2 </math>\n|''a'' = side length\n|}\n\n===Ratio of surface areas of a sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height===\n[[Image:Inscribed cone sphere cylinder.svg|thumb|300px|A cone, sphere and cylinder of radius ''r'' and height ''h''.]]\nThe below given formulas can be used to show that the surface area of a [[sphere]] and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same radius and height are in the ratio '''2&nbsp;:&nbsp;3''', as follows.\n\nLet the radius be ''r'' and the height be ''h'' (which is 2''r'' for the sphere).\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{rlll}\n\\text{Sphere surface area}   & = 4 \\pi r^2      &                    & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 2 \\\\\n\\text{Cylinder surface area} & = 2 \\pi r (h + r) & = 2 \\pi r (2r + r) & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 3\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThe discovery of this ratio is credited to [[Archimedes]].<ref>{{cite web|first = Chris|last = Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|access-date = 2007-01-02|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209201723/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|archive-date = 2006-12-09|df = }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In chemistry ==\n[[File:Surface area.svg|thumb|Surface area of particles of different sizes.]]\n{{see also|Accessible surface area}}\nSurface area is important in [[chemical kinetics]]. Increasing the surface area of a substance generally increases the [[reaction rate|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]].  For example, [[iron]] in a fine powder will [[combustion|combust]], while in solid blocks it is stable enough to use in structures. For different applications a minimal or maximal surface area may be desired.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In biology ==\n{{see also|Surface-area-to-volume ratio}}\n[[Image:Mitochondrion 186.jpg|right|thumb|The inner membrane of the [[mitochondrion]] has a large surface area due to infoldings, allowing higher rates of [[cellular respiration]] (electron [[micrograph]]).]]\nThe surface area of an organism is important in several considerations, such as regulation of body temperature and [[digestion]]. Animals use their [[teeth]] to grind food down into smaller particles, increasing the surface area available for digestion. The epithelial tissue lining the digestive tract contains [[microvilli]], greatly increasing the area available for absorption. [[Elephant]]s have large [[ear]]s, allowing them to regulate their own body temperature. In other instances, animals will need to minimize surface area; for example, people will fold their arms over their chest when cold to minimize heat loss.\n\nThe [[surface area to volume ratio]] (SA:V) of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] imposes upper limits on size, as the volume increases much faster than does the surface area, thus limiting the rate at which substances diffuse from the interior across the [[cell membrane]] to interstitial spaces or to other cells. Indeed, representing a cell as an idealized [[sphere]] of radius ''r'', the volume and surface area are, respectively, ''V'' = 4/3 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>3</sup>; ''SA'' = 4 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>2</sup>. The resulting surface area to volume ratio is therefore 3/''r''. Thus, if a cell has a radius of 1 \u03bcm, the SA:V ratio is 3; whereas if the radius of the cell is instead 10 \u03bcm, then the SA:V ratio becomes 0.3. With a cell radius of 100, SA:V ratio is 0.03. Thus, the surface area falls off steeply with increasing volume.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Perimeter length]]\n* [[BET theory]], technique for the measurement of the specific surface area of materials\n* [[Spherical area]]\n* [[Surface integral]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n* {{eom|title=Area|id=A/a013180|author=Yu.D.

Smooth surfaces, such as a [[sphere]], are assigned surface area using their representation as [[parametric surface]]s. This definition of surface area is based on methods of [[infinitesimal]] [[calculus]] and involves [[partial derivative]]s and [[double integration]].\n\nA general definition of surface area was sought by [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] at the turn of the twentieth century. Their work led to the development of [[geometric measure theory]], which studies various notions of surface area for irregular objects of any dimension. An important example is the [[Minkowski content]] of a surface.\n\n==Definition==\nWhile the areas of many simple surfaces have been known since antiquity, a rigorous mathematical ''definition'' of area requires a great deal of care.\nThis should provide a function\n\n: <math> S \\mapsto A(S) </math>\n\nwhich assigns a positive [[real number]] to a certain class of [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s that satisfies several natural requirements. The most fundamental property of the surface area is its '''additivity''': ''the area of the whole is the sum of the areas of the parts''. More rigorously, if a surface ''S'' is a union of finitely many pieces ''S''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''S''<sub>''r''</sub> which do not overlap except at their boundaries, then \n: <math> A(S) = A(S_1) + \\cdots + A(S_r). </math>\n\nSurface areas of flat polygonal shapes must agree with their geometrically defined [[area]]. Since surface area is a geometric notion, areas of [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] surfaces must be the same and the area must depend only on the shape of the surface, but not on its position and orientation in space. This means that surface area is invariant under the [[Euclidean group|group of Euclidean motions]]. These properties uniquely characterize surface area for a wide class of geometric surfaces called ''piecewise smooth''. Such surfaces consist of finitely many pieces that can be represented in the [[parametric surface|parametric form]]\n\n: <math> S_D: \\vec{r}=\\vec{r}(u,v), \\quad (u,v)\\in D </math>\n\nwith a [[continuously differentiable]] function <math>\\vec{r}.</math> The area of an individual piece is defined by the formula\n\n: <math> A(S_D) = \\iint_D\\left |\\vec{r}_u\\times\\vec{r}_v\\right | \\, du \\, dv. </math>\n\nThus the area of ''S''<sub>''D''</sub> is obtained by integrating the length of the normal vector <math>\\vec{r}_u\\times\\vec{r}_v</math> to the surface over the appropriate region ''D'' in the parametric ''uv'' plane. The area of the whole surface is then obtained by adding together the areas of the pieces, using additivity of surface area. The main formula can be specialized to different classes of surfaces, giving, in particular, formulas for areas of graphs ''z'' = ''f''(''x'',''y'') and [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]].\n\n[[File:Schwarz-lantern.gif|thumb|[[Schwarz lantern]] with <math>M</math> axial slices and <math>N</math> radial vertices. The limit of the area as <math>M</math> and <math>N</math> tend to infinity doesn't converge. In particular it doesn't converge to the area of the cylinder.]]One of the subtleties of surface area, as compared to [[arc length]] of curves, is that surface area cannot be defined simply as the limit of areas of polyhedral shapes approximating a given smooth surface. It was demonstrated by [[Hermann Schwarz]] that already for the cylinder, different choices of approximating flat surfaces can lead to different limiting values of the area; this example is known as the [[Schwarz lantern]].<ref name=sch1>{{cite web|url=http://fredrickey.info/hm/CalcNotes/schwarz-paradox.pdf|title=Schwarz's Paradox|publisher=|date=|access-date=2017-03-21|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073957/http://fredrickey.info/hm/CalcNotes/schwarz-paradox.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|df=}}</ref><ref name=sch2>{{cite web |url=http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Polya/00494925.di020678.02p0385w.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215152255/http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Polya/00494925.di020678.02p0385w.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVarious approaches to a general definition of surface area were developed in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century by [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]]. While for piecewise smooth surfaces there is a unique natural notion of surface area, if a surface is very irregular, or rough, then it may not be possible to assign an area to it at all. A typical example is given by a surface with spikes spread throughout in a dense fashion. Many surfaces of this type occur in the study of [[fractal]]s. Extensions of the notion of area which partially fulfill its function and may be defined even for very badly irregular surfaces are studied in [[geometric measure theory]]. A specific example of such an extension is the [[Minkowski content]] of the surface.\n\n== Common formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Surface areas of common solids\n|-\n!Shape\n!Equation\n!Variables\n|-\n|[[Cube]]\n|<math> 6s^2 \\, </math>\n|''s'' = side length\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]\n|<math> 2(\\ell w + \\ell h + wh) \\, </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Triangular prism]]\n|<math> bh + l(a + b + c) </math>\n|''b'' = base length of triangle, ''h'' = height of triangle, ''l'' = distance between triangular bases, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' = sides of triangle\n|-\n|All [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]]\n|<math> 2B + Ph \\, </math>\n|''B'' = the area of one base, ''P'' = the perimeter of one base, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Sphere]]\n|<math> 4\\pi r^2 = \\pi d^2\\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''d'' = diameter\n|-\n|[[Spherical lune]]\n|<math> 2r^2\\theta \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of sphere, ''\u03b8'' = [[dihedral angle]]\n|-\n|[[Torus]]\n|<math> (2\\pi r)(2\\pi R) = 4\\pi^2 Rr</math>\n|''r'' = minor radius (radius of the tube), ''R'' = major radius (distance from center of tube to center of torus)\n|-\n|Closed [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]\n|<math> 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh = 2\\pi r(r+h) \\, </math>\n|''r'' = radius of the circular base, ''h'' = height of the cylinder\n|-\n|Lateral surface area of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]]\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(\\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi rs \\, </math>\n|<math> s = \\sqrt{r^2+h^2} </math><br/>\n''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|Full surface area of a cone\n|<math> \\pi r \\left(r + \\sqrt{r^2+h^2}\\right) = \\pi r(r + s) \\, </math>\n| ''s'' = slant height of the cone,<br/>\n''r'' = radius of the circular base,<br/>\n''h'' = height of the cone\n|-\n|[[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramid]]\n|<math>B + \\frac{PL}{2}</math>\n|''B'' = area of base, ''P'' = perimeter of base, ''L'' = slant height\n|-\n|[[Square pyramid]]\n|<math> b^2 + 2bs = b^2 + 2b\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''b'' = base length, ''s'' = slant height, ''h'' = vertical height\n|-\n|Rectangular pyramid\n|<math> lw + l\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} + w\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^2+h^2} </math>\n|''\u2113'' = length, ''w'' = width, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Tetrahedron]]\n|<math> \\sqrt{3}a^2 </math>\n|''a'' = side length\n|}\n\n===Ratio of surface areas of a sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height===\n[[Image:Inscribed cone sphere cylinder.svg|thumb|300px|A cone, sphere and cylinder of radius ''r'' and height ''h''.]]\nThe below given formulas can be used to show that the surface area of a [[sphere]] and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same radius and height are in the ratio '''2&nbsp;:&nbsp;3''', as follows.\n\nLet the radius be ''r'' and the height be ''h'' (which is 2''r'' for the sphere).\n\n<math>\\begin{array}{rlll}\n\\text{Sphere surface area}   & = 4 \\pi r^2      &                    & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 2 \\\\\n\\text{Cylinder surface area} & = 2 \\pi r (h + r) & = 2 \\pi r (2r + r) & = (2 \\pi r^2) \\times 3\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThe discovery of this ratio is credited to [[Archimedes]].<ref>{{cite web|first = Chris|last = Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|access-date = 2007-01-02|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209201723/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|archive-date = 2006-12-09|df = }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In chemistry ==\n[[File:Surface area.svg|thumb|Surface area of particles of different sizes.]]\n{{see also|Accessible surface area}}\nSurface area is important in [[chemical kinetics]]. Increasing the surface area of a substance generally increases the [[reaction rate|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]].  For example, [[iron]] in a fine powder will [[combustion|combust]], while in solid blocks it is stable enough to use in structures. For different applications a minimal or maximal surface area may be desired.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In biology ==\n{{see also|Surface-area-to-volume ratio}}\n[[Image:Mitochondrion 186.jpg|right|thumb|The inner membrane of the [[mitochondrion]] has a large surface area due to infoldings, allowing higher rates of [[cellular respiration]] (electron [[micrograph]]).]]\nThe surface area of an organism is important in several considerations, such as regulation of body temperature and [[digestion]]. Animals use their [[teeth]] to grind food down into smaller particles, increasing the surface area available for digestion. The epithelial tissue lining the digestive tract contains [[microvilli]], greatly increasing the area available for absorption. [[Elephant]]s have large [[ear]]s, allowing them to regulate their own body temperature. In other instances, animals will need to minimize surface area; for example, people will fold their arms over their chest when cold to minimize heat loss.\n\nThe [[surface area to volume ratio]] (SA:V) of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] imposes upper limits on size, as the volume increases much faster than does the surface area, thus limiting the rate at which substances diffuse from the interior across the [[cell membrane]] to interstitial spaces or to other cells. Indeed, representing a cell as an idealized [[sphere]] of radius ''r'', the volume and surface area are, respectively, ''V'' = 4/3 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>3</sup>; ''SA'' = 4 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>2</sup>. The resulting surface area to volume ratio is therefore 3/''r''. Thus, if a cell has a radius of 1 \u03bcm, the SA:V ratio is 3; whereas if the radius of the cell is instead 10 \u03bcm, then the SA:V ratio becomes 0.3. With a cell radius of 100, SA:V ratio is 0.03. Thus, the surface area falls off steeply with increasing volume.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Perimeter length]]\n* [[BET theory]], technique for the measurement of the specific surface area of materials\n* [[Spherical area]]\n* [[Surface integral]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n* {{eom|title=Area|id=A/a013180|author=Yu.D.

[[United Kingdom|British]], [[United States|American]] and [[Samoa]]n forces loyal to [[Prince Tanu]] were defeated by a superior force of Samoan rebels loyal to [[Mata'afa Iosefo]]. Fighting occurred at the former [[German Empire|German]] plantation of [[Vailele]], [[Samoa]] and was a major engagement of the small [[colonial war|colonial conflict]].<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1899, Samoa was a warzone as it had been previously during the [[First Samoan Civil War]]. As result of [[Malietoa Laupepa]]'s death, Mata'afa Iosefo returned from exile and was elected to power by a council of Samoan [[tribal chief|chiefs]]. In response, the British [[Royal Navy]] and the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] landed forces at [[Apia]] in support of Prince Tanu who was the legitimate heir to the Samoan throne which had already been taken over by the German-backed Mataafa.\n\nThe [[Siege of Apia|first battle]] of the conflict involving the British and Americans was fought at Apia, when the naval forces landed they occupied much of the city, Mataafan forces attacked, so British and American warships in [[Apia Harbour]] began bombarding enemy positions around the city. After the conflict, Mataafaite forces, as they were sometimes called, retreated to the stronghold of Vailele and thus began several American and British expeditions into the dense jungle to find the chief's men.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref>\n\nAt the end of March, a joint expedition of British, American and Samoan forces marched along the coast from Apia towards Vailele. Skirmishes were fought and two villages destroyed as the Samoan rebels retreated. On April 1, the expedition of 26 marines, 88 sailors and 136 Samoans left the coast for an attack on the landward side of Vailele, leaving the protection of naval gunfire support. The [[cruiser]]s {{USS|Philadelphia|C-4|6}}, [[HMS Phoenix (1889)|HMS ''Tauranga'']], {{HMS|Porpoise|1886|6}} and the [[corvette]] {{HMS|Royalist|1883|6}} landed the sailors and marines, ''Royalist'' was sent ahead of the expedition to bombard the two forts guarding Vailele plantation.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Samoan paramount chief Mataafa 1911.jpg|150px|right|thumb|''Mata'afa Iosefo in 1911.'']]\nWhen the landing party approached the plantation, HMS ''Royalist'' ceased her bombardment, and just then the land force, under the command of Royal Navy [[Lieutenant]] [[Angel Hope Freeman]] and American Lieutenant [[Philip Lansdale]], was ambushed by over 800 riflemen hidden all around in the foliage of the jungle. The expedition quickly began returning volleys and the Americans set up a [[M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun|Colt machine gun]]. Mataafan forces first attacked the allied column from the rear and from the left flank. Lieutenant Freeman was killed and beheaded just after fighting began, he was hit by [[sniper]]s hiding among palm and banana trees. The rebels then charged and Lieutenant Landsdale took command. Close quarters combat and skirmishing continued for a while, the rebel Samoans repeatedly attacked the expedition's front line and several of them were killed or wounded. The machine gun jammed after firing only a few shots and as Lieutenant Landsdale attempted to fix the problem, a shot hit him in the thigh and he fell to the ground with his bone shattered. A retreat was sounded, and Landsdale ordered his men to save themselves so the expedition began to fall back which left the lieutenant alone under heavy fire. Refusing to leave his commander, [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] [[John R. Monaghan]], picked up a rifle and with three others, went after Landsdale and when they were carrying him out of action, [[Seaman (rank)|Seaman]] [[Norman Edsall]] was shot and killed.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref>\n\nOnce again, Landsdale ordered his rescuers to flee but they held their ground waiting for reinforcements and were killed by fast approaching Samoan rebels. After the battle, Landsdale and Monaghan were found dead side by side and the expedition retreated to the coast having suffered many casualties which were accounted for the following morning. During the withdrawal, HMS ''Royalist'' resumed fire and bombarded the bush from which the Mataafans were attacking. Samoan rebel forces lost 100 killed or wounded while the expedition's casualties were much lighter in comparison. Of the 56 American sailors and marines at the battle, four were killed and another five were wounded. The British lost three men killed, out of sixty-two men engaged, two others were wounded. Federal Samoan casualties were light if any. They were under American command and most deserted at the sound of the first volley, the remaining were used to reinforce the front line. Later patrols reported finding large pools of blood behind the banana trees, evidence of rebel casualties. Two marine privates, [[Henry L. Hulbert]] and [[Michael Joseph McNally]] received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the fighting.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle was a defeat for the expeditionary forces, they retreated back to Apia and reported their casualties to their commanders who decided to plan for future operations in the area. On April 13, the British frontline was extended just south of Vailele and that day the Matafaans attacked but were repulsed. Another expedition later [[Third Battle of Vailele|fought]] again within Vailele, this time the rebels won again when they withstood a British led attack on the two forts. The engagements occurred near the battlefield where Samoan rebels [[Battle of Vailele (1889)|defeated]] German troops in 1889 during the first civil war on the island. A statue of Ensign Monaghan was erected in [[Spokane, Washington]] to commemorate the young officer's bravery.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref> The official report of Monaghan's death reads; \n:\"''The men were not in sufficient numbers to hold out any longer, and they were forced along by a fire which it was impossible to withstand. Ensign Monaghan did stand. He stood steadfast by his wounded superior and friend - one rifle against many, one brave man against a score .... He knew he was doomed. He could not yield. He died in heroic performance of duty.''\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Mains|first=P.

The expedition quickly began returning volleys and the Americans set up a [[M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun|Colt machine gun]]. Mataafan forces first attacked the allied column from the rear and from the left flank. Lieutenant Freeman was killed and beheaded just after fighting began, he was hit by [[sniper]]s hiding among palm and banana trees. The rebels then charged and Lieutenant Landsdale took command. Close quarters combat and skirmishing continued for a while, the rebel Samoans repeatedly attacked the expedition's front line and several of them were killed or wounded. The machine gun jammed after firing only a few shots and as Lieutenant Landsdale attempted to fix the problem, a shot hit him in the thigh and he fell to the ground with his bone shattered. A retreat was sounded, and Landsdale ordered his men to save themselves so the expedition began to fall back which left the lieutenant alone under heavy fire. Refusing to leave his commander, [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] [[John R. Monaghan]], picked up a rifle and with three others, went after Landsdale and when they were carrying him out of action, [[Seaman (rank)|Seaman]] [[Norman Edsall]] was shot and killed.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref>\n\nOnce again, Landsdale ordered his rescuers to flee but they held their ground waiting for reinforcements and were killed by fast approaching Samoan rebels. After the battle, Landsdale and Monaghan were found dead side by side and the expedition retreated to the coast having suffered many casualties which were accounted for the following morning. During the withdrawal, HMS ''Royalist'' resumed fire and bombarded the bush from which the Mataafans were attacking. Samoan rebel forces lost 100 killed or wounded while the expedition's casualties were much lighter in comparison. Of the 56 American sailors and marines at the battle, four were killed and another five were wounded. The British lost three men killed, out of sixty-two men engaged, two others were wounded. Federal Samoan casualties were light if any. They were under American command and most deserted at the sound of the first volley, the remaining were used to reinforce the front line. Later patrols reported finding large pools of blood behind the banana trees, evidence of rebel casualties. Two marine privates, [[Henry L. Hulbert]] and [[Michael Joseph McNally]] received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the fighting.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle was a defeat for the expeditionary forces, they retreated back to Apia and reported their casualties to their commanders who decided to plan for future operations in the area. On April 13, the British frontline was extended just south of Vailele and that day the Matafaans attacked but were repulsed. Another expedition later [[Third Battle of Vailele|fought]] again within Vailele, this time the rebels won again when they withstood a British led attack on the two forts. The engagements occurred near the battlefield where Samoan rebels [[Battle of Vailele (1889)|defeated]] German troops in 1889 during the first civil war on the island. A statue of Ensign Monaghan was erected in [[Spokane, Washington]] to commemorate the young officer's bravery.<ref>Mains, pg. 24</ref> The official report of Monaghan's death reads; \n:\"''The men were not in sufficient numbers to hold out any longer, and they were forced along by a fire which it was impossible to withstand. Ensign Monaghan did stand. He stood steadfast by his wounded superior and friend - one rifle against many, one brave man against a score .... He knew he was doomed. He could not yield. He died in heroic performance of duty.''\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Mains|first=P.
