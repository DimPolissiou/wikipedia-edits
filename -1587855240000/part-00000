Released by [[Memphis Industries]] on 2 February 2018, the album combines elements of [[alternative rock]] and [[chamber pop]], and includes a wider range of musical instruments than previous Field Music albums, predominantly featuring flutes, horns, and string instruments. The band attempted to create a unique instrumental combination for each song; Field Music's David and Peter Brewis felt more confident about expanding the range of instruments on the album, after having made a film soundtrack with an orchestra just before the recording of ''Open Here'' began.\n\n''Open Here'' is more overtly political in its themes than Field Music's previous albums, with many of the songs inspired by David and Peter Brewis' frustration with the result of the [[Brexit]] [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum vote]]. Songs like \"Goodbye to the Country\" and \"Count It Up\", the latter of which focuses on societal privileges enjoyed by white members of the [[Middle class|middle-]] and [[Upper class|upper-class]], directly address Brexit; David Brewis described them as \"definitely the angriest songs I have ever written\". Other songs were inspired by David and Peter Brewis' children and the responsibilities of parenting, including \"No King No Princess\", which speaks out against social conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]].\n\nDespite occasionally serious or cynical topics, Field Music attempted to infuse a sense of optimism and fun within ''Open Here''; the opening track \"Time in Joy\", in particular, was described by Peter Brewis as an effort to confront difficult times \"with a deliberate sense of fun\". ''Open Here'' was the last of five consecutive albums Field Music recorded at their home studio in [[Sunderland]], which was to be demolished shortly after the album was completed. Field Music involved a large number of guest musicians in recording the album, including saxophonist Pete Fraser, trumpeter Simon Dennis, flutist Sarah Hayes, and singer Liz Corney of The Cornshed Sisters, as well as the band's usual string quartet.\n\n\"Count It Up\" was the first single from ''Open Here'', and a music video was released for the song. Additional singles included \"Time in Joy\" and \"Share a Pillow\". The album received positive reviews, and appeared on several year-end lists of the best albums of 2018. Several reviewers compared ''Open Here'' to the work of such artists as [[David Bowie]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[XTC]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:FieldMusic.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Peter Brewis of the rock band Field Music performing on a stage, playing a guitar and singing into a microphone, as other musicians perform in the darkened background behind him.|Peter Brewis, one half of the rock band [[Field Music]], which also includes his brother David.]]\n''Open Here'' is the sixth studio album by [[Field Music]],<ref name=\"Horn0202\">{{cite news |last=Horn |first=Olivia |title=Field Music \u2013 Open Here |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=2 February 2018 |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/field-music-open-here/ |accessdate=25 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627120251/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/field-music-open-here/ |archive-date=27 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> the English rock band consisting of the brothers [[David Brewis|David]] and Peter Brewis.<ref name=\"Waite0131\">{{cite news |last=Waite |first=Kelsey J. |title=The 28 most-anticipated albums of February |work=[[The A.V.

Although Field Music has included these instruments in past works, they were used to a much larger extent in ''Open Here'' than in previous albums.<ref name=\"Sendra0202\" /> Between work on ''Commontime'' and ''Open Here'', Field Music collaborated with the band Warm Digits and the Northern Symphonia to make the soundtrack for the film ''Asunder'' as part of the [[14\u201318 NOW]] series of events to commemorate the [[First World War centenary|centenary of World War&nbsp;I]].

For example, \"Time in Joy\" predominantly features a flute and guitar, \"Count It Up\" uses a keyboard and drum machine, and \"No King No Princess\" utilizes guitars and brass instruments. The final song, \"Find a Way to Keep Me\", includes all of the instruments featured throughout the album, so that it would, according to Peter, \"be the link between all these songs\".<ref

Released by [[Memphis Industries]] on 2 February 2018, the album combines elements of [[alternative rock]] and [[chamber pop]], and includes a wider range of musical instruments than previous Field Music albums, predominantly featuring flutes, horns, and string instruments. The band attempted to create a unique instrumental combination for each song; Field Music's David and Peter Brewis felt more confident about expanding the range of instruments on the album, after having made a film soundtrack with an orchestra just before the recording of ''Open Here'' began.\n\n''Open Here'' is more overtly political in its themes than Field Music's previous albums, with many of the songs inspired by David and Peter Brewis' frustration with the result of the [[Brexit]] [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum vote]]. Songs like \"Goodbye to the Country\" and \"Count It Up\", the latter of which focuses on societal privileges enjoyed by white members of the [[Middle class|middle-]] and [[Upper class|upper-class]], directly address Brexit; David Brewis described them as \"definitely the angriest songs I have ever written\". Other songs were inspired by David and Peter Brewis' children and the responsibilities of parenting, including \"No King No Princess\", which speaks out against social conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]].\n\nDespite occasionally serious or cynical topics, Field Music attempted to infuse a sense of optimism and fun within ''Open Here''; the opening track \"Time in Joy\", in particular, was described by Peter Brewis as an effort to confront difficult times \"with a deliberate sense of fun\". ''Open Here'' was the last of five consecutive albums Field Music recorded at their home studio in [[Sunderland]], which was to be demolished shortly after the album was completed. Field Music involved a large number of guest musicians in recording the album, including saxophonist Pete Fraser, trumpeter Simon Dennis, flutist Sarah Hayes, and singer Liz Corney of The Cornshed Sisters, as well as the band's usual string quartet.\n\n\"Count It Up\" was the first single from ''Open Here'', and a music video was released for the song. Additional singles included \"Time in Joy\" and \"Share a Pillow\". The album received positive reviews, and appeared on several year-end lists of the best albums of 2018. Several reviewers compared ''Open Here'' to the work of such artists as [[David Bowie]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[XTC]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:FieldMusic.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Peter Brewis of the rock band Field Music performing on a stage, playing a guitar and singing into a microphone, as other musicians perform in the darkened background behind him.|Peter Brewis, one half of the rock band [[Field Music]], which also includes his brother David.]]\n''Open Here'' is the sixth studio album by [[Field Music]],<ref name=\"Horn0202\">{{cite news |last=Horn |first=Olivia |title=Field Music \u2013 Open Here |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=2 February 2018 |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/field-music-open-here/ |accessdate=25 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627120251/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/field-music-open-here/ |archive-date=27 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> the English rock band consisting of the brothers [[David Brewis|David]] and Peter Brewis.<ref name=\"Waite0131\">{{cite news |last=Waite |first=Kelsey J. |title=The 28 most-anticipated albums of February |work=[[The A.V.

Although Field Music has included these instruments in past works, they were used to a much larger extent in ''Open Here'' than in previous albums.<ref name=\"Sendra0202\" /> Between work on ''Commontime'' and ''Open Here'', Field Music collaborated with the band Warm Digits and the Northern Symphonia to make the soundtrack for the film ''Asunder'' as part of the [[14\u201318 NOW]] series of events to commemorate the [[First World War centenary|centenary of World War&nbsp;I]].

For example, \"Time in Joy\" predominantly features a flute and guitar, \"Count It Up\" uses a keyboard and drum machine, and \"No King No Princess\" utilizes guitars and brass instruments. The final song, \"Find a Way to Keep Me\", includes all of the instruments featured throughout the album, so that it would, according to Peter, \"be the link between all these songs\".<ref

Phaedra's name derives from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|phaidros}}), which meant \"bright\".\n[[File:Alexandre Cabanel Ph\u00e8dre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Phaedra'' (1880) by [[Alexandre Cabanel]]]]\n\n== Family ==\nPhaedra was the daughter of [[Minos]] and [[Pasipha\u00eb]] of [[Crete]], and thus sister to [[Acacallis (mythology)|Acacallis]], [[Ariadne]], [[Androgeus (son of Minos)|Androgeus]], [[Deucalion (Cretan)|Deucalion]], [[Xenodice (mythology)|Xenodice]], [[Glaucus (son of Minos)|Glaucus]] and [[Catreus]] and half-sister to the [[Minotaur]]. She was the wife of [[Theseus]] and the mother of [[Demophon of Athens]] and [[Acamas (son of Theseus)|Acamas]].\n\n== Mythology ==\nMarried to Theseus, who had kidnapped her after abandoning her sister Ariadne (Ariadne had fallen in love with Theseus and therefore helped him survive the Minotaur by providing him a sword), Phaedra fell in love with [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]], Theseus's son by another woman (born to either [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], or [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], her sister). Hippolytus rejected her.\n\nIn revenge, Phaedra wrote Theseus a letter that claimed Hippolytus had raped her. Theseus got angry and cursed Hippolytus with one of the three curses he had received from [[Poseidon]].<ref>''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 274.</ref> As a result, Hippolytus's horses were frightened by a sea monster and dragged their rider to his death.\n\nIn another version, after Phaedra told Theseus that Hippolytus had raped her, Theseus killed his son, and Phaedra then committed suicide out of guilt, for she had not intended Hippolytus to die. [[Artemis]] later told Theseus the truth. \n\nIn a third version, Phaedra told Theseus and did not kill herself; [[Dionysus]] then sent a wild bull which terrified Hippolytus's horses.\n\n[[Euripides]] twice placed this story  on the Athenian stage, of which one version survives. \n\nAccording to some sources, Hippolytus had spurned [[Aphrodite]] to remain a steadfast and virginal devotee of Artemis, and Aphrodite made Phaedra fall in love with him as a punishment.<ref>The Athenians maintained a small shrine high on the south slope of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] devoted to Aphrodite 'for Hippolytus' (Karl Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959:243).</ref> \n\nIn one version, Phaedra's nurse told Hippolytus of her love, and he swore he would not reveal her as a source of information.\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n[[File:Phaedra-Color.jpg|thumb|Phaedra with an attendant, probably her nurse, a fresco from [[Pompeii]], 60\u201320 BC]]\nPhaedra has been the subject of many notable works in art, literature, music and film.\n\n===In art===\n\n* Phaedra with attendant, probably her nurse, a [[fresco]] from [[Pompeii]] circa 60\u201320 BC\n* Second century Roman Sarcophagus of [[Beatrice of Lorraine]] in the [[Camposanto Monumentale di Pisa|Camposanto]] in [[Pisa]].

For example, [[hygiene]] promotion is seen by some as an integral part of sanitation. For this reason, the [[Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council]] defines sanitation as \"The collection, transport, treatment and disposal or [[Reuse of excreta|reuse of human excreta]], domestic wastewater and solid waste, and associated hygiene promotion.\"<ref>Evans, B., van der Voorden, C., Peal, A.

It encompasses too the re-use and ultimate disposal of human excreta. The term '''environmental sanitation''' is used to cover the wider concept of controlling all the factors in the physical environment which may have deleterious impacts on human health and well-being.

Put in other words: \"Ecosan systems safely recycle excreta resources (plant nutrients and organic matter) to crop production in such a way that the use of non-renewable resources is minimised\". When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe, economical, and closed-loop system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land. Ecosan is also called resource-oriented sanitation.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Emergency pit lining kits by Evenproducts (6619616945).jpg|thumb|Emergency pit lining kits by Evenproducts]]\n\n=== Emergency sanitation ===\n{{Main|Emergency sanitation}}\nEmergency sanitation is required in situations including natural disasters and relief for [[refugee]]s and [[Internally displaced person|Internally Displaced Persons]] (IDPs).<ref name=\"Harveybook\">{{cite book|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/359|title=Excreta disposal in emergencies a field manual: an inter-agency publication|date=2007|publisher=Loughborough university.

The short term phase might also involve technologies such as [[urine-diverting dry toilets]], [[septic tank]]s, [[decentralized wastewater system]]s. Providing [[Hand washing|handwashing]] facilities and [[Fecal sludge management|management of fecal sludge]] are also part of emergency sanitation. The [[Sphere Project]] handbook provides protection principles and core standards for sanitation to put in place after a disaster or conflict.\n\n=== Environmental sanitation ===\nEnvironmental sanitation encompasses the control of environmental factors that are connected to [[disease transmission]]. Subsets of this category are solid waste management, water and [[wastewater]] treatment, [[industrial waste]] treatment and noise pollution control.\n\n=== Improved and unimproved sanitation ===\n{{Main|Improved sanitation}}\n[[Improved sanitation]] and [[unimproved sanitation]] refers to the management of human feces at the household level. This terminology is the indicator used to describe the target of the [[Millennium Development Goal]] on sanitation, by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]] [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].\n\n=== Lack of sanitation ===\nLack of sanitation refers to the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually [[open defecation]] (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mara|first=Duncan|date=2017-03-01|title=The elimination of open defecation and its adverse health effects: a moral imperative for governments and development professionals|journal=Journal of Water Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.2166/washdev.2017.027|issn=2043-9083}}</ref> It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked [[improved sanitation]] facilities as of 2015.<ref name=\"sanitation\">WHO and UNICEF ''[http://www.washdata.org/reports Progress on Sanitation and Drinking-water: 2015 Update]'', WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York</ref>\n\n=== Onsite sanitation ===\n\nOnsite sanitation (or on-site sanitation) is defined as \"a sanitation system in which excreta and wastewater are collected and stored or treated on the plot where they are generated\".<ref name=\"tilley\">{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=L\u00fcthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbr\u00fcgg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland|year = 2014}}</ref>{{rp|173}} The degree of treatment may be variable, from none to advanced. Examples are pit [[latrine]]s (no treatment) and [[septic tank]]s ([[primary treatment]] of wastewater). On-site sanitation systems are often connected to [[fecal sludge management]] systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated at an offsite location. Wastewater ([[sewage]]) is only generated when piped [[water supply]] is available within the buildings or close to them.\n\nA related term is a [[decentralized wastewater system]] which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an [[onsite sewage facility]] can treat the wastewater generated locally.\n\n===Safely managed sanitation===\n\nA relatively high level of sanitation service is now called \"safely managed sanitation\" by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]] definition. This is basic sanitation service where in addition excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite.<ref name=\"JMP2017\"/>\n\n=== Sustainable sanitation ===\n{{Main|Sustainable sanitation}}\n[[Sustainable sanitation]] considers the entire \"sanitation value chain\", from the experience of the user, [[Human excreta|excreta]] and [[wastewater]] collection methods, transportation or conveyance of waste, treatment, and reuse or disposal.<ref name=\"Tilley\"/> The term is widely used since about 2009. In 2007 the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] defined five sustainability criteria to compare the sustainability of sanitation systems. In order to be sustainable, a sanitation system has to be economically viable, socially acceptable, technically and institutionally appropriate, and it should also protect the environment and the natural resources.<ref name=\":2\">SuSanA (2008). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/267 Towards more sustainable sanitation solutions ]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)</ref>\n\n===Other===\nOther terms used to describe certain types of sanitation include:\n* Community-based sanitation (often related to [[decentralized wastewater system|decentralized wastewater treatment]] or DEWATS)\n\n== Types (other) ==\n\n=== Wastewater management ===\n{{Main|Wastewater|Wastewater treatment}}\n[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]].]]\nWastewater management consists of collection, [[wastewater treatment]] (be it municipal or [[industrial wastewater]]), disposal or reuse of treated wastewater. The latter is also referred to as [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]].\n\nSanitation systems in urban areas of developed countries usually consist of the collection of [[wastewater]] in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] for [[reuse]] or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. \n\nIn [[developing countries]] most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. Alternatives to centralized sewer systems include [[onsite sanitation]],  [[decentralized wastewater system]]s, [[dry toilet]]s connected to [[fecal sludge management]].\n\n=== Stormwater drainage ===\n{{Main|Storm drain}}\nSewers are either combined with [[storm drain]]s or separated from them as [[sanitary sewer]]s. [[Combined sewer]]s are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy [[stormwater|rainfall]] and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s, i.e., more or less diluted raw [[sewage]] being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.<ref>''Environmental [[Biotechnology]]: Advancement in Water And Wastewater Application'', edited by Z. Ujang, IWA Proceedings, [[Malaysia]] (2003)</ref>\n\n===Solid waste disposal===\n{{Main|Waste management}}\n[[File:Israel hiriya.jpg|thumb|[[Hiriya|Hiriya Landfill]], [[Israel]].]]\nDisposal of [[solid waste]] is most commonly conducted in [[landfill]]s, but incineration, [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing and conversion to [[biofuel]]s are also avenues.  In the case of landfills, [[advanced countries]] typically have rigid protocols for [[daily cover]] with topsoil, where [[underdeveloped countries]] customarily rely upon less stringent protocols.<ref>[[George Tchobanoglous]] and [[Frank Kreith]] ''Handbook of Solid Waste Management'', McGraw Hill (2002)</ref>  The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of [[pathogen]]s. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of [[leachate]] that could contaminate [[groundwater]] (and hence jeopardize some [[drinking water]] supplies).\n\nFor incineration options, the release of [[air pollutant]]s, including certain [[toxic]] components is an attendant adverse outcome.  Recycling and biofuel conversion are the [[sustainable]] options that generally have superior lifecycle costs, particularly when total [[ecological]] consequences are considered.<ref>William D. Robinson, ''The Solid Waste [[Handbook]]: A Practical Guide'', John Wiley and sons (1986)</ref> Composting value will ultimately be limited by the market demand for compost product.\n\n===Food safety===\n[[File:Canteen kitchen.jpg|thumb|Modern [[restaurant]] food preparation area.]]\n{{Main|food safety}}\nSanitation within the food industry means the adequate treatment of food-contact surfaces by a process that is effective in destroying vegetative cells of [[microorganism]]s of [[public health]] significance, and in substantially reducing numbers of other undesirable microorganisms, but without adversely affecting the food or its safety for the consumer ([[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], [[Code of Federal Regulations]], 21CFR110, USA).  [[Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures]] are mandatory for food industries in [[United States]]. Similarly, in Japan, food hygiene has to be achieved through compliance with food sanitation law.<ref name=\"fslj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/market/regulations/pdf/food-e.pdf|title=Food Sanitation Law in Japan|last=[[Japan External Trade Organization]]|authorlink=|date=|website=|publisher=|doi=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409155125/http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/market/regulations/pdf/food-e.pdf|archivedate=9 April 2008|accessdate=1 March 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn the food and [[biopharmaceutical]] industries, the term \"sanitary equipment\" means equipment that is fully cleanable using [[clean-in-place]] (CIP) and sterilization-in-place (SIP) procedures: that is fully drainable from cleaning solutions and other [[liquid]]s. The design should have a minimum amount of deadleg, or areas where the [[turbulence]] during cleaning is insufficient to remove product deposits.<ref>[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JFEGA4000127000001000124000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes Treatment of deadleg plumbing areas]</ref> In general, to improve cleanability, this equipment is made from [[Stainless Steel]] 316L, (an [[alloy]] containing small amounts of [[molybdenum]]).

Lack of proper sanitation causes diseases. Most of the diseases resulting from sanitation have a direct relation to poverty. The lack of clean water and poor sanitation causes many diseases and the spread of diseases. It is estimated that inadequate sanitation is responsible for 4.0 percent of deaths and 5.7 percent of disease burden worldwide.<ref>Pr\u00fcss A, Kay D, Fewtrell L, Bartram J (2002) [http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/global/en/ArticleEHP052002.pdf \"Estimating the burden of disease from water, sanitation, and hygiene at a global level\".] ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' 110: 537\u201342.</ref>\n\nLack of sanitation is a serious issue that is affecting most developing countries and countries in transition. The importance of the isolation of excreta and waste lies in an effort to prevent diseases which can be [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] through human waste, which afflict both [[developed countries]] as well as [[developing countries]] to differing degrees.\n\nThis situation presents substantial public health risks as the waste could contaminate [[drinking water]] and cause life-threatening forms of [[diarrhea]] to infants.

With regards to samples of [[soil]], [[sewage sludge]], [[biosolids]] or fecal matter from [[dry toilet]]s, [[helminth]] eggs are a commonly used indicator. With helminth egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs.

For example, [[hygiene]] promotion is seen by some as an integral part of sanitation. For this reason, the [[Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council]] defines sanitation as \"The collection, transport, treatment and disposal or [[Reuse of excreta|reuse of human excreta]], domestic wastewater and solid waste, and associated hygiene promotion.\"<ref>Evans, B., van der Voorden, C., Peal, A.

Put in other words: \"Ecosan systems safely recycle excreta resources (plant nutrients and organic matter) to crop production in such a way that the use of non-renewable resources is minimised\". When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe, economical, and closed-loop system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land. Ecosan is also called resource-oriented sanitation.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Emergency pit lining kits by Evenproducts (6619616945).jpg|thumb|Emergency pit lining kits by Evenproducts]]\n\n=== Emergency sanitation ===\n{{Main|Emergency sanitation}}\nEmergency sanitation is required in situations including natural disasters and relief for [[refugee]]s and [[Internally displaced person|Internally Displaced Persons]] (IDPs).<ref name=\"Harveybook\">{{cite book|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/359|title=Excreta disposal in emergencies a field manual: an inter-agency publication|date=2007|publisher=Loughborough university.

The short term phase might also involve technologies such as [[urine-diverting dry toilets]], [[septic tank]]s, [[decentralized wastewater system]]s. Providing [[Hand washing|handwashing]] facilities and [[Fecal sludge management|management of fecal sludge]] are also part of emergency sanitation. The [[Sphere Project]] handbook provides protection principles and core standards for sanitation to put in place after a disaster or conflict.\n\n=== Environmental sanitation ===\nEnvironmental sanitation encompasses the control of environmental factors that are connected to [[disease transmission]]. Subsets of this category are solid waste management, water and [[wastewater]] treatment, [[industrial waste]] treatment and noise pollution control.\n\n=== Improved and unimproved sanitation ===\n{{Main|Improved sanitation}}\n[[Improved sanitation]] and [[unimproved sanitation]] refers to the management of human feces at the household level. This terminology is the indicator used to describe the target of the [[Millennium Development Goal]] on sanitation, by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]] [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].\n\n=== Lack of sanitation ===\nLack of sanitation refers to the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually [[open defecation]] (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mara|first=Duncan|date=2017-03-01|title=The elimination of open defecation and its adverse health effects: a moral imperative for governments and development professionals|journal=Journal of Water Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.2166/washdev.2017.027|issn=2043-9083}}</ref> It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked [[improved sanitation]] facilities as of 2015.<ref name=\"sanitation\">WHO and UNICEF ''[http://www.washdata.org/reports Progress on Sanitation and Drinking-water: 2015 Update]'', WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York</ref>\n\n=== Onsite sanitation ===\n\nOnsite sanitation (or on-site sanitation) is defined as \"a sanitation system in which excreta and wastewater are collected and stored or treated on the plot where they are generated\".<ref name=\"tilley\">{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=L\u00fcthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbr\u00fcgg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland|year = 2014}}</ref>{{rp|173}} The degree of treatment may be variable, from none to advanced. Examples are pit [[latrine]]s (no treatment) and [[septic tank]]s ([[primary treatment]] of wastewater). On-site sanitation systems are often connected to [[fecal sludge management]] systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated at an offsite location. Wastewater ([[sewage]]) is only generated when piped [[water supply]] is available within the buildings or close to them.\n\nA related term is a [[decentralized wastewater system]] which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an [[onsite sewage facility]] can treat the wastewater generated locally.\n\n===Safely managed sanitation===\n\nA relatively high level of sanitation service is now called \"safely managed sanitation\" by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]] definition. This is basic sanitation service where in addition excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite.<ref name=\"JMP2017\"/>\n\n=== Sustainable sanitation ===\n{{Main|Sustainable sanitation}}\n[[Sustainable sanitation]] considers the entire \"sanitation value chain\", from the experience of the user, [[Human excreta|excreta]] and [[wastewater]] collection methods, transportation or conveyance of waste, treatment, and reuse or disposal.<ref name=\"Tilley\"/> The term is widely used since about 2009. In 2007 the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] defined five sustainability criteria to compare the sustainability of sanitation systems. In order to be sustainable, a sanitation system has to be economically viable, socially acceptable, technically and institutionally appropriate, and it should also protect the environment and the natural resources.<ref name=\":2\">SuSanA (2008).

Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)</ref>\n\n===Other===\nOther terms used to describe certain types of sanitation include:\n* Community-based sanitation (often related to [[decentralized wastewater system|decentralized wastewater treatment]] or DEWATS)\n\n== Types (other) ==\n\n=== Wastewater management ===\n{{Main|Wastewater|Wastewater treatment}}\n[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]].]]\nWastewater management consists of collection, [[wastewater treatment]] (be it municipal or [[industrial wastewater]]), disposal or reuse of treated wastewater. The latter is also referred to as [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]].\n\nSanitation systems in urban areas of developed countries usually consist of the collection of [[wastewater]] in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] for [[reuse]] or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. \n\nIn [[developing countries]] most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. Alternatives to centralized sewer systems include [[onsite sanitation]],  [[decentralized wastewater system]]s, [[dry toilet]]s connected to [[fecal sludge management]].\n\n=== Stormwater drainage ===\n{{Main|Storm drain}}\nSewers are either combined with [[storm drain]]s or separated from them as [[sanitary sewer]]s. [[Combined sewer]]s are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy [[stormwater|rainfall]] and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s, i.e., more or less diluted raw [[sewage]] being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.<ref>''Environmental [[Biotechnology]]: Advancement in Water And Wastewater Application'', edited by Z.

In the case of landfills, [[advanced countries]] typically have rigid protocols for [[daily cover]] with topsoil, where [[underdeveloped countries]] customarily rely upon less stringent protocols.<ref>[[George Tchobanoglous]] and [[Frank Kreith]] ''Handbook of Solid Waste Management'', McGraw Hill (2002)</ref>  The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of [[pathogen]]s. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of [[leachate]] that could contaminate [[groundwater]] (and hence jeopardize some [[drinking water]] supplies).\n\nFor incineration options, the release of [[air pollutant]]s, including certain [[toxic]] components is an attendant adverse outcome.  Recycling and biofuel conversion are the [[sustainable]] options that generally have superior lifecycle costs, particularly when total [[ecological]] consequences are considered.<ref>William D.

Lack of proper sanitation causes diseases. Most of the diseases resulting from sanitation have a direct relation to poverty.

The specific goal for the year 2015 was to reduce by half the number of people who had no access to [[drinking water|potable water]] and sanitation in the baseline year of 1990. As the JMP and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) Human Development Report in 2006 has shown, progress meeting the MDG sanitation target is slow, with a large gap between the target coverage and the current reality.\n\nThere are numerous reasons for this gap. A major one is that sanitation is rarely given political attention received by other topics despite its key importance. Sanitation is not high on the international development agenda, and projects such as those relating to [[water supply]] projects are emphasised.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] (JMP) has been publishing reports of updated estimates every two years on the use of various types of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities at the national, regional and global levels. The JMP report for 2015 stated that:<ref name=\"sanitation\" />\n\n* Between 1990 and 2015, [[open defecation]] rates have decreased from 38% to 25% globally.
