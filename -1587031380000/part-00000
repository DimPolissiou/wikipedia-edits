The first goal in the new building was scored by Jack Laviolette of Montreal, and won by Montreal 4\u20133. The game was marred by a match penalty to Newsy Lalonde for hitting Joe Hall in the head, opening a cut requiring eight stitches. On the return match at Montreal on January 14, Mr. Hall would charge Lalonde into the boards for a ten stitch wound.\n\nThe longest team winning streak was seven by Ottawa.\n\nIn the latter half of the season, the league banned checking into the boards.

A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |title=Stanley Cup Contest May Not Be for the Mug, After all, is said |date=March 18, 1914 |page=8}}</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the series was accepted.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 |page=}}</ref>\n\nSeveral days later, trustee William Foran wrote to NHA president Emmett Quinn that the trustees are \"perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto World\n |title=Three Pro Leagues as to Stanley Cup |date=March 25, 1914 |page=8|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZKIkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2CcDAAAAIBAJ&hl=fr&pg=3341%2C944185}}</ref>\n\nTotal attendance for the series was 14,260 for an average of 4,753 in the 7,500 capacity Arena.

The first goal in the new building was scored by Jack Laviolette of Montreal, and won by Montreal 4\u20133. The game was marred by a match penalty to Newsy Lalonde for hitting Joe Hall in the head, opening a cut requiring eight stitches. On the return match at Montreal on January 14, Mr. Hall would charge Lalonde into the boards for a ten stitch wound.\n\nThe longest team winning streak was seven by Ottawa.\n\nIn the latter half of the season, the league banned checking into the boards. The rule was adopted permanently at a league meeting after the season.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |location=Toronto |title=Pro Hockey Leagues Do Away With Fines |page=12 |date=March 31, 1914}}</ref>\n\n===Final standings===\n\n{{1913\u201314 NHA standings}}\n\n==Playoffs==\n\nTied at the top of the standings, the Blue shirts and Canadiens faced off in a two-game, total goals series to determine a league champion and holder of the Stanley Cup.

Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Blueshirts met March 7 in Montreal and March 11 in Toronto to determine the NHA Champion and new Stanley Cup Champion. The challenge series against Sydney Millionaires was cancelled.\n\nAfter dispatching the Canadiens, the Blue Shirts faced off against the [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |title=Stanley Cup Contest May Not Be for the Mug, After all, is said |date=March 18, 1914 |page=8}}</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the series was accepted.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 |page=}}</ref>\n\nSeveral days later, trustee William Foran wrote to NHA president Emmett Quinn that the trustees are \"perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto World\n |title=Three Pro Leagues as to Stanley Cup |date=March 25, 1914 |page=8|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZKIkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2CcDAAAAIBAJ&hl=fr&pg=3341%2C944185}}</ref>\n\nTotal attendance for the series was 14,260 for an average of 4,753 in the 7,500 capacity Arena.

{"title_page": "Ostrogoths", "text_new": "[[File:Tomb of Theodoric the Great Ravenna (cropped).jpg|thumb|Upright=1.1|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]] in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]]]\nThe '''Ostrogoths''' ({{lang-la|Ostrogothi, Austrogothi}}) were a [[Roman-era]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]]. In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]].\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] after the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] became preeminent, and began to form their kingdom within the Roman Balkans. Eventually, the Emperor [[Zeno]] backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]] there as its king, under imperial authority. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\n==The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi==\nAccording to historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] the first record of a distinctive Gothic group, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first mentioned only one hundred years later in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways. The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5]].

Note Wolfram describes this as a poem to 392, though as Christensen and Cameron et al. note, it was written after the death of [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{citation|title=Claudian's In Eutropium: Or, How, When, and Why to Slander a Eunuch |first=Jacqueline |last=Long |year=1996 |chapter=5 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=E-U6CwAAQBAJ}}.}} It is generally believed by historians that this Phrygian settlement of Greuthingi, referred to as including Ostrogoths, were part of the Greuthungi-led force led by [[Odotheus]] in 386, and not the Greuthungi who had entered the empire earlier, in 376 under Alatheus and Saphrax.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heather |first=Peter |title=The Anti-Scythian Tirade of Synesius' \"De Regno\"| journal=Phoenix| volume= 42 |issue=2 |year=1988| page=156|doi=10.2307/1088231 |url=www.jstor.org/stable/1088231}}</ref> In contrast, the [[Amal dynasty]], around whom the later and better-known Othogothic kingdom formed, were in neither of these groups, because into the 5th century they were Gothic leaders within [[Attila]] [[Hunnic empire]].\n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic Amal dynasty, there is a tradition of simply equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the more reliable contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pp=141\u2013157}} summarizes the field's position: \"There has never been any doubt that of these two conflicting accounts, the one by Ammianus Marcellinus was to be referred\". Christensen especially cites {{cite journal|title=Cassiodorus and the Rise of the Amals: Genealogy and the Goths under Hun Domination |first= Peter last=Heather |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |volume=79 |year=1989 |pages=103\u2013128 |doi=10.2307/301183 |url=www.jstor.org/stable/301183}}.}}\n\nAccording to Jordanes' ''Getica'' (XVI), around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244\u2013249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths. Modern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such Herwig Wolfram believe that he was right to believe there was a continuity between the nobility of the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nWolfram claims the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greuthungi or Vesi/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} When all four names were used together, the pairing was always preserved, as in the example of Claudian, or the [[Augustan History]] for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202-203}} Wolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were geographical identifiers used by each tribe to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} Historian Thomas Burns agrees with this conclusion.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}} This terminology therefore dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}}\n\nIn general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\", however, was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (tou Oualemeriakou) by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source. See: [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/39 p.39].}} In the 6th century, however, Jordanes believed that the Visigoths and Ostrogoths were two contrasting names simply meaning western and eastern Goths, respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=206}}\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Gothic language}}\nWhile none of the eastern Germanic languages are still spoken, Gothic is the only one with \"continuous texts\" remaining. Singularly the most important work amid the surviving Gothic texts is the translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]], comprising the earliest remnants of the Germanic languages known.{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Smatterings of the Gothic language can be found in Italian but its presence is minimal. A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\n\nMentioned in several sources up to the third century AD when they apparently split into at least two groups, the [[Greuthungs|Greuthungi]] in the east and [[Thervings|Tervingi]] in the west, the two [[Goths|Gothic]] tribes shared many aspects, especially recognizing a patron deity the Romans named [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. This so-called \"split\" or, more appropriately, resettlement of western tribes into the Roman province of [[Dacia]] was a natural result of population saturation of the area north of the Black Sea. The Goths in Dacia established a vast and powerful kingdom during the third and fourth centuries between the [[Danube]] and the [[Dniepr]] in what is now [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and western [[Ukraine]]. This was a multi-tribal state ruled by a Gothic elite but inhabited by many other interrelated but multi-tongue tribes including the Iranian-speaking [[Sarmatians]], the Germanic-speaking [[Gepids]], the Thracian-speaking [[Dacians]], other minor [[Celt]]ic and [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes and possibly early [[Slavs]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434454/Ostrogoth ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''\u2014Ostrogoths]</ref> Unfortunately the exact geographical dividing line between the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths is not known but in general terms, the Visigoths occupied Dacia, Moldavia and Walachia, whereas the Ostrogoths lived in the steppe regions beyond the [[Dniester River]], ruling over a large confederation of Germanic and [[Scythian]] tribes, covering a vast territory in what is now Ukraine and areas of southern Russia. [[Jordanes]] calls the realm Oium, or Aujum.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions===\nThe rise of the [[Huns]] around 370 overwhelmed the Gothic kingdoms.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Many of the Goths migrated into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]], while others remained north of the [[Danube]] under Hunnic rule. Frequently the Ostrogoths fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} It was the Ostrogoths who were first subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}} Like other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451. Several uprisings against the Huns were suppressed. The collapse of Hunnic power in the 450s led to further violent upheaval in the lands north of the Danube, during which the Ostrogoths expanded slowly southwards into the Balkans, and then westwards towards [[Illyria]] and the borders of Italy. Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\n===Post-Hunnic movements===\nTheir recorded history begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. Now allied with the Huns' former vassals, the Gepids, the Ostrogoths under [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] broke the Hunnic power of Attila's sons in the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, although the Ostrogoth contribution to the battle's success was minimal.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=52}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths now entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} During the greater part of the latter half of the 5th century, the East Goths played in south-eastern Europe nearly the same part that the Western Goths (Visigoths) played in the century before. They were seen going to and from, in every conceivable relation of friendship and enmity with the Eastern Roman power, until, just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West. Unchallenged by the now-dissipated power of the Huns, the Ostrogoths under [[Valamir]] were themselves powerful and absorbed elements from other, smaller tribes, such as the [[Scirii]]. A dispute with the Eastern Roman emperor at Constantinople caused Valamir to lead his Ostrogoths against him. With the barbarians at the gates, Emperor Leo I agreed to pay an annual subsidy of gold.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib. II., XLI. Luduin regi Francorum Theodericus rex}} was born to Theodemir in or about 454, soon after the Battle of Nedao. His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion.

The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania.

Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|De Bello Gothico IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==Ostrogothic rulers==\n===Amal dynasty===\n* [[Valamir]]  r. 447 &ndash; c. 465 \n* [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] r. c. 465 &ndash; 475\n* [[Theodoric the Great]]  r. 475\u2013526 \n* [[Athalaric]] r. 526\u2013534\n* [[Amalasuntha]], r. 534-535\n* [[Theodahad]] r. 535\u2013536\n\n===Later kings===\n* [[Witiges]] r. 536\u2013540\n* [[Ildibad]] r. 540\u2013541\n* [[Eraric]] r. 541\n* [[Totila]] (also ''Baduila'') r. 541\u2013552  \n* [[Teia|Theia]] (also ''Teia(s)'', ''Teja'')  r. 552\u2013553\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]\n* [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]]\n* [[Chernyakhov culture]]\n* [[Oium]]\n* [[Wielbark culture]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* [[Patrick Amory|Amory, Patrick]].

In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]].\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] after the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] became preeminent, and began to form their kingdom within the Roman Balkans. Eventually, the Emperor [[Zeno]] backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]] there as its king, under imperial authority. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\n==The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi==\nAccording to historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] the first record of a distinctive Gothic group, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first mentioned only one hundred years later in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways. The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5]].

Modern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such Herwig Wolfram believe that he was right to believe there was a continuity between the nobility of the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nWolfram claims the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greuthungi or Vesi/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} When all four names were used together, the pairing was always preserved, as in the example of Claudian, or the [[Augustan History]] for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202-203}} Wolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were geographical identifiers used by each tribe to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} Historian Thomas Burns agrees with this conclusion.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}} This terminology therefore dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}}\n\nIn general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\", however, was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (tou Oualemeriakou) by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern.

A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\n\nMentioned in several sources up to the third century AD when they apparently split into at least two groups, the [[Greuthungs|Greuthungi]] in the east and [[Thervings|Tervingi]] in the west, the two [[Goths|Gothic]] tribes shared many aspects, especially recognizing a patron deity the Romans named [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. This so-called \"split\" or, more appropriately, resettlement of western tribes into the Roman province of [[Dacia]] was a natural result of population saturation of the area north of the Black Sea. The Goths in Dacia established a vast and powerful kingdom during the third and fourth centuries between the [[Danube]] and the [[Dniepr]] in what is now [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and western [[Ukraine]]. This was a multi-tribal state ruled by a Gothic elite but inhabited by many other interrelated but multi-tongue tribes including the Iranian-speaking [[Sarmatians]], the Germanic-speaking [[Gepids]], the Thracian-speaking [[Dacians]], other minor [[Celt]]ic and [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes and possibly early [[Slavs]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434454/Ostrogoth ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''\u2014Ostrogoths]</ref> Unfortunately the exact geographical dividing line between the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths is not known but in general terms, the Visigoths occupied Dacia, Moldavia and Walachia, whereas the Ostrogoths lived in the steppe regions beyond the [[Dniester River]], ruling over a large confederation of Germanic and [[Scythian]] tribes, covering a vast territory in what is now Ukraine and areas of southern Russia. [[Jordanes]] calls the realm Oium, or Aujum.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions===\nThe rise of the [[Huns]] around 370 overwhelmed the Gothic kingdoms.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Many of the Goths migrated into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]], while others remained north of the [[Danube]] under Hunnic rule. Frequently the Ostrogoths fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} It was the Ostrogoths who were first subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}} Like other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451. Several uprisings against the Huns were suppressed. The collapse of Hunnic power in the 450s led to further violent upheaval in the lands north of the Danube, during which the Ostrogoths expanded slowly southwards into the Balkans, and then westwards towards [[Illyria]] and the borders of Italy. Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\n===Post-Hunnic movements===\nTheir recorded history begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. Now allied with the Huns' former vassals, the Gepids, the Ostrogoths under [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] broke the Hunnic power of Attila's sons in the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, although the Ostrogoth contribution to the battle's success was minimal.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=52}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths now entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} During the greater part of the latter half of the 5th century, the East Goths played in south-eastern Europe nearly the same part that the Western Goths (Visigoths) played in the century before. They were seen going to and from, in every conceivable relation of friendship and enmity with the Eastern Roman power, until, just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West. Unchallenged by the now-dissipated power of the Huns, the Ostrogoths under [[Valamir]] were themselves powerful and absorbed elements from other, smaller tribes, such as the [[Scirii]]. A dispute with the Eastern Roman emperor at Constantinople caused Valamir to lead his Ostrogoths against him. With the barbarians at the gates, Emperor Leo I agreed to pay an annual subsidy of gold.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib. II., XLI. Luduin regi Francorum Theodericus rex}} was born to Theodemir in or about 454, soon after the Battle of Nedao. His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]].

The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania. Theodoric's grandson [[Athalaric]] took on the mantle as king of the Ostrogoths for the next five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=334}} [[Provence]] was added to the dominion of the new Ostrogothic king Athalaric and through his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] who was named regent.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} Both were unable to settle disputes among Gothic elites.

Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|De Bello Gothico IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]].

Thus, at the end of the story, Indra learns how to pursue wisdom while still fulfilling his kingly duties.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Iconography===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Tiruchchirappalli painting Indra (cropped).jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Indradeva.jpg\n| width2 = 220\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Indra's iconography shows him holding a [[thunderbolt]] or [[Vajra]] and a sword.
