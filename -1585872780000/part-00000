An influential member of the [[African National Congress]] in the 1960s and 1970s, he was inaugurated as South Africa's National [[Poet Laureate]] in 2006.<ref>Victor Dlamini, [http://victordlamini.bookslive.co.za/blog/2008/08/12/podcast-with-poet-laureate-keorapetse-kgositsile/ Podcast with Poet Laureate Keorapetse Kgositsile], Books Live, 12 August 2008.</ref> Kgositsile lived in exile in the United States from 1962 until 1975, the peak of his literary career. He made an extensive study of [[African-American]] literature and culture, becoming particularly interested in jazz. During the 1970s he was a central figure among African-American poets, encouraging interest in Africa as well as the practice of poetry as a performance art; he was well known for his readings in New York City jazz clubs. Kgositsile was one of the first to bridge the gap between African poetry and Black poetry in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n\nKgositsile was born in a mostly white section of [[Johannesburg]], and grew up in a small shack at the back of a house in a white neighborhood that was rented by his mother.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> His first experience of [[apartheid]], other than having to go to school outside of his neighborhood for reasons he did not then understand, was a conflict with a local white family after he fought a white friend of his who hesitated when other friends refused to join a boxing club that denied Kgositsile membership.<ref>Rowell, Charles H., \"\u2018With Bloodstains to Testify\u2019: An Interview with Keorapetse Kgositsile\", ''Callaloo'', issue 2, 1978, p. 23.</ref> The experience was a formative one, and joined with other experiences of exclusion that increased throughout his teenage years. For Kgositsile, adulthood meant an entrance into apartheid.<ref>Rowell, p. 24.</ref>\n\nKgositsile attended [[Madibane High School]] in Johannesburg, as well as schools in other parts of the country. During that time he was able (with some difficulty) to find books by [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], and influenced by them as well as by European writers (principally [[Charles Dickens]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]), he began writing stories, though not yet with any intention of doing so professionally.<ref>Rowell, p. 27.</ref> After working at a series of odd jobs after high school, he took to writing more seriously, getting a job with the politically charged newspaper ''[[New Age (South African newspaper)|New Age]]''. He contributed both reporting and poetry to the newspaper. These early poems, anticipating a lifetime of Kgositsile's work, combine [[Lyric poetry|lyricism]] with an unmuted call to arms, as in these lines from \"Dawn\":\n:Remember in baton boot and bullet ritual<br>The bloodhounds of Monster [[B.J. Vorster|Vorster]] wrote<br>[[Soweto|SOWETO]] over the belly of my land<br>with the indelible blood of infants<br>So the young are no longer young<br>Not that they demand a hasty death<ref>\"Dawn\", ''New Age'' Vol. 9, No. 2, 15 [http://disa.nu.ac.za/articledisplaypage.asp?articletitle=New+Age&filename=Dav9n285] .  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035357/http://disa.nu.ac.za/articledisplaypage.asp?articletitle=New%20Age&filename=Dav9n285 |date= 4 February 2012 }}</ref>\nAny early interest in fiction was replaced by the sheer urgency of communication that Kgositsile felt. As he said later, \"In a situation of oppression, there are no choices beyond didactic writing: either you are a tool of oppression or an instrument of liberation.\"<ref>Quoted in {{cite journal|doi=10.1215/03335372-22-2-365 |author=Bethlehem, Louise|title=\"A Primary Need as Strong as Hunger\": The Rhetoric of Urgency in South African Literary Culture under Apartheid|year=2001|journal=Poetics Today|volume=22|issue=2|pages=365\u2013389}}</ref>\n\n==The years of exile==\nIn 1961, under considerable pressure both for himself and as part of a government effort to shut down ''New Age'', Kgositile was urged by the African National Congress, of which he was a vocal member, to leave the country. He went initially to [[Dar es Salaam]] to write for ''Spearhead'' magazine (unrelated to the [[Spearhead (magazine)|right-wing British magazine]] of the same name),<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9045234 \"Keorapetse Kgositsile\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. Last Updated 21 July 2013.</ref> but the following year emigrated to the United States. He studied at a series of universities, beginning with [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where he \"spent a lot of time in the library trying to read as much black literature as I could lay my hands on.\"<ref>Rowell, 28.</ref>\n\nAfter studying at the [[University of New Hampshire]] and [[The New School for Social Research]], Kgositsile entered the [[Master of Fine Arts]] program in creative writing at [[Columbia University]]. At the same time, he published his first collection of poems, ''Spirits Unchained''. The collection was well received, and he was given a [[Harlem Cultural Council]] Poetry Award and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Poetry Award. He graduated from Columbia in 1971, and remained in New York, teaching and giving his characteristically dynamic readings in downtown clubs and as part of the [[Uptown Black Arts Movement]].<ref name=\"Snyder\">Snyder, Greg, [http://www.newschool.edu/tcds/twenone.htm \"Life's Truth Aesthetically Interpreted: Greg Snyder Talks With Keorapetse Kgositsile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908201210/http://www.newschool.edu/tcds/twenone.htm |date=8 September 2005 }}. New School for Social Research, ''Bulletin # 21'', Vol. 6, no. 2, 1995.</ref> Kgositsile's most influential collection, ''My Name is Afrika'', was published in that year. The response, including an introduction to the book by [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], established Kgositsile as a leading African-American poet. [[The Last Poets]], a group of revolutionary African-American poets, took their name from one of his poems.\n\n=== Influence of jazz and the black aesthetic ===\n\nJazz was particularly important to Kgositsile's sense of black American culture and his own place in it. He saw [[John Coltrane]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[B. B. King]], and many others in the jazz clubs of New York, and wrote to them and of them in his poems. Jazz was crucial to Kgositsile's most influential idea: his sense of a worldwide African diaspora united by an ear for a certain quintessentially black sound. He wrote of the black aesthetic he pursued and celebrated:\n:There is nothing like art\u2014in the oppressor's sense of art. There is only movement. Force. Creative power. The walk of [[Sophiatown]] [[tsotsi]] or my Harlem brother on [[Lenox Avenue]]. [[field holler|Field Hollers]]. [[The Blues]]. A [[John Coltrane|Trane]] riff. [[Marvin Gaye]] or [[mbaqanga]]. Anguished happiness. Creative power, in whatever form it is released, moves like the dancer's muscles.<ref>Quoted in {{cite journal|author=Ro, Sigmund|title=\"Desercrators\" and \"Necromancers\": Black American Writers and Critics in the Nineteen-Sixties and the Third World Perspective|journal=Callaloo|issue=25|year=1985|pages=563\u2013576 (560)|doi=10.2307/2930827|jstor=2930827}}</ref>\nFreedom from a constricting white aesthetic sensibility and the discovery of the rhythmic experience common to black people of all the world were, for Kgositsile, two sides of the same struggle.\n\n=== Black theatre===\n\nKgositsile also became active in theater while in New York, founding the [[Black Arts Theatre]] in Harlem. He saw black theater as a fundamentally revolutionary activity, whose ambition must be the destruction of the ingrained habits of thought responsible for perceptions of black people both by white people and by themselves. He wrote:\n:We will be destroying the symbols which have facilitated our captivity. We will be creating and establishing symbols to facilitate our necessary and constant beginning.<ref>\"Towards our Theatre: A Definitive Act,\" quoted in {{cite journal|jstor=3041431|author=Brown, Lloyd W.|title=The Cultural Revolution in Black Theatre|journal=Negro American Literature Forum|volume=8|issue=1|year=1974|pages=159\u2013165 (161)|doi=10.2307/3041431}}</ref>\nThe Black Arts Theatre was part of a larger project aimed at the creation of literary black voice unafraid to be militant. Kgositsile argued persistently against the idea of [[N\u00e9gritude]], a purely aesthetic conception of black culture, on the grounds that it was dependent on white aesthetic models of perception, a process he called \"fornicating with the white eye.\"<ref>\"Paths to the Future,\" quoted in {{cite journal|title=Cesaire at Seventy|journal=Callaloo|issue=17 |year=1983|pages=111\u2013119 (118)|jstor=3044017|author=Arnold, A. James|doi=10.2307/3044017}}</ref> This work took place while Kgositsile was teaching at Columbia in the earlier 1970s; he left to work briefly at ''[[Black Dialogue Magazine]].''\n\n== Return to Africa ==\n\nIn 1975, Kgositsile decided to return to Africa, despite his blossoming career in the United States, and took up a teaching position at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]], in [[Tanzania]]. In 1978, he married another ANC exile, [[Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile|Baleka Mbete]], who was also living in Tanzania. Still from exile, he renewed his activities with the ANC, founding its Department of Education in 1977 and its Department of Arts and Culture in 1983; he became Deputy Secretary in 1987.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> Kgositsile taught at several schools in different parts of Africa, including [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Zambia]]. Throughout this period he was banned in South Africa, but in 1990 the [[Congress of South African Writers]] (COSAW), with which he was already associated, decided to attempt a publication within the country. The successful result was ''When the Clouds Clear'', a collection of poems from other volumes, which was Kgositsile's first book to be available in his native country.\n\n===\"Your destination remains / Elusive\"===\nIn July 1990, after 29 years in exile, Kgositsile returned to South Africa. He arrived in a country wholly different from the one he had left, transformed by the beginning of the end of apartheid and the release and later the political triumph of [[Nelson Mandela]]. In 1990, however, it was still a place of great confusion, particularly for the many exiled black writers, artists, and intellectuals pouring into the country. In a 1991 essay, \"Crossing Borders Without Leaving\", Kgostitsile describes his first trip back to Johannesburg, where he was sponsored by COSAW: \"Here are my colleagues and ''hosts''. Can you deal with that?  Hosts!  In my own country.\" But it is not his country anymore: \"there are no memories here. The streets of Johannesburg cannot claim me. I cannot claim them either.\"<ref>Kgositsile, \"Crossing Borders Without Leaving\", ''[[Staffrider]]'', Vol. 4, No. 2 (1991, 5\u201310), 6.</ref> Still, he returned to the country as a kind of hero to young black writers and activists:\n:Usually, when we met, there would be a little amused giggle or mischievous grin from them as we shook hands and hugged or kissed, depending on the gender. When I would want to find out what the joke was so that we could share it if I also found it funny, one or several of them would recite some of my work, complete with the sound of my voice to the degree that had I heard the recitation without seeing who was reciting, I would probably have said, \"Wonder when I recorded that.\"<ref>\"Crossing Borders\" 10.</ref>\nDespite that sense of distance from the country, he dove immediately back into politics and cultural activism, and was quick to say that less had changed than should have: \"there is the reality,\" he said in a 1992 interview, \"that the South Africa that alienated black people to a very large extent still exists.\"<ref>[[Achmat Dangor|Dangor, Achmat]], Interview with Keorapetse Kgositsile, 20 February 1992, in Kevin Goddard and Charles Wessels (eds), ''Out of Exile: South African Writers Speak'', Grahamstown: National English Literary Museum, 1992, p. 81.</ref> Kgositsile was quick to criticize black leaders as well as white for this status quo, accusing the ANC of \"being criminally backward when it comes to questions of culture and its place in society or struggle.\"<ref>Dangor, p. 84.</ref>  In the early 1990s he served as vice president of COSAW, fostering the careers of young writers while continuing his steady critique of South African politics.\n\nKgositsile's most recent poems are more conversational and perhaps less lyrical than his earlier work, and, compared to his once-fiery nationalism, they are muted, and even skeptical. They speak of doubt rather than certainty, a doubt often reinforced by rhythmical understatement, as in the short, uneven lines of \"Recollections\":\n:Though you remain<br>Convinced<br>To be alive<br>You must have somewhere<br>To go<br>Your destination remains<br>Elusive.<!--<nowiki><ref>''If I Could Sing'' p.?</ref></nowiki>-->\n\nIn 2009 Bra Willie was part of the ''Beyond Words'' UK tour<ref>[http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2009/10/26/keorapetse-kgositsile-lebo-mashile-don-mattera-and-phillippa-yaa-de-villiers-to-tour-the-uk/ \"Keorapetse Kgositsile, Lebo Mashile, Don Mattera and Phillippa Yaa de Villiers to Tour the UK\"], Books Live, 26 October 2009.</ref> that also featured South African poets [[Don Mattera]], [[Lesego Rampolokeng]], [[Phillippa Yaa de Villiers]] and [[Lebo Mashile]] (presented by [[Apples & Snakes]] in association with [[Sustained Theatre]], funded by the [[British Council]] South Africa, [[Arts Council England]] and the South African government).<ref>[http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/beyond-words \"Beyond Words: New South African Poetry\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218044603/http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/beyond-words |date=18 December 2014 }}, Sustained Theatre.</ref><ref>[http://www.applesandsnakes.org/page/41/BEYOND+WORDS/129?archive=true \"Beyond Words \u2013 Overview\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218042443/http://www.applesandsnakes.org/page/41/BEYOND+WORDS/129?archive=true |date=18 December 2014 }}, Apples & Snakes.</ref><ref>[http://www.thesouthafrican.com/sa%E2%80%99s-top-poets-to-perform-in-london/ \"SA\u2019s top poets to perform in London\"], TheSouthAfrican.com, 2 November 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/?location_id=44 \"Vibrancy & Urgency \u2013 New South African Poetry\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218043531/http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/?location_id=44 |date=18 December 2014 }}, Sustained Theatre.</ref>\n\nIn 2013 he was elected as Director of Culture Department and one of the first Executive Committee Members of [[SACPFA|SA-China People's Friendship Association]].\n\nKgositsile returned to the United States several times, including for a visiting professorship at the New School.

An influential member of the [[African National Congress]] in the 1960s and 1970s, he was inaugurated as South Africa's National [[Poet Laureate]] in 2006.<ref>Victor Dlamini, [http://victordlamini.bookslive.co.za/blog/2008/08/12/podcast-with-poet-laureate-keorapetse-kgositsile/ Podcast with Poet Laureate Keorapetse Kgositsile], Books Live, 12 August 2008.</ref> Kgositsile lived in exile in the United States from 1962 until 1975, the peak of his literary career. He made an extensive study of [[African-American]] literature and culture, becoming particularly interested in jazz. During the 1970s he was a central figure among African-American poets, encouraging interest in Africa as well as the practice of poetry as a performance art; he was well known for his readings in New York City jazz clubs. Kgositsile was one of the first to bridge the gap between African poetry and Black poetry in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n\nKgositsile was born in a mostly white section of [[Johannesburg]], and grew up in a small shack at the back of a house in a white neighborhood that was rented by his mother.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> His first experience of [[apartheid]], other than having to go to school outside of his neighborhood for reasons he did not then understand, was a conflict with a local white family after he fought a white friend of his who hesitated when other friends refused to join a boxing club that denied Kgositsile membership.<ref>Rowell, Charles H., \"\u2018With Bloodstains to Testify\u2019: An Interview with Keorapetse Kgositsile\", ''Callaloo'', issue 2, 1978, p. 23.</ref> The experience was a formative one, and joined with other experiences of exclusion that increased throughout his teenage years. For Kgositsile, adulthood meant an entrance into apartheid.<ref>Rowell, p. 24.</ref>\n\nKgositsile attended [[Madibane High School]] in Johannesburg, as well as schools in other parts of the country. During that time he was able (with some difficulty) to find books by [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], and influenced by them as well as by European writers (principally [[Charles Dickens]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]), he began writing stories, though not yet with any intention of doing so professionally.<ref>Rowell, p. 27.</ref> After working at a series of odd jobs after high school, he took to writing more seriously, getting a job with the politically charged newspaper ''[[New Age (South African newspaper)|New Age]]''. He contributed both reporting and poetry to the newspaper. These early poems, anticipating a lifetime of Kgositsile's work, combine [[Lyric poetry|lyricism]] with an unmuted call to arms, as in these lines from \"Dawn\":\n:Remember in baton boot and bullet ritual<br>The bloodhounds of Monster [[B.J. Vorster|Vorster]] wrote<br>[[Soweto|SOWETO]] over the belly of my land<br>with the indelible blood of infants<br>So the young are no longer young<br>Not that they demand a hasty death<ref>\"Dawn\", ''New Age'' Vol. 9, No. 2, 15 [http://disa.nu.ac.za/articledisplaypage.asp?articletitle=New+Age&filename=Dav9n285] .  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035357/http://disa.nu.ac.za/articledisplaypage.asp?articletitle=New%20Age&filename=Dav9n285 |date= 4 February 2012 }}</ref>\nAny early interest in fiction was replaced by the sheer urgency of communication that Kgositsile felt. As he said later, \"In a situation of oppression, there are no choices beyond didactic writing: either you are a tool of oppression or an instrument of liberation.\"<ref>Quoted in {{cite journal|doi=10.1215/03335372-22-2-365 |author=Bethlehem, Louise|title=\"A Primary Need as Strong as Hunger\": The Rhetoric of Urgency in South African Literary Culture under Apartheid|year=2001|journal=Poetics Today|volume=22|issue=2|pages=365\u2013389}}</ref>\n\n==The years of exile==\nIn 1961, under considerable pressure both for himself and as part of a government effort to shut down ''New Age'', Kgositile was urged by the African National Congress, of which he was a vocal member, to leave the country. He went initially to [[Dar es Salaam]] to write for ''Spearhead'' magazine (unrelated to the [[Spearhead (magazine)|right-wing British magazine]] of the same name),<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9045234 \"Keorapetse Kgositsile\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. Last Updated 21 July 2013.</ref> but the following year emigrated to the United States. He studied at a series of universities, beginning with [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where he \"spent a lot of time in the library trying to read as much black literature as I could lay my hands on.\"<ref>Rowell, 28.</ref>\n\nAfter studying at the [[University of New Hampshire]] and [[The New School for Social Research]], Kgositsile entered the [[Master of Fine Arts]] program in creative writing at [[Columbia University]]. At the same time, he published his first collection of poems, ''Spirits Unchained''. The collection was well received, and he was given a [[Harlem Cultural Council]] Poetry Award and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Poetry Award. He graduated from Columbia in 1971, and remained in New York, teaching and giving his characteristically dynamic readings in downtown clubs and as part of the [[Uptown Black Arts Movement]].<ref name=\"Snyder\">Snyder, Greg, [http://www.newschool.edu/tcds/twenone.htm \"Life's Truth Aesthetically Interpreted: Greg Snyder Talks With Keorapetse Kgositsile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908201210/http://www.newschool.edu/tcds/twenone.htm |date=8 September 2005 }}. New School for Social Research, ''Bulletin # 21'', Vol. 6, no. 2, 1995.</ref> Kgositsile's most influential collection, ''My Name is Afrika'', was published in that year. The response, including an introduction to the book by [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], established Kgositsile as a leading African-American poet. [[The Last Poets]], a group of revolutionary African-American poets, took their name from one of his poems.\n\n=== Influence of jazz and the black aesthetic ===\n\nJazz was particularly important to Kgositsile's sense of black American culture and his own place in it. He saw [[John Coltrane]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[B. B. King]], and many others in the jazz clubs of New York, and wrote to them and of them in his poems. Jazz was crucial to Kgositsile's most influential idea: his sense of a worldwide African diaspora united by an ear for a certain quintessentially black sound. He wrote of the black aesthetic he pursued and celebrated:\n:There is nothing like art\u2014in the oppressor's sense of art. There is only movement. Force. Creative power. The walk of [[Sophiatown]] [[tsotsi]] or my Harlem brother on [[Lenox Avenue]]. [[field holler|Field Hollers]]. [[The Blues]]. A [[John Coltrane|Trane]] riff. [[Marvin Gaye]] or [[mbaqanga]]. Anguished happiness. Creative power, in whatever form it is released, moves like the dancer's muscles.<ref>Quoted in {{cite journal|author=Ro, Sigmund|title=\"Desercrators\" and \"Necromancers\": Black American Writers and Critics in the Nineteen-Sixties and the Third World Perspective|journal=Callaloo|issue=25|year=1985|pages=563\u2013576 (560)|doi=10.2307/2930827|jstor=2930827}}</ref>\nFreedom from a constricting white aesthetic sensibility and the discovery of the rhythmic experience common to black people of all the world were, for Kgositsile, two sides of the same struggle.\n\n=== Black theatre===\n\nKgositsile also became active in theater while in New York, founding the [[Black Arts Theatre]] in Harlem. He saw black theater as a fundamentally revolutionary activity, whose ambition must be the destruction of the ingrained habits of thought responsible for perceptions of black people both by white people and by themselves. He wrote:\n:We will be destroying the symbols which have facilitated our captivity. We will be creating and establishing symbols to facilitate our necessary and constant beginning.<ref>\"Towards our Theatre: A Definitive Act,\" quoted in {{cite journal|jstor=3041431|author=Brown, Lloyd W.|title=The Cultural Revolution in Black Theatre|journal=Negro American Literature Forum|volume=8|issue=1|year=1974|pages=159\u2013165 (161)|doi=10.2307/3041431}}</ref>\nThe Black Arts Theatre was part of a larger project aimed at the creation of literary black voice unafraid to be militant. Kgositsile argued persistently against the idea of [[N\u00e9gritude]], a purely aesthetic conception of black culture, on the grounds that it was dependent on white aesthetic models of perception, a process he called \"fornicating with the white eye.\"<ref>\"Paths to the Future,\" quoted in {{cite journal|title=Cesaire at Seventy|journal=Callaloo|issue=17 |year=1983|pages=111\u2013119 (118)|jstor=3044017|author=Arnold, A. James|doi=10.2307/3044017}}</ref> This work took place while Kgositsile was teaching at Columbia in the earlier 1970s; he left to work briefly at ''[[Black Dialogue Magazine]].''\n\n== Return to Africa ==\n\nIn 1975, Kgositsile decided to return to Africa, despite his blossoming career in the United States, and took up a teaching position at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]], in [[Tanzania]]. In 1978, he married another ANC exile, [[Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile|Baleka Mbete]], who was also living in Tanzania. Still from exile, he renewed his activities with the ANC, founding its Department of Education in 1977 and its Department of Arts and Culture in 1983; he became Deputy Secretary in 1987.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> Kgositsile taught at several schools in different parts of Africa, including [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Zambia]]. Throughout this period he was banned in South Africa, but in 1990 the [[Congress of South African Writers]] (COSAW), with which he was already associated, decided to attempt a publication within the country. The successful result was ''When the Clouds Clear'', a collection of poems from other volumes, which was Kgositsile's first book to be available in his native country.\n\n===\"Your destination remains / Elusive\"===\nIn July 1990, after 29 years in exile, Kgositsile returned to South Africa. He arrived in a country wholly different from the one he had left, transformed by the beginning of the end of apartheid and the release and later the political triumph of [[Nelson Mandela]]. In 1990, however, it was still a place of great confusion, particularly for the many exiled black writers, artists, and intellectuals pouring into the country. In a 1991 essay, \"Crossing Borders Without Leaving\", Kgostitsile describes his first trip back to Johannesburg, where he was sponsored by COSAW: \"Here are my colleagues and ''hosts''. Can you deal with that?  Hosts!  In my own country.\" But it is not his country anymore: \"there are no memories here. The streets of Johannesburg cannot claim me. I cannot claim them either.\"<ref>Kgositsile, \"Crossing Borders Without Leaving\", ''[[Staffrider]]'', Vol. 4, No. 2 (1991, 5\u201310), 6.</ref> Still, he returned to the country as a kind of hero to young black writers and activists:\n:Usually, when we met, there would be a little amused giggle or mischievous grin from them as we shook hands and hugged or kissed, depending on the gender. When I would want to find out what the joke was so that we could share it if I also found it funny, one or several of them would recite some of my work, complete with the sound of my voice to the degree that had I heard the recitation without seeing who was reciting, I would probably have said, \"Wonder when I recorded that.\"<ref>\"Crossing Borders\" 10.</ref>\nDespite that sense of distance from the country, he dove immediately back into politics and cultural activism, and was quick to say that less had changed than should have: \"there is the reality,\" he said in a 1992 interview, \"that the South Africa that alienated black people to a very large extent still exists.\"<ref>[[Achmat Dangor|Dangor, Achmat]], Interview with Keorapetse Kgositsile, 20 February 1992, in Kevin Goddard and Charles Wessels (eds), ''Out of Exile: South African Writers Speak'', Grahamstown: National English Literary Museum, 1992, p. 81.</ref> Kgositsile was quick to criticize black leaders as well as white for this status quo, accusing the ANC of \"being criminally backward when it comes to questions of culture and its place in society or struggle.\"<ref>Dangor, p. 84.</ref>  In the early 1990s he served as vice president of COSAW, fostering the careers of young writers while continuing his steady critique of South African politics.\n\nKgositsile's most recent poems are more conversational and perhaps less lyrical than his earlier work, and, compared to his once-fiery nationalism, they are muted, and even skeptical. They speak of doubt rather than certainty, a doubt often reinforced by rhythmical understatement, as in the short, uneven lines of \"Recollections\":\n:Though you remain<br>Convinced<br>To be alive<br>You must have somewhere<br>To go<br>Your destination remains<br>Elusive.<!--<nowiki><ref>''If I Could Sing'' p.?</ref></nowiki>-->\n\nIn 2009 Bra Willie was part of the ''Beyond Words'' UK tour<ref>[http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2009/10/26/keorapetse-kgositsile-lebo-mashile-don-mattera-and-phillippa-yaa-de-villiers-to-tour-the-uk/ \"Keorapetse Kgositsile, Lebo Mashile, Don Mattera and Phillippa Yaa de Villiers to Tour the UK\"], Books Live, 26 October 2009.</ref> that also featured South African poets [[Don Mattera]], [[Lesego Rampolokeng]], [[Phillippa Yaa de Villiers]] and [[Lebo Mashile]] (presented by [[Apples & Snakes]] in association with [[Sustained Theatre]], funded by the [[British Council]] South Africa, [[Arts Council England]] and the South African government).<ref>[http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/beyond-words \"Beyond Words: New South African Poetry\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218044603/http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/beyond-words |date=18 December 2014 }}, Sustained Theatre.</ref><ref>[http://www.applesandsnakes.org/page/41/BEYOND+WORDS/129?archive=true \"Beyond Words \u2013 Overview\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218042443/http://www.applesandsnakes.org/page/41/BEYOND+WORDS/129?archive=true |date=18 December 2014 }}, Apples & Snakes.</ref><ref>[http://www.thesouthafrican.com/sa%E2%80%99s-top-poets-to-perform-in-london/ \"SA\u2019s top poets to perform in London\"], TheSouthAfrican.com, 2 November 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/?location_id=44 \"Vibrancy & Urgency \u2013 New South African Poetry\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218043531/http://www.sustainedtheatre.org/?location_id=44 |date=18 December 2014 }}, Sustained Theatre.</ref>\n\nIn 2013 he was elected as Director of Culture Department and one of the first Executive Committee Members of [[SACPFA|SA-China People's Friendship Association]].\n\nKgositsile returned to the United States several times, including for a visiting professorship at the New School.

Something of a Renaissance man, a leader of an Afrikaans avant-garde, his work was experimental, latterly integrating poetry and art.\n\n==Early life and family background==\nDu Plessis' father Karel Erasmus du Plessis was a teacher at Fouriesburg at the time of Phil's birth on 22 March 1944. The family lived on a farm outside the town and Karel would ride to work on horseback every morning. His Mother, Hester Petronella, n\u00e9e Janse van Rensburg, was a grand niece of Commander General [[Johannes Van Rensburg|Hans van Rensburg]] of the [[Ossewa Brandwag]].\n\nDu Plessis was educated at [[Viljoenskroon, Free State|Viljoenskroon]] and at [[Shannon, Free State|Shannon]] outside [[Bloemfontein, Free State|Bloemfontein]]. He completed his high school career at [[Grey College, Bloemfontein|Grey College]] in Bloemfontein. His parents having relocated to [[Kroonstad, Free State|Kroonstad]], where his father was appointed school inspector, he boarded in Bloemfontein with his violin teacher, [[Victor Pohl]], who was also well known as an adventure writer. Du Plessis matriculated in 1961. His interest in writing had begun whilst he was in Standard 9, in 1958.\n\n==Medical studies and musical career==\n\nDu Plessis enrolled as a medical student at the [[University of Pretoria]] where he qualified as a doctor in 1968.\n\nAlongside his medical studies he continued to receive tuition as a violinist, from [[Alan Solomon]], and played in the orchestra of the Toonkunsakademie as well as in the orchestra of the [[Collegium Musicum, Pretoria|Collegium Musicum]] and in chamber groups in Pretoria. He took part in a number of radio broadcasts. His instrument, from the Tyrolean School of violin makers, dated 1693, was restored by Kotie van Soelen.\n\n==Medical practice==\nFrom 1969 to 1972 Du Plessis practised as medical doctor at [[Stilfontein, North West|Stilfontein]] and Crown Mines, and from 1972 to 1974 at [[Luderitzbucht]] in what was still South West Africa ([[Namibia]]).\n\nThereafter he moved to the Cape and settled at [[Kalk Bay, Cape Town|Kalk Bay]], initially renting but, in 1978, purchasing the historic house Liscard, which he restored in 1983 through the services of architects [[Revel Fox]], John Rennie and Pat Riley. The house was declared a national monument.\n\nHaving worked for a time at [[Valkenberg Hospital]] as a clinical assistant, Du Plessis developed an interest in psychoanalysis; and his general practice at Kalkbay came to be augmented by his role in [[psychiatry]].\n\nNear the end of his life he was in general practice and had his surgery at home. He was well known in the village and treated the residents at the Haven Night Shelter free of charge.\n\n==Poet==\nFrom 1964, when Du Plessis met the young poet [[Wilhelm Knobel]], he began himself to write poetry, joining in a group from 1966 that met monthly to submit and discuss one another's work. His first poems were published in ''Sestiger'', while he was becoming involved in the literary magazines ''Wurm'' and ''Ophir''. His local circle included De Waal Venter, Casper Schmidt and D.P.M. Botha and the poets Peter Horn and Walter Saunders. International correspondents included Netherlanders, Belgians, Englishmen, Czechs and a South American, together with a group of Americans from Greece, who published letters, poems and opinion pieces in ''Wurm''. Working closely with Marie Blomerus, Du Plessis served as editor of ''Wurm'', ''Izwi'' and ''New Nation'', as well as a Flemish periodical, ''Argo''. In the Netherlands and Flanders he worked with the journals ''Yang'', ''Argo'' and ''Labris''. Locally he published literary and musical reviews in all the important Afrikaans papers.\n\nIt was at this period and apparently on account of some of this activity that Du Plessis was held overnight for interrogation by the Security Police at the notorious apartheid-era [[John Vorster Square]] police station in Johannesburg.\n\nFrom 1971 Du Plessis published his work in a succession of anthologies:\n*''Geskrifte on \u2019n houtgesig, 1965\u20131970'' (Tafelberg 1971)\n*''Die diep soet afgeronde stem van my dooies: gedigte 1970\u20131974'' (Tafelberg 1975)\n*''Lyksang: gedigte 1974\u20131980'' (Perskor 1980)\n*''Gebed vir Wilhelm'' (Kalkbaai: Phil du Plessis 1984)\n*''Ek sing waar ek staan = I sing where I stand: po\u00ebsie 1982\u20131984 \u2013 versions from Afrikaans (English translations by [[Patrick Cullinan]])'' (Kalkbaai: Vooraand Uitgewers 1985)<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Liscard Main Road Kalk Bay.jpg|thumb|right|Liscard a National Monument at Kalk Bay]] -->\n*''Ek sing waar ek staan: gedigte 1982\u20131986'' (Tafelberg 1986)\n*''Dae voor winter'' (Tafelberg 1989)\n*''Openbaringe van Johannes'' (Carrefour Press 1992)\n*''Op Koueberg: vrye verwerking van 40 verse deur Han-Sjan'' (Snailpress 1993)\n*''Engel uit die Paradys'' (Hond 1994)\n*''Nagjoernaal: gedigte 1994\u20131996'' (Lindlife 1996)\n*''Herakles van Valsbaai: gedigte 1996\u20131999'' (Kalliope 1999)\n*''Woordweer: gedigte uit die twintigste eeu'' (Protea Boekhuis 2004)\n\nWorking with alternative publishers from the 1990s, he had a greater involvement in the making of each book, in the choice of type and of paper. A significant new element in these later anthologies was the integration of illustrations in collaboration with a range artists: with [[Braam Kruger]] in ''Openbaringe van Johannes''; [[Hugo Slabber]] in ''Engel uit die paradys''; [[Judith Mason]] in ''Nagjoernaal''; [[Jan Visser]] in ''Herakles by Valsbaai''; and [[Gus Ferguson]] in ''Op Koueberg'', in which du Plessis makes translations of Chinese verse. [[Antjie Krog]] referred to the hazards of combining poetry and visual art but felt that \"a perfect unity\" had been achieved particularly in the drawings of Ferguson \"with the clear vivid and playful poetry\" in ''Op Koueberg''. [[Judith Mason]] promised, in a review of ''Openbaringe van Johannes'', that \"for the price of a good cabernet,\" one would be holding in one's hands \"a book which is brutal and charming, outrageous and compassionate, sensual and sore, angry and immeasurably humane. Like the man himself.\u201d\n\n==At home==\n\nDu Plessis hosted legendary Sunday luncheon gatherings at \"Liscard\", his Kalk Bay home. Amongst regular guests at one period were [[Robert Ardrey]] (until his death in 1980) and his actress wife (and widow) Berdine Grunewald, who had retired to nearby [[St James, Cape Town|St James]]. Longer-term guests invited to recuperate from illness under his roof and his care were [[Wopko Jensma]] and [[Sheila Cussons]]. Guests have recalled his playing his violin on Sunday afternoons.\n\nDu Plessis married Catherine Lauga, a lecturer in French at the [[University of Cape Town]]. She is the translator of a number of well-known South-African\nnovelists writing in English, amongst them J.M. Coetzee, Nobel Prize\nLaureate.\n\nHe died on 28 November 2011 after a long battle with various health issues. A very well attended service was held in the Holy Trinity Church Kalk Bay following his death, and his ashes were scattered from a small fishing boat in front of his beloved \"Liscard\". At the service musical tributes were paid to du Plessis by well-known classical musicians, many of whom shared his love of music.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Du Plessis, Phil}}\n[[Category:Writers from Cape Town]]\n[[Category:21st-century South African poets]]\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:2011 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century South African poets]]\n[[Category:South African male poets]]\n[[Category:20th-century South African male writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century South African male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n'''Phil du Plessis''', [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] poet, musician and [[medical doctor]], was born as Johannes du Plessis at [[Fouriesburg, Free State|Fouriesburg]], in the [[Orange Free State|Free State]], South Africa, on 22 March 1944, and died in Cape Town on 28 November 2011.<ref>[http://www.litnet.co.za/Article/phil-du-plessis-19442011-jy-onthou-phil-want-jy-kan-nie-anders-nie Phil du Plessis (1944\u20132011): Jy onthou Phil, want jy k\u00e1n nie anders nie by Amanda Botha]</ref><ref>[http://www.argief.litnet.co.za/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=print_article&news_id=113614&cause_id=1270 Phil du Plessis 1944\u20132011 by Erika Terblanche] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130422002431/http://www.argief.litnet.co.za/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=print_article&news_id=113614&cause_id=1270 |date=22 April 2013 }}</ref> Following the appearance of his first anthology he was hailed by [[Andre Brink]] as the spokesman for an underground 'Sixties' group in Afrikaans poetry.

He is renowned for being one of the foremost gay writers in Afrikaans, his most controversial book being ''Nagsweet'' (\"Night sweat\").\n\n==Writing career==\nHe debuted in 1982 with a collection of poetry titled ''Akwarelle van die dors'' (\"Aquarelles of thirst\") for which he was awarded the Ingrid Jonker prize in 1983.
