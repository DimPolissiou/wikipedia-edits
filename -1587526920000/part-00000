In that interview, Ayyadurai recalled that Les Michelson, the former particle scientist at [[Brookhaven National Labs]] who assigned Ayyadurai the project, had the idea of creating an electronic mail system that uses the header conventions of a hardcopy memorandum. Ayyadurai recalled Michelson as saying: \"Your job is to convert that into an electronic format.

The statement pointed out that Ayyadurai's approach instead \"focused on communications between linked computer terminals in an ordinary office situation\".<ref name=\"SmithsonianStatement\"/> ''The Washington Post'' also followed up with a correction of errors in its earlier report on the Smithsonian acquisition, stating that it incorrectly referred to Ayyadurai as the inventor of electronic messaging; the 'bcc', 'cc', 'to' and 'from' fields existed previously; Ayyadurai had not been honored as the \"inventor of email\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', [[Sam Biddle]] argued that email was developed a decade before EMAIL, beginning with [[Ray Tomlinson]]'s sending the first text letter between two [[ARPANET]]-connected computers in 1971.<ref>i.e. the first ''network'' email using the \"@\" syntax; email between users on the same mainframe was already common.</ref> Biddle quoted Tomlinson: \"[We] had most of the headers needed to deliver the message (to:, cc:, etc.) as well as identifying the sender (from:) and when the message was sent (date:) and what the message was about.\" Biddle allowed for the possibility that Ayyadurai may have coined the term \"EMAIL\" and used the header terms without being aware of earlier work, but maintained that the historical record isn't definitive on either point. Biddle wrote that \"laying claim to the name of a product that's the generic term for a universal technology gives you acres of weasel room.

He said that CSIR scientists reported that \"they work in a [[medieval]], [[feudalism|feudal]] environment\" that required a \"major overhaul\". The letter was co-authored by a colleague, Deepak Sardana. [[Pushpa Mittra Bhargava|Pushpa Bhargava]], founding director of the CSIR's Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, endorsed the letter, calling Ayyadurai's sacking the worst of many cases he had seen of \"vindictiveness in the CSIR\" and accused CSIR administration of being \"impervious to healthy and fair criticism\".

The Judaica special collections are held in the [http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/Judaica/JudaicaSuite Judaica Suite] in [[Library East (Gainesville, Florida)|Smathers Library (East)]].\n\n== History ==\nThe core collection of the Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica was formed from the private collection of Rabbi Leonard C. Mishkin of [[Chicago]], Illinois. At the time of its purchase by the University of Florida in 1977, Mishkin's library was the largest private collection of Judaica and Hebraica in America. This collection covered many different areas of Jewish scholarship in a number of languages but had a particular focus on Jewish periodicals. Mishkin's collection also contained a wide variety of ''[[festschrift]]en'', books produced to honor scholars, usually created by the scholarly community. Mishkin collected ''festschrifts'' of all types, including ones about events, rabbis and leaders, and Jewish community members. He also collected ''Yizkor'' books, which celebrate the anniversary of a persons death. For instance, one of Mishkin's ''Yizkor'' books was about a young Jewish girl on Ellis Island.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jefferson|first=Rebecca|last2=Taylor|first2=Laurie|last3=Santamaria-Wheeler|first3=Lourdes|date=September 17, 2012|title=Digital Dreams: \"The Potential In A Pile of Old Jewish Newspapers\"|journal=Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship|volume=24|issue=3|pages=177\u2013188|doi=10.1080/1941126X.2012.706109}}</ref>\n\nThe Mishkin collection of around 35,000 volumes was purchased in part thanks to a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) Challenge Grant - the first ever awarded to a United States Research Library. This major award was matched by the first State of Florida Quality Improvement Funds.\n\nTwo large collections supplemented and complemented the Mishkin acquisition: Professor Shlomo Marenof's personal collection with its strengths in [[Hebrew]] literature (purchased in 1978), and Bernard Morgenstern's bookstore on New York's [[Lower East Side]] with its copies of major and lesser known [[Yiddish]] works (purchased in 1979). A smaller collection of mostly Ancient [[Near East]]ern works and books on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] was later acquired from [[Theodor Gaster|Theodor H. Gaster's]] private library in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1979, a fund was established to support the development of the Judaica library by Jack and Samuel Price, alumni of the University of Florida. Their gift of $400,000 was the largest single gift ever given to the UF Libraries up to that point, and it was the first time that a special collection in the University Library had been endowed. The Judaica Library was named for their parents, Isser and Rae Price. The library was formally named at a special dedication ceremony in March 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica: History|url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/judaica/libraryhistory.html|work=University of Florida Libraries|publisher=University of Florida Libraries|accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Price Library grew from 45,000 volumes to a collection of over 85,000 thanks to the efforts of its librarian of 30 years, Robert Singerman and his assistants Yael Herbsman, Joy Funk, Carol Bird and Emily Madden. In addition to the \"3 M's Collection\" (Mishkin, Marenof, and Morgenstern), Singerman continued Mishkin's tradition of festschriften, collecting newspapers and periodicals. By his retirement in 2006,  Singerman had collected roughly 200 Jewish newspapers from all over the world, including rare anniversary editions. However, they were unprocessed, stored in binders and boxes with a simple card catalog. After receiving a UF Libraries Mini Grant in 2011, the library worked to digitize its valuable newspaper collection.\n\nInitially located in Library East (Smathers Library) and then in [[Norman Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Norman Hall]] from 1995, the Price Library was finally given a permanent home in Library West in 2006. The Library was rededicated 30 years later in 2011. A special collections wing to house the Judaica Library's special collections was opened in 2014. The [http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/Judaica/JudaicaSuite Judaica Suite] was designed by the renowned Florida architect and artist, [http://holocaustmemorialmiamibeach.org/about/treister_testimonial/ Kenneth Treister, FAIA].\n\nA second historic NEH Challenge Grant was awarded to the George A. Smathers Libraries in 2014 to build an endowment fund that will support the Judaica Library in its efforts to broaden access to Humanities resources relating to the Jewish experience in Florida, Latin America and the Caribbean. The fund will sustain the new online [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/judaica Jewish Diaspora Collection] dedicated to providing global access to materials from these areas.\n\n==The Judaica Suite==\nThis special collections wing opened on January 19, 2014.

The wing is composed of meaningful elements: abstract paintings about creation, a bronze sculpture depicting the parting of the red sea, and quotes from famous Jewish thinkers. Chairs are side by side at tables rather than across from one another, representing the Jewish tradition of studying together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/Judaica/JudaicaSuite|title=The Judaica Suite in Smathers Library, University of Florida}}</ref> Samuel Price and Charles Price made a large contribution for Samuel's son, Todd Carroll Price, which allowed for lights, art, and furniture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Jefferson, R.

The Judaica special collections are held in the [http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/Judaica/JudaicaSuite Judaica Suite] in [[Library East (Gainesville, Florida)|Smathers Library (East)]].\n\n== History ==\nThe core collection of the Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica was formed from the private collection of Rabbi Leonard C. Mishkin of [[Chicago]], Illinois. At the time of its purchase by the University of Florida in 1977, Mishkin's library was the largest private collection of Judaica and Hebraica in America. This collection covered many different areas of Jewish scholarship in a number of languages but had a particular focus on Jewish periodicals. Mishkin's collection also contained a wide variety of ''[[festschrift]]en'', books produced to honor scholars, usually created by the scholarly community. Mishkin collected ''festschrifts'' of all types, including ones about events, rabbis and leaders, and Jewish community members. He also collected ''Yizkor'' books, which celebrate the anniversary of a persons death. For instance, one of Mishkin's ''Yizkor'' books was about a young Jewish girl on Ellis Island.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jefferson|first=Rebecca|last2=Taylor|first2=Laurie|last3=Santamaria-Wheeler|first3=Lourdes|date=September 17, 2012|title=Digital Dreams: \"The Potential In A Pile of Old Jewish Newspapers\"|journal=Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship|volume=24|issue=3|pages=177\u2013188|doi=10.1080/1941126X.2012.706109}}</ref>\n\nThe Mishkin collection of around 35,000 volumes was purchased in part thanks to a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) Challenge Grant - the first ever awarded to a United States Research Library. This major award was matched by the first State of Florida Quality Improvement Funds.\n\nTwo large collections supplemented and complemented the Mishkin acquisition: Professor Shlomo Marenof's personal collection with its strengths in [[Hebrew]] literature (purchased in 1978), and Bernard Morgenstern's bookstore on New York's [[Lower East Side]] with its copies of major and lesser known [[Yiddish]] works (purchased in 1979). A smaller collection of mostly Ancient [[Near East]]ern works and books on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] was later acquired from [[Theodor Gaster|Theodor H. Gaster's]] private library in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1979, a fund was established to support the development of the Judaica library by Jack and Samuel Price, alumni of the University of Florida. Their gift of $400,000 was the largest single gift ever given to the UF Libraries up to that point, and it was the first time that a special collection in the University Library had been endowed. The Judaica Library was named for their parents, Isser and Rae Price. The library was formally named at a special dedication ceremony in March 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica: History|url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/judaica/libraryhistory.html|work=University of Florida Libraries|publisher=University of Florida Libraries|accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Price Library grew from 45,000 volumes to a collection of over 85,000 thanks to the efforts of its librarian of 30 years, Robert Singerman and his assistants Yael Herbsman, Joy Funk, Carol Bird and Emily Madden. In addition to the \"3 M's Collection\" (Mishkin, Marenof, and Morgenstern), Singerman continued Mishkin's tradition of festschriften, collecting newspapers and periodicals. By his retirement in 2006,  Singerman had collected roughly 200 Jewish newspapers from all over the world, including rare anniversary editions. However, they were unprocessed, stored in binders and boxes with a simple card catalog. After receiving a UF Libraries Mini Grant in 2011, the library worked to digitize its valuable newspaper collection.\n\nInitially located in Library East (Smathers Library) and then in [[Norman Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Norman Hall]] from 1995, the Price Library was finally given a permanent home in Library West in 2006. The Library was rededicated 30 years later in 2011. A special collections wing to house the Judaica Library's special collections was opened in 2014. The [http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/Judaica/JudaicaSuite Judaica Suite] was designed by the renowned Florida architect and artist, [http://holocaustmemorialmiamibeach.org/about/treister_testimonial/ Kenneth Treister, FAIA].\n\nA second historic NEH Challenge Grant was awarded to the George A. Smathers Libraries in 2014 to build an endowment fund that will support the Judaica Library in its efforts to broaden access to Humanities resources relating to the Jewish experience in Florida, Latin America and the Caribbean. The fund will sustain the new online [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/judaica Jewish Diaspora Collection] dedicated to providing global access to materials from these areas.\n\n==The Judaica Suite==\nThis special collections wing opened on January 19, 2014.
