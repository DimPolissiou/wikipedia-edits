Howard]] (his first sound film) and stars [[Paul Muni]] (in his film debut), [[Marguerite Churchill]] (in her feature film debut), and [[John Mack Brown]]. Although described by at least one source<ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/V/Valiant1929.html Progressive Silent Film List: ''The Valiant''] at silentera.com</ref> as a [[silent film]] containing talking sequences, synchronized music, and sound effects, ''The Valiant'' has continuous dialogue and is a full \"talkie\" made without a corresponding silent version.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19290918&id=OSksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D7oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3192,3094067&hl=en \"''The Valiant'', Strikingly Original And Tense Drama With Rich Human Appeal\" (''The Florence Times-News'', September 22, 1929, page 4)]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===Surrender of the condemned man===\nThe credits (accompanied by organ music endemic to silent films), segue into title card: \"A city street-----where laughter and tragedy rub elbows.\"  A crowded block lined with [[tenement]] buildings, on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]], comes into view, followed by a look into the hallway of one of those buildings, then a shot is heard, a door to one of the apartments opens and a man holding a gun ([[Paul Muni]]) backs out, closes the door, puts the gun in his pocket, then walks slowly down flights of stairs and into the busy street.\n\nWhile he passes along sidewalks teeming with human activity, an [[Irish American]] policeman (unbilled [[Don Terry]]) berates an arriving driver for parking in front of a hydrant, but when the driver removes his scarf, revealing a priest\u2019s [[clerical collar]], the abashed officer apologizes, ushers him into the car,  and warns him not to park illegally on the [[Beat (police)|beat]] of \"that cop on the next corner, he's not one of us!\u201d The cop steps on the running board and says that he will ride along and help with any traffic. They drive away, leaving the shooter standing on the sidewalk with his hand raised.\n\nContinuing to walk through sidewalks crowded with children, shooter pauses to help a small boy (unbilled [[Delmar Watson]]) who has fallen and skinned his knee. Inside the police precinct, he  approaches  the desk lieutenant (Clifford Dempsey), who asks, \"Well, what's on your mind?\", he replies, \"I killed a man\", explaining that the victim lived at 191 East 8th Street, was named John Harris, and \"deserved to die\".  Asked for his own name, he hesitates and, spotting a wall calendar (showing May 1928) with a large ad for \"Dyke & Co., Inc.\", says \"Dyke... James Dyke\".  To \"Why are you giving yourself up?\", he answers \"It was the only thing to do\". He won\u2019t answer questions about where he was born or where he lives, and a search reveals that any identifying tags have been removed from his clothes.  \n\n===The condemned man is sentenced to be executed===\nThe subsequent title card states: \"Civilization demands its toll.\"  In court, the trial is over and the judge appeals to the killee to think of those others who may be worrying about him. The killer is only willing to say \u201cI never struck anybody in anger in all my life, but when I knew what he had done, I had to kill him.\"  When God\u2019s judgement is mentioned, he goes on to explain that God will judge him truly, because that other man will be there to tell the story that the court has not heard.  God will know the truth. The judge ([[Henry Kolker]]) proclaims, \"it is the duty of this court to sentence you to be executed at the state's prison during the week of August seventeenth and may God have mercy on your soul.\u201d\n\n===The condemned man's mother, sister and sister's fianc\u00e9===\nAnother title card: \"Meanwhile------in a far-away home....\"  In the backyard of a modest old countryside house, a young woman ([[Marguerite Churchill]]) is attending to her collie dogs, while her wheelchair-bound mother ([[Edith Yorke]]) is sitting nearby.  A young man ([[John Mack Brown]]) arrives and greets the mother as \"Mrs. Douglas.\u201d She addresses him as \"Robert\" and tells him that it was on a nice day like this that she last saw her son Joe, and one such s day she always hopes to see him again. Robert hands her \"your [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] paper\" and goes to greet the young woman, \"Mary\", who calls him \"Bob\".  He attempts to help Mary bathe one of the collies, but Laddie slips out of her grasp. When she falls trying to catch the dog, Bob  kisses her long and hard, tells her he loves her and asks if she loves him.  \u201cI thought so\u201d, she replies, and he tells her she will never be sorry. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t be\u201d, she answers. Their mood is somber rather than cheerful. Although they may be referring to a proposal that happened off camera, the conversation and tone suggest that they have been lovers.\n\nMary's mother calls to them and shows them a photograph of \"James Dyke\" in the paper with the headline  \"CRIME DOESN'T PAY / Condemned Man's / Story Of His Life As / It Should Have Been / A LESSON TO YOUTH ON FOLLY OF CRIME / By The Man of Mystery\".  She tells them that he looks like the long-lost Joe, but Mary says that it must be a mistake. \u201cListen to what Bob has to tell you.\u201d Bob asks for Mary\u2019s hand in marriage, and Mary assured her mother that they will all live together afterwards.\n\n===The condemned man arrives at his final destination===\nThe next title card describes \"Gray walls, claiming their forfeits of liberty------and life.\"  Prisoners are seen laboring in a field outside the prison and, as they return to the mess hall for a meal, a stage above the dining area features an orchestra consisting of African-American prisoners playing dance music for the prisoners as they eat.    \n  \n\"Dyke\" has been transferred to this prison to await his execution. He is brought to the office of the warden ([[DeWitt Jennings]]) who asks him about any family members whom he might like to contact, but the condemned man replies that he has no one, no mother or father or sister or wife or sweetheart, and his name is Dyke. Leaving the office, he hears the jaunty melody resonating from the dining area and says, \"I didn't know you had music... here\".    \n\nA newspaper's printing presses are seen churning out the evening edition with the headlines: \"Mystery of Dyke's Identity / Secret as Hour of Death Nears / Prisoner Staunchly Refuses to Divulge / Secret of Himself or the Motive for / His Crime Though He Faces Chair / James Dyke Maintains Silence as He Writes News- / paper Articles Warning Youth on the Folly of Crime\"  One of the pressmen (unbilled [[Robert Homans]]) tells another that he heard the paper was paying Dyke $2,500 for his writings and another (unbilled [[Tom Wilson (actor)|Tom Wilson]]) jokes that Dyke might be buying [[Liberty Bonds]] with the money and adds that he will probably do something with it before he dies ($2,500 in 1929 is worth $36,600 today using the [[Consumer price index|CPI]]\u2014a very conservative measure\u2014or $76,500.00 using the \u201creal\u201d price) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/uscompare/relativevalue.php|title=Measuring Worth|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}.</ref>  \n\n===Seeing the condemned man's photo, his mother insists on traveling to see him===\nSitting in her bedroom, the infirm Mrs. Douglas visualizes old memories of teenage Joe (unbilled [[Barton Hepburn]]) telling his little sister Mary about being cast in a school production of a  [[Shakespeare]] play\u2014Macbeth, judging by his description of the \u201cterrible witches\u201d\u2014and how, at bedtime, instead of \"goodnight\", he taught her to recite to him the \"parting is such sweet sorrow\" lines, while he would respond with \"sleep dwell upon thine eyes...\u201d. Meanwhile, in the living room, Mary and Bob are in the midst of a party to celebrate their engagement and, as the happy couple and invited guests dance, everyone joins in singing a fast chorus of \"Hosanna, hosanna, sing hosanna today\".  Briefly leaving their guests to check on Mrs. Douglas, Mary and Bob hear from her that, despite fragile health, she has decided to make the long trip to visit \"James Dyke\" in prison. The possibility, however tiny, that he might be Joe is making the uncertainty unbearable.  Mary, afraid the trip would kill her mother, offers to travel on her mother's behalf, with Bob accompanying her on the trip. She knows how to make herself known to Joe, if it is he.\n\nAs Mary and Bob sit in a moving train, a middle-aged woman (unbilled Lillian Lawrence) asks inane questions of the conductor while a little girl (unbilled [[Helen Parrish]]) comes over to Mary and Bob, tells them that her name is Suzanne and asks if they also have a little girl, prompting Mary to tell Bob that she couldn't marry him \"if this man in prison should be my brother\", because \"it wouldn't be fair to you\" and \"people are cruel, they would never let you forget. He tells her not to be silly, but she says \u201cThat\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d\n\n===Section of the plot which corresponds to the one-act play on which the film is based===\nA title card reads \"The test of the valiant.\"   Dyke is escorted to the warden, who commends his exemplary behavior and asks what he wants done with the $2,500 in Liberty Bonds which are being held in the office for him.  There must be someone to send them to. Yes there is, but that would give away his identity. Dyke adds that he'll think of something.  Also present is the chaplain ([[Richard Carlyle]]) who, along with the warden, tries to convince him to see the young lady who traveled a thousand miles to speak with him in the hope that he might be her long-lost brother. The distance she has traveled gives Dyke pause and he eventually agrees, but requests privacy for the meeting, which is granted.  The warden speaks with Mary alone, first, learning that she is from the (fictitious) town of Pennington in [[Ohio]]; that her father died when she was a baby; that her brother Joe, who is 10 years older than she, left home 15 years ago because \"he wanted to be in the city\" and has not been heard from since.  She is certain, however, that she could recognize him from his reactions to their long-ago \"goodnight\" exchange of verses from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. She says them aloud for the warden to hear.  \n\nDyke is brought into the office, but there is no sign of recognition.  The warden introduces Mary as \u201cthe young lady who has come all the way from Pennington, Ohio, to see you\u201d; he does not mention her name.  The warden and the chaplain are in one room and the guard in the next, leaving the two alone, but with all doors open.  After Mary's explanation of her reasons for coming, Dyke, who avoids making eye contact with her throughout most of the scene\u2014denies being her brother and does not react to her questioning or to the verses, which he dismisses as silly. When Mary tells him that her mother is ill and will never really get better until she knows what happened to Joe,  Dyke asks Mary what her name is.  Mary Douglas, she replies. Douglas? he asks, thinking aloud, trying to remember. ..Joseph Anthony Douglas. \u201cThat\u2018s Joe\u201d she cries. How...? Dyke tells her that when the [[World War I|War]] began he enlisted and went overseas for four years with the Canadians.\n\nHer eyes never leave his face as he gives an animated description of an act of heroism \u2014 a young soldier showed great valor in risking his life, braving shot and shell to rescue a wounded officer, but dying when a 5.9 landed on them both.  The dead hero's name was Douglas. Joseph Douglas. Joseph Anthony Douglas \u2014 Dyke remembers the name on the dog tags. If an officer had been there there would have been a medal. Many men would have liked to die that way. He tells her to write to Ottawa for the official records. They\u2019ll be able to tell her his battalion and when he went overseas and so forth, although the records are so confused that they might not tell her about his heroism. They might say he was missing or died of wounds or even served out to the end of the war and was honorably discharged: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what happened to half the men.\u201d   \n\nHe asks her to take the unopened envelope (containing the Liberty Bonds) and give it to her mother\u2014a sort of memorial to her son from the man who saw her son die. He asks [[American Gold Star Mothers|that her mother buy a little gold star to wear for her boy]]. He asks Mary to do the same, and wear it over her heart  When she says that she will sometimes think of him, he scoffs at the idea and says that he isn\u2018t fit to be mentioned in the same breath as her brother. Mary asks if there is anything she can do, and he responds that it would mean the world to him if she would say good-bye to him like the sister he never had. After a long, gentle hug, Mary starts to cry, wishing she could have said her special goodnight to her brother one more time. He tells her to say it and she does: \u201cGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow that I should say goodnight \u2018til it be morrow.\u201d\n\nShe runs out sobbing, past the warden and  the chaplain, who gaze at him, speechless. Then \u201cJames Dyke\" tenderly recites, in the presence of the two men,  \u201cSleep dwell upon thine eyes, Peace in thy breast. Would I were Sleep and Peace, so sweet to rest.\u201d  In a long speech, he thanks the warden for letting him see that girl, because he sees how lucky he is to be alone... \u201dIf I had a family,\u201d he says in a warning voice, \u201cit would never be over for them. They would have to go on living and suffering.\u201d The chaplain puts his hand on Dyke\u2019s back and says, in a voice filled with compassion, \u201cMy son. \u201c  \n\nIt is time for the execution. Dyke says, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n===The condemned man's family remembers him as a war hero===  \nBack in Pennington, Mary and Bob sit at the piano, playing \u201c[[Love's Old Sweet Song]]\u201d, and talking of how much better it is now that her mother knows and is so very proud of her \u201chero boy.\u201d Mrs. Douglas rests In a chair on the porch in front of the open door, hearing in her mind a marching band briskly playing \"[[There's a Long Long Trail A-Winding]]\" and seeing a parade of soldiers, while her young son, fresh-faced in his [[doughboy]] uniform, smiles down at her. Mary comes to the door and calls to her, saying \u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly, hadn\u2019t you better come in?\u201d Her mother rises and, with only a little assistance from Mary, walks into the house. Bob, smiling, slowly closes the front door, revealing the [[Service Flag]] Star hanging on it.  \n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Paul Muni]] as Man claiming to be \"James Dyke\", birth name Joseph Anthony Douglas\n*[[Marguerite Churchill]] as Mary Douglas, younger sister of James Anthony Douglas\n*[[John Mack Brown]] as Bob, who asks Mary Douglas to marry him\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n*[[DeWitt Jennings]] as Warden of the prison where \"James Dyke\" is held\n*[[Edith Yorke]] as Mrs. Douglas, mother of Joseph Anthony Douglas\n*Clifford Dempsey as Police lieutenant to whom \"James Dyke\" confesses the killing\n*[[Richard Carlyle (actor, born 1879)|Richard Carlyle]] as Death row chaplain Father Daly\n*[[Henry Kolker]] as Judge who sentences \"James Dyke\" to be executed\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Original source and adaptations==\nScreenwriters [[John Hunter Booth]] and [[Tom Barry (screenwriter)|Tom Barry]] adapted the one-act play by Holworthy Hall [on-screen credits indicate the name as H'''''a'''''lworthy Hall] and [[Robert Middlemass]], which twice closed on its respective [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] opening nights: at the [[Nora Bayes]] Theatre on May 4, 1926 (with William L.

He is allowed to meet and converse with a young woman named Josephine Paris who believes that he might be her long lost brother.

[http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=VVN19290518.2.18 Bert Lytell's Old Act A Hit As Motion Picture], ''Vaudeville News''</ref>\n\nA fleeting character in the film, played by minor, unbilled, actor Henry Hall,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355642/ Henry Hall's credits at IMDb]</ref> is referenced as \"Harold Everett Porter\", the birth name of the play's co-author, whose [[pen name]] was a nod to [[Holworthy Hall]], the dormitory at his ''alma mater'', [[Harvard University]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFilmed concurrently with ''The Valiant'', its [[Spanish-language]] version, ''El valiente'', directed for Fox by Richard Harlan, was screened in those foreign and domestic venues which requested such specific non-English-language versions of Hollywood product, and ultimately had its New York premiere in November 1930, 18 months after the original film completed its run.  The protagonist was portrayed by [[Juan Torena]], the role played by Marguerite Churchill went to Angelita Ben\u00edtez, while John Mack Brown's part was taken by Guillermo del Rinc\u00f3n.  [[Carlos Villar\u00edas]] who, the following year, would play [[Bela Lugosi]]'s iconic role as ''[[Dracula  (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' in that production's [[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|concurrently filmed Spanish-language version]], was cast in Henry Kolker's part as the judge.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142953/ ''El valiente'' at the Internet Movie Database]</ref> \n\n===Adaptations===\nTen tears later, Fox revived the property as ''[[The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1940 film)|The Man Who Wouldn't Talk]]'', a [[B-picture]] directed by [[David Burton (director)|David Burton]], with stars [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Jean Rogers]], and Richard Clarke. Released in January 1940, the film followed Hall's and Middlemass' basic plot outline, but used a different screenplay, reworked by a number of writers, and appended an extended World War I flashback, resolving it all with a happy ending.\n\nAmong the plays presented live on post-World War II British television was a March 27, 1947 adaptation of ''The Valiant''. The setting was a prison in Northern England and the cast included Andrew Osborn as Dyke, [[Ren\u00e9 Ray]] as Josephine Paris, [[Oliver Johnston (actor)|Oliver Johnston]] as the chaplain and [[Ivan Samson]] as the prison governor.\n\nThere were also two adaptations during early days of the period referenced as the [[Golden Age of Television]]. On November 29, 1948, [[NBC]]'s half-hour anthology drama program ''[[Chevrolet on Broadway]]'' presented Paul Muni in a live, abbreviated recreation of his film performance from nearly twenty years earlier, and on October 23, 1950, [[CBS]]' half-hour anthology drama ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'' broadcast another abbreviated version, with [[Zachary Scott]] as the man claiming to be \"James Dyke\" and Wendy Drew as \"The Girl\".\n\n==''Seven Faces''==\nShortly after ''The Valiant'''s premiere on May 19, 1929, Fox cast the two leads, Paul Muni and Marguerite Churchill, in their next feature, ''[[Seven Faces]]'', directed by [[Berthold Viertel]], which was released less than seven months later, on December 1. Between 1929 and 1933, Marguerite Churchill appeared in a total of fifteen features, while Paul Muni acted in only five, with the remaining three being 1932's ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'', followed by 1933's ''[[The World Changes]]''. \n\n== Two Academy Award nominations ==\nAt the [[2nd Academy Awards]], held on April 3, 1930, Paul Muni was one of the five nominees for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], but lost to [[Warner Baxter]]'s portrayal of [[The Cisco Kid]], [[O. Henry]]'s legendary outlaw ''[[In Old Arizona]]''.  ''The Valiant'''s second nomination, [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing]], went to Tom Barry for adapting Halworthy Hall's and Robert Middlemass' play to the screen (Barry was nominated for two titles, the other one being ''In Old Arizona'') but the winner was one of the other four nominees, [[Hans Kraly]], for his work on the [[Emil Jannings]] vehicle, ''[[The Patriot (1928 film)|The Patriot]]'', a silent historical recreation of the 1801 assassination of [[Tsar]] [[Paul I of Russia]].\n\n==Preservation status==\nIn 1994, film historian Jim Knusch, the host and writer of [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]]'s long-running [[Public-access television|public-access]] TV show ''Professor Kinema'', interviewed [[William K.

Inside the police precinct, he  approaches  the desk lieutenant (Clifford Dempsey), who asks, \"Well, what's on your mind?\", he replies, \"I killed a man\", explaining that the victim lived at 191 East 8th Street, was named John Harris, and \"deserved to die\".  Asked for his own name, he hesitates and, spotting a wall calendar (showing May 1928) with a large ad for \"Dyke & Co., Inc.\", says \"Dyke... James Dyke\".  To \"Why are you giving yourself up?\", he answers \"It was the only thing to do\". He won\u2019t answer questions about where he was born or where he lives, and a search reveals that any identifying tags have been removed from his clothes.  \n\n===The condemned man is sentenced to be executed===\nThe subsequent title card states: \"Civilization demands its toll.\"  In court, the trial is over and the judge appeals to the killee to think of those others who may be worrying about him. The killer is only willing to say \u201cI never struck anybody in anger in all my life, but when I knew what he had done, I had to kill him.\"  When God\u2019s judgement is mentioned, he goes on to explain that God will judge him truly, because that other man will be there to tell the story that the court has not heard.  God will know the truth. The judge ([[Henry Kolker]]) proclaims, \"it is the duty of this court to sentence you to be executed at the state's prison during the week of August seventeenth and may God have mercy on your soul.\u201d\n\n===The condemned man's mother, sister and sister's fianc\u00e9===\nAnother title card: \"Meanwhile------in a far-away home....\"  In the backyard of a modest old countryside house, a young woman ([[Marguerite Churchill]]) is attending to her collie dogs, while her wheelchair-bound mother ([[Edith Yorke]]) is sitting nearby.  A young man ([[John Mack Brown]]) arrives and greets the mother as \"Mrs. Douglas.\u201d She addresses him as \"Robert\" and tells him that it was on a nice day like this that she last saw her son Joe, and one such s day she always hopes to see him again. Robert hands her \"your [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] paper\" and goes to greet the young woman, \"Mary\", who calls him \"Bob\".  He attempts to help Mary bathe one of the collies, but Laddie slips out of her grasp. When she falls trying to catch the dog, Bob  kisses her long and hard, tells her he loves her and asks if she loves him.  \u201cI thought so\u201d, she replies, and he tells her she will never be sorry. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t be\u201d, she answers. Their mood is somber rather than cheerful. Although they may be referring to a proposal that happened off camera, the conversation and tone suggest that they have been lovers.\n\nMary's mother calls to them and shows them a photograph of \"James Dyke\" in the paper with the headline  \"CRIME DOESN'T PAY / Condemned Man's / Story Of His Life As / It Should Have Been / A LESSON TO YOUTH ON FOLLY OF CRIME / By The Man of Mystery\".  She tells them that he looks like the long-lost Joe, but Mary says that it must be a mistake. \u201cListen to what Bob has to tell you.\u201d Bob asks for Mary\u2019s hand in marriage, and Mary assured her mother that they will all live together afterwards.\n\n===The condemned man arrives at his final destination===\nThe next title card describes \"Gray walls, claiming their forfeits of liberty------and life.\"  Prisoners are seen laboring in a field outside the prison and, as they return to the mess hall for a meal, a stage above the dining area features an orchestra consisting of African-American prisoners playing dance music for the prisoners as they eat.    \n  \n\"Dyke\" has been transferred to this prison to await his execution. He is brought to the office of the warden ([[DeWitt Jennings]]) who asks him about any family members whom he might like to contact, but the condemned man replies that he has no one, no mother or father or sister or wife or sweetheart, and his name is Dyke. Leaving the office, he hears the jaunty melody resonating from the dining area and says, \"I didn't know you had music... here\".    \n\nA newspaper's printing presses are seen churning out the evening edition with the headlines: \"Mystery of Dyke's Identity / Secret as Hour of Death Nears / Prisoner Staunchly Refuses to Divulge / Secret of Himself or the Motive for / His Crime Though He Faces Chair / James Dyke Maintains Silence as He Writes News- / paper Articles Warning Youth on the Folly of Crime\"  One of the pressmen (unbilled [[Robert Homans]]) tells another that he heard the paper was paying Dyke $2,500 for his writings and another (unbilled [[Tom Wilson (actor)|Tom Wilson]]) jokes that Dyke might be buying [[Liberty Bonds]] with the money and adds that he will probably do something with it before he dies ($2,500 in 1929 is worth $36,600 today using the [[Consumer price index|CPI]]\u2014a very conservative measure\u2014or $76,500.00 using the \u201creal\u201d price) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/uscompare/relativevalue.php|title=Measuring Worth|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}.</ref>  \n\n===Seeing the condemned man's photo, his mother insists on traveling to see him===\nSitting in her bedroom, the infirm Mrs. Douglas visualizes old memories of teenage Joe (unbilled [[Barton Hepburn]]) telling his little sister Mary about being cast in a school production of a  [[Shakespeare]] play\u2014Macbeth, judging by his description of the \u201cterrible witches\u201d\u2014and how, at bedtime, instead of \"goodnight\", he taught her to recite to him the \"parting is such sweet sorrow\" lines, while he would respond with \"sleep dwell upon thine eyes...\u201d. Meanwhile, in the living room, Mary and Bob are in the midst of a party to celebrate their engagement and, as the happy couple and invited guests dance, everyone joins in singing a fast chorus of \"Hosanna, hosanna, sing hosanna today\".  Briefly leaving their guests to check on Mrs. Douglas, Mary and Bob hear from her that, despite fragile health, she has decided to make the long trip to visit \"James Dyke\" in prison. The possibility, however tiny, that he might be Joe is making the uncertainty unbearable.  Mary, afraid the trip would kill her mother, offers to travel on her mother's behalf, with Bob accompanying her on the trip. She knows how to make herself known to Joe, if it is he.\n\nAs Mary and Bob sit in a moving train, a middle-aged woman (unbilled Lillian Lawrence) asks inane questions of the conductor while a little girl (unbilled [[Helen Parrish]]) comes over to Mary and Bob, tells them that her name is Suzanne and asks if they also have a little girl, prompting Mary to tell Bob that she couldn't marry him \"if this man in prison should be my brother\", because \"it wouldn't be fair to you\" and \"people are cruel, they would never let you forget. He tells her not to be silly, but she says \u201cThat\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d\n\n===Section of the plot which corresponds to the one-act play on which the film is based===\nA title card reads \"The test of the valiant.\"   Dyke is escorted to the warden, who commends his exemplary behavior and asks what he wants done with the $2,500 in Liberty Bonds which are being held in the office for him.  There must be someone to send them to. Yes there is, but that would give away his identity. Dyke adds that he'll think of something.  Also present is the chaplain ([[Richard Carlyle]]) who, along with the warden, tries to convince him to see the young lady who traveled a thousand miles to speak with him in the hope that he might be her long-lost brother. The distance she has traveled gives Dyke pause and he eventually agrees, but requests privacy for the meeting, which is granted.  The warden speaks with Mary alone, first, learning that she is from the (fictitious) town of Pennington in [[Ohio]]; that her father died when she was a baby; that her brother Joe, who is 10 years older than she, left home 15 years ago because \"he wanted to be in the city\" and has not been heard from since.  She is certain, however, that she could recognize him from his reactions to their long-ago \"goodnight\" exchange of verses from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. She says them aloud for the warden to hear.  \n\nDyke is brought into the office, but there is no sign of recognition.  The warden introduces Mary as \u201cthe young lady who has come all the way from Pennington, Ohio, to see you\u201d; he does not mention her name.  The warden and the chaplain are in one room and the guard in the next, leaving the two alone, but with all doors open.  After Mary's explanation of her reasons for coming, Dyke, who avoids making eye contact with her throughout most of the scene\u2014denies being her brother and does not react to her questioning or to the verses, which he dismisses as silly. When Mary tells him that her mother is ill and will never really get better until she knows what happened to Joe,  Dyke asks Mary what her name is.  Mary Douglas, she replies. Douglas? he asks, thinking aloud, trying to remember. ..Joseph Anthony Douglas. \u201cThat\u2018s Joe\u201d she cries. How...? Dyke tells her that when the [[World War I|War]] began he enlisted and went overseas for four years with the Canadians.\n\nHer eyes never leave his face as he gives an animated description of an act of heroism \u2014 a young soldier showed great valor in risking his life, braving shot and shell to rescue a wounded officer, but dying when a 5.9 landed on them both.  The dead hero's name was Douglas. Joseph Douglas. Joseph Anthony Douglas \u2014 Dyke remembers the name on the dog tags. If an officer had been there there would have been a medal. Many men would have liked to die that way. He tells her to write to Ottawa for the official records. They\u2019ll be able to tell her his battalion and when he went overseas and so forth, although the records are so confused that they might not tell her about his heroism. They might say he was missing or died of wounds or even served out to the end of the war and was honorably discharged: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what happened to half the men.\u201d   \n\nHe asks her to take the unopened envelope (containing the Liberty Bonds) and give it to her mother\u2014a sort of memorial to her son from the man who saw her son die. He asks [[American Gold Star Mothers|that her mother buy a little gold star to wear for her boy]]. He asks Mary to do the same, and wear it over her heart  When she says that she will sometimes think of him, he scoffs at the idea and says that he isn\u2018t fit to be mentioned in the same breath as her brother. Mary asks if there is anything she can do, and he responds that it would mean the world to him if she would say good-bye to him like the sister he never had. After a long, gentle hug, Mary starts to cry, wishing she could have said her special goodnight to her brother one more time. He tells her to say it and she does: \u201cGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow that I should say goodnight \u2018til it be morrow.\u201d\n\nShe runs out sobbing, past the warden and  the chaplain, who gaze at him, speechless. Then \u201cJames Dyke\" tenderly recites, in the presence of the two men,  \u201cSleep dwell upon thine eyes, Peace in thy breast. Would I were Sleep and Peace, so sweet to rest.\u201d  In a long speech, he thanks the warden for letting him see that girl, because he sees how lucky he is to be alone... \u201dIf I had a family,\u201d he says in a warning voice, \u201cit would never be over for them. They would have to go on living and suffering.\u201d The chaplain puts his hand on Dyke\u2019s back and says, in a voice filled with compassion, \u201cMy son. \u201c  \n\nIt is time for the execution. Dyke says, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n===The condemned man's family remembers him as a war hero===  \nBack in Pennington, Mary and Bob sit at the piano, playing \u201c[[Love's Old Sweet Song]]\u201d, and talking of how much better it is now that her mother knows and is so very proud of her \u201chero boy.\u201d Mrs. Douglas rests In a chair on the porch in front of the open door, hearing in her mind a marching band briskly playing \"[[There's a Long Long Trail A-Winding]]\" and seeing a parade of soldiers, while her young son, fresh-faced in his [[doughboy]] uniform, smiles down at her. Mary comes to the door and calls to her, saying \u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly, hadn\u2019t you better come in?\u201d Her mother rises and, with only a little assistance from Mary, walks into the house. Bob, smiling, slowly closes the front door, revealing the [[Service Flag]] Star hanging on it.  \n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Paul Muni]] as Man claiming to be \"James Dyke\", birth name Joseph Anthony Douglas\n*[[Marguerite Churchill]] as Mary Douglas, younger sister of James Anthony Douglas\n*[[John Mack Brown]] as Bob, who asks Mary Douglas to marry him\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n*[[DeWitt Jennings]] as Warden of the prison where \"James Dyke\" is held\n*[[Edith Yorke]] as Mrs. Douglas, mother of Joseph Anthony Douglas\n*Clifford Dempsey as Police lieutenant to whom \"James Dyke\" confesses the killing\n*[[Richard Carlyle (actor, born 1879)|Richard Carlyle]] as Death row chaplain Father Daly\n*[[Henry Kolker]] as Judge who sentences \"James Dyke\" to be executed\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Original source and adaptations==\nScreenwriters [[John Hunter Booth]] and [[Tom Barry (screenwriter)|Tom Barry]] adapted the one-act play by Holworthy Hall [on-screen credits indicate the name as H'''''a'''''lworthy Hall] and [[Robert Middlemass]], which twice closed on its respective [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] opening nights: at the [[Nora Bayes]] Theatre on May 4, 1926 (with William L.

Half an hour before the execution, the chaplain and the warden are making a final attempt at persuading \"James Dyke\" to reveal his identity.  He is allowed to meet and converse with a young woman named Josephine Paris who believes that he might be her long lost brother.

[http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=VVN19290518.2.18 Bert Lytell's Old Act A Hit As Motion Picture], ''Vaudeville News''</ref>\n\nA fleeting character in the film, played by minor, unbilled, actor Henry Hall,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355642/ Henry Hall's credits at IMDb]</ref> is referenced as \"Harold Everett Porter\", the birth name of the play's co-author, whose [[pen name]] was a nod to [[Holworthy Hall]], the dormitory at his ''alma mater'', [[Harvard University]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFilmed concurrently with ''The Valiant'', its [[Spanish-language]] version, ''El valiente'', directed for Fox by Richard Harlan, was screened in those foreign and domestic venues which requested such specific non-English-language versions of Hollywood product, and ultimately had its New York premiere in November 1930, 18 months after the original film completed its run.  The protagonist was portrayed by [[Juan Torena]], the role played by Marguerite Churchill went to Angelita Ben\u00edtez, while John Mack Brown's part was taken by Guillermo del Rinc\u00f3n.  [[Carlos Villar\u00edas]] who, the following year, would play [[Bela Lugosi]]'s iconic role as ''[[Dracula  (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' in that production's [[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|concurrently filmed Spanish-language version]], was cast in Henry Kolker's part as the judge.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142953/ ''El valiente'' at the Internet Movie Database]</ref> \n\n===Adaptations===\nTen tears later, Fox revived the property as ''[[The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1940 film)|The Man Who Wouldn't Talk]]'', a [[B-picture]] directed by [[David Burton (director)|David Burton]], with stars [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Jean Rogers]], and Richard Clarke. Released in January 1940, the film followed Hall's and Middlemass' basic plot outline, but used a different screenplay, reworked by a number of writers, and appended an extended World War I flashback, resolving it all with a happy ending.\n\nAmong the plays presented live on post-World War II British television was a March 27, 1947 adaptation of ''The Valiant''. The setting was a prison in Northern England and the cast included Andrew Osborn as Dyke, [[Ren\u00e9 Ray]] as Josephine Paris, [[Oliver Johnston (actor)|Oliver Johnston]] as the chaplain and [[Ivan Samson]] as the prison governor.\n\nThere were also two adaptations during early days of the period referenced as the [[Golden Age of Television]]. On November 29, 1948, [[NBC]]'s half-hour anthology drama program ''[[Chevrolet on Broadway]]'' presented Paul Muni in a live, abbreviated recreation of his film performance from nearly twenty years earlier, and on October 23, 1950, [[CBS]]' half-hour anthology drama ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'' broadcast another abbreviated version, with [[Zachary Scott]] as the man claiming to be \"James Dyke\" and Wendy Drew as \"The Girl\".\n\n==''Seven Faces''==\nShortly after ''The Valiant'''s premiere on May 19, 1929, Fox cast the two leads, Paul Muni and Marguerite Churchill, in their next feature, ''[[Seven Faces]]'', directed by [[Berthold Viertel]], which was released less than seven months later, on December 1. Between 1929 and 1933, Marguerite Churchill appeared in a total of fifteen features, while Paul Muni acted in only five, with the remaining three being 1932's ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'', followed by 1933's ''[[The World Changes]]''. \n\n== Two Academy Award nominations ==\nAt the [[2nd Academy Awards]], held on April 3, 1930, Paul Muni was one of the five nominees for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], but lost to [[Warner Baxter]]'s portrayal of [[The Cisco Kid]], [[O. Henry]]'s legendary outlaw ''[[In Old Arizona]]''.  ''The Valiant'''s second nomination, [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing]], went to Tom Barry for adapting Halworthy Hall's and Robert Middlemass' play to the screen (Barry was nominated for two titles, the other one being ''In Old Arizona'') but the winner was one of the other four nominees, [[Hans Kraly]], for his work on the [[Emil Jannings]] vehicle, ''[[The Patriot (1928 film)|The Patriot]]'', a silent historical recreation of the 1801 assassination of [[Tsar]] [[Paul I of Russia]].\n\n==Preservation status==\nIn 1994, film historian Jim Knusch, the host and writer of [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]]'s long-running [[Public-access television|public-access]] TV show ''Professor Kinema'', interviewed [[William K.

The [[air traffic controller]] in charge of the Western section of [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar]] had been working for more than six hours by 13:30:44, the time the Yak-40 entered his sector of airspace while at an altitude of 5,700 meters.  After receiving confirmation from the controller the Yak-40 continued the flight path and reported passing the Novodmitrievskaya [[non-directional beacon]] at 13:34 and remained at an altitude of 5,700 meters.  After passing that point the flight was supposed to decrease altitude in accordance with the flight plan, but the controller was busy managing other flights so he let the flight continue on to the Gelenjik-Kerch part of the route at the 5,700-meter altitude.  At 13:43 the Yak-40 reported passing Gelendzhik and stated its altitude to be 5,700 meters, to which the controller responding by granting it permission to proceed with the Anapa transverse but yet again forgot to instruct the aircraft to change altitude.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Antonov An-24 departed from Donetsk Airport at 12:56 for the flight to Sochi. At 13:32 the crew reported entering the Western section of Krasnodar on the Primorsko-Akhtarsk traverse at an altitude of 5,700 meters \u2013 the same altitude as the Yak-40 in the same section of airspace.  The controller responded by permitting the An-24 to proceed to Anapa and keep the current altitude, then gave permission for the aircraft to continue on to Dzhubga without changing altitude.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAt 13:51:05 Moscow time, the An-24 and Yak-40 collided in the air at an altitude of 5,700 meters, severing the tail sections of both aircraft.  Both aircraft broke apart in mid-air and the wreckage fell into the [[Black Sea]]. All 70 people in the two aircraft were killed in the accident.

Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a [[slow irregular variable]] star that ranges in brightness from [[apparent magnitude]] +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by [[Sigma Scorpii|\u03c3 Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]] near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as [[stellar classification#Spectral types|spectral type]] [[Stellar classification#Class M|M1.5Iab-Ib]], Antares is a [[red supergiant]], a large evolved massive star.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the [[Solar System]] it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times [[Solar mass|that of the Sun]].\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]], the [[Scorpius\u2013Centaurus Association]]. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about {{convert|170|pc|ly|lk=on}} from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a [[binary star]], with its two components called \u03b1 Scorpii A and \u03b1 Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 5.5.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Infrared Rho Ophiuchi Complex.jpg|thumb|left|Antares between [[sigma Scorpii|\u03c3]] and [[tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]].

Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator. For two to three weeks on either side of November 30 Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun.<ref name=\"LASCO\"/> In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64\u00b0 northern latitude, the star does not rise at all. On the other side in the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64\u00b0 S latitude. <!--this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[celestial latitude]] is south of the ecliptic.-->\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Antares near the Sun every year around 2 December.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antares near the Sun on 30 November]][[Radial velocity]] variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century<ref name=wright/> and attempts were made to derive [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic]] orbits.<ref name=lunt/>  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.

There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example {{solar luminosity|75,900}} and {{solar luminosity|97,700}} published in 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /><ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" />\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about {{solar mass|12}},<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or {{solar mass|11 to 14.3}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Comparison of the [[effective temperature]] and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of {{solar mass|17}} and an age of 12 million years (MYr),<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or an initial mass of {{solar mass|15}} and an age of 11 to 15 MYr.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as [[supernova]]e.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n[[File:Redgiants.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Comparison between the [[red supergiant]] Antares and the Sun, shown as the tiny dot toward the upper right|alt=Portion of a large yellow-orange circle representing Antares, with a black circle for the orbit of [[Mars]], and images of [[Arcturus]] and the sun to scale]]\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed.<ref name=\"Ireland2004\" /> In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by {{solar radius|165}} or 19%.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind [[radial velocity]] changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.<ref name=\"pugh2013\" />\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using [[interferometry]] or observing [[Occultation|lunar occultation]]s events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 \u00b1 0.1 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|milliarcseconds]] has been published.<ref name=\"richichi\" /> Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a [[Limb darkening|limb-darkened]] disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as {{val|37.38|0.06|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2009 and {{val|37.31|0.09|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe [[Hipparcos]] satellite's [[parallax|trigonometric parallax]] of {{val|5.89|1.00|u=mas}}<ref name=\"HIPPARCOS\" /> leads to a radius of about {{solar radius|680}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Older radii estimates exceeding {{solar radius|850}} were derived from older measurements of the diameter,<ref name=\"pugh2013\" /> but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], which is almost 30 times larger in terms of volume, or [[VV Cephei]] A and [[Mu Cephei]].\n\nAntares, like the similarly-sized red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], will almost certainly explode as a [[supernova]],<ref name=\"Firestone2014\" /> possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n===Antares B===\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main-sequence star]] of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.<ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\" />  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around {{solar mass|7|link=y}}, a temperature around {{val|18,500|fmt=commas|ul=K}}, and a radius of about {{solar radius|5}}.<ref name=antaresb/>\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"schaaf\" /> It is often described as green, but this is probably either a [[contrast effect]],<ref name=\"kaler\" /> or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares is hidden by the Moon.<ref name=\"burnham\" />  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.<ref name=\"Johnson1879\" /><ref name=\"burnham\" /><ref name=crossley/>\n\n==Etymology and mythology==\n[[File:Antares overlooking an Auxiliary Telescope.jpg|thumb|left|Antares seen from the ground]]\nIn the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\". In [[MUL.APIN]], which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and marks breast of the Scorpion goddess [[Ishara|Ishhara]].<ref name=rogers/> Later names that translate as \"the Heart of Scorpion\" include ''{{lang|la|Calbalakrab}}'' from the Arabic ''{{transl|ar|Qalb al-\u0386qrab}}''.<ref name=kunitzsch/> This had been directly translated from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c5}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kardia Skorpi\u016b}}''. ''{{lang|la|Cor Scorpii}}'' translated above Greek name into [[Latin]].<ref name=\"allen\" />\n\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Antares may have been known by the following names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (\"the Lord of the Seed\"), Kak-shisa (\"the Creator of Prosperity\"), Dar Lugal (\"The King\"), Masu Sar (\"the Hero and the King\"), and Kakkab Bir (\"the Vermilion Star\").<ref name=\"allen\" /> In ancient [[Egypt]], Antares represented the scorpion goddess [[Serket]] (and was the symbol of [[Isis]] in the pyramidal ceremonies).<ref name=\"allen\" /> It was called ''<u>t</u>ms n <u>h</u>ntt'' \"the red one of the prow\".  \n<ref name=lull/>\n\nIn [[Persia]] Antares was known as ''Satevis'', one of the four \"[[royal stars]]\". In [[India]], it with [[Sigma Scorpii|\u03c3 Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]] were [[Jyeshtha (nakshatra)|Jyeshth\u0101]] (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one of the ''[[nakshatra]]'' ([[Hindu]] [[lunar mansion]]s).<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nThe ancient Chinese called Antares \u5fc3\u5bbf\u4e8c (''X\u012bnxi\u00f9'\u00e8r'', \"second star of mansion Heart\"), because it was the second star of the mansion ''[[Heart (Chinese constellation)|Xin]]'' (\u5fc3). It was the national star of the [[Shang Dynasty]], and it was sometimes referred to as ({{zh|c=\u706b\u661f|p=Hu\u01d2x\u012bng|l=fiery star}}) because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people]] of New Zealand call Antares ''R\u0113hua'', and regard it as the chief of all the stars. R\u0113hua is father of ''[[Puanga]]/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]]), an important star in the calculation of the M\u0101ori calendar. The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (''Balayang'') as the brother of ''Bunjil'' ([[Altair]]).<ref name=mudrooroo/>\n\n==In culture==\n{{See also|Stars and planetary systems in fiction#Antares (Alpha Scorpii)}}\n\nAntares appears in the [[flag of Brazil]], which displays 27 stars, each representing a [[States of Brazil|federated unit of Brazil]].

Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a [[slow irregular variable]] star that ranges in brightness from [[apparent magnitude]] +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by [[Sigma Scorpii|\u03c3 Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]] near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as [[stellar classification#Spectral types|spectral type]] [[Stellar classification#Class M|M1.5Iab-Ib]], Antares is a [[red supergiant]], a large evolved massive star.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the [[Solar System]] it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times [[Solar mass|that of the Sun]].\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]], the [[Scorpius\u2013Centaurus Association]]. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about {{convert|170|pc|ly|lk=on}} from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a [[binary star]], with its two components called \u03b1 Scorpii A and \u03b1 Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 5.5.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Infrared Rho Ophiuchi Complex.jpg|thumb|left|Antares between [[sigma Scorpii|\u03c3]] and [[tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]]. Antares appears white in this [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] false colour [[infrared]] image.]]\n''\u03b1 Scorpii'' (Latinised to ''Alpha Scorpii'') is the star's [[Bayer designation]]. Antares has the [[Flamsteed designation]] 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] and HD 148478 in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]]. As a prominent [[infrared]] source, it appears in the [[Two Micron All-Sky Survey]] catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas]] catalogue as IRAS 16262\u20132619. It is also catalogued as a double star [[Washington Double Star Catalog|WDS]] J16294-2626 and [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars|CCDM]] J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate [[variable star designation]].<ref name=gcvs/>\n\nIts traditional name ''Antares'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2}},<ref name=LSJ/> meaning \"rival to-[[Ares]]\" (\"opponent to-Mars\"), due to the similarity of its [[red]]dish hue to the appearance of the planet [[Mars]].<ref name=gettings/> The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamian astronomers]].<ref name=\"allen\"/> Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after [[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antar]], or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the [[Arabs|Arab]] warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems [[Mu'allaqat]].<ref name=\"allen\" /> In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organised a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)<ref name=\"WGSN\"/> to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016<ref name=\"WGSN1\"/> included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included ''Antares'' for the star \u03b1 Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/>\n\n== Observation ==\nAntares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at [[opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]] to the [[Sun]]. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator. For two to three weeks on either side of November 30 Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun.<ref name=\"LASCO\"/> In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64\u00ba northern latitude, the star does not rise at all. On the other side in the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64\u00ba S latitude. <!--this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[celestial latitude]] is south of the ecliptic.-->\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Antares near the Sun every year around 2 December.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antares near the Sun on 30 November]][[Radial velocity]] variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century<ref name=wright/> and attempts were made to derive [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic]] orbits.<ref name=lunt/>  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.<ref name=spencerjones/>\n\nAntares was first reported to have a companion star by [[Johann Tobias B\u00fcrg]] during an occultation on April 13, 1819,<ref name=\"burnham\" /> although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.<ref name=\"Johnson1879\" />  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer [[James William Grant (astronomer)|James William Grant]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] while in [[India]] on 23 July 1844.<ref name=wikisource/> It was rediscovered by [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]] in 1846,<ref name=crossley/> and measured by [[William Rutter Dawes]] in April 1847.<ref name=innes/><ref name=dawes/>\n\nIn 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.<ref name=cousins/>  The brightness has been monitored by the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]] since 1945,<ref name=aavso/> and it has been classified as an ''LC'' [[slow irregular variable]] star, whose [[apparent magnitude]] slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or {{val|1,650|640}} days.<ref name=\"kiss\" /> No separate long secondary period has been detected,<ref name=\"percy\" /> although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.<ref name=\"kiss\" />\n\nResearch published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').<ref name=hamacher/>\n\n=== Occultations and conjunctions ===\n[[File:Antares-R.webm|thumb|right|Lunar Occultation of Antares (reappearance) was observed on 2006 May 14 from The Blue Mountains, Australia.

The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. [[Venus]], but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400.<ref name=jbaa/> Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares.<ref name=nightwatch/> Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass ''south'' of the star.<ref>https://www.skyandtelescope.com/interactive-sky-chart/</ref>\n\n==Stellar system==\n\u03b1 Scorpii is a double star that are thought to form a [[binary system]].

There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example {{solar luminosity|75,900}} and {{solar luminosity|97,700}} published in 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /><ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" />\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about {{solar mass|12}},<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or {{solar mass|11 to 14.3}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Comparison of the [[effective temperature]] and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of {{solar mass|17}} and an age of 12 million years (MYr),<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or an initial mass of {{solar mass|15}} and an age of 11 to 15 MYr.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as [[supernova]]e.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n[[File:Redgiants.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Comparison between the [[red supergiant]] Antares and the Sun, shown as the tiny dot toward the upper right|alt=Portion of a large yellow-orange circle representing Antares, with a black circle for the orbit of [[Mars]], and images of [[Arcturus]] and the sun to scale]]\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed.<ref name=\"Ireland2004\" /> In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by {{solar radius|165}} or 19%.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind [[radial velocity]] changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.<ref name=\"pugh2013\" />\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using [[interferometry]] or observing [[Occultation|lunar occultation]]s events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 \u00b1 0.1 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|milliarcseconds]] has been published.<ref name=\"richichi\" /> Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a [[Limb darkening|limb-darkened]] disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as {{val|37.38|0.06|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2009 and {{val|37.31|0.09|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe [[Hipparcos]] satellite's [[parallax|trigonometric parallax]] of {{val|5.89|1.00|u=mas}}<ref name=\"HIPPARCOS\" /> leads to a radius of about {{solar radius|680}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Older radii estimates exceeding {{solar radius|850}} were derived from older measurements of the diameter,<ref name=\"pugh2013\" /> but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], which is almost 30 times larger in terms of volume, or [[VV Cephei]] A and [[Mu Cephei]].\n\nAntares, like the similarly-sized red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], will almost certainly explode as a [[supernova]],<ref name=\"Firestone2014\" /> possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n===Antares B===\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main-sequence star]] of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.<ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\" />  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around {{solar mass|7|link=y}}, a temperature around {{val|18,500|fmt=commas|ul=K}}, and a radius of about {{solar radius|5}}.<ref name=antaresb/>\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"schaaf\" /> It is often described as green, but this is probably either a [[contrast effect]],<ref name=\"kaler\" /> or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares is hidden by the Moon.<ref name=\"burnham\" />  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.<ref name=\"Johnson1879\" /><ref name=\"burnham\" /><ref name=crossley/>\n\n==Etymology and mythology==\n[[File:Antares overlooking an Auxiliary Telescope.jpg|thumb|left|Antares seen from the ground]]\nIn the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\". In [[MUL.APIN]], which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and marks breast of the Scorpion goddess [[Ishara|Ishhara]].<ref name=rogers/> Later names that translate as \"the Heart of Scorpion\" include ''{{lang|la|Calbalakrab}}'' from the Arabic ''{{transl|ar|Qalb al-\u0386qrab}}''.<ref name=kunitzsch/> This had been directly translated from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c5}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kardia Skorpi\u016b}}''. ''{{lang|la|Cor Scorpii}}'' translated above Greek name into [[Latin]].<ref name=\"allen\" />\n\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Antares may have been known by the following names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (\"the Lord of the Seed\"), Kak-shisa (\"the Creator of Prosperity\"), Dar Lugal (\"The King\"), Masu Sar (\"the Hero and the King\"), and Kakkab Bir (\"the Vermilion Star\").<ref name=\"allen\" /> In ancient [[Egypt]], Antares represented the scorpion goddess [[Serket]] (and was the symbol of [[Isis]] in the pyramidal ceremonies).<ref name=\"allen\" /> It was called ''<u>t</u>ms n <u>h</u>ntt'' \"the red one of the prow\".  \n<ref name=lull/>\n\nIn [[Persia]] Antares was known as ''Satevis'', one of the four \"[[royal stars]]\". In [[India]], it with [[Sigma Scorpii|\u03c3 Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]] were [[Jyeshtha (nakshatra)|Jyeshth\u0101]] (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one of the ''[[nakshatra]]'' ([[Hindu]] [[lunar mansion]]s).<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nThe ancient Chinese called Antares \u5fc3\u5bbf\u4e8c (''X\u012bnxi\u00f9'\u00e8r'', \"second star of mansion Heart\"), because it was the second star of the mansion ''[[Heart (Chinese constellation)|Xin]]'' (\u5fc3). It was the national star of the [[Shang Dynasty]], and it was sometimes referred to as ({{zh|c=\u706b\u661f|p=Hu\u01d2x\u012bng|l=fiery star}}) because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people]] of New Zealand call Antares ''R\u0113hua'', and regard it as the chief of all the stars. R\u0113hua is father of ''[[Puanga]]/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]]), an important star in the calculation of the M\u0101ori calendar. The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (''Balayang'') as the brother of ''Bunjil'' ([[Altair]]).<ref name=mudrooroo/>\n\n==In culture==\n{{See also|Stars and planetary systems in fiction#Antares (Alpha Scorpii)}}\n\nAntares appears in the [[flag of Brazil]], which displays 27 stars, each representing a [[States of Brazil|federated unit of Brazil]].
