Those subjects are not only related to each other but also to other important aspects that are very necessary for keeping PHE in a close-knit relationship.\n\n== Why PHE? ==\n\nMore than 1 billion people live in [[ecological hotspot]]s, many of which are remote areas of critically important [[biodiversity]] under intense pressure from human activity. Conservation work is usually located in these remote areas to protect the remaining biodiversity. In the developing world , the communities in these remote areas often suffer from ill health because of limited access to health services or [http://www.cfr.org/women/population-environment-connections/p24656 family planning]. These communities also tend to suffer from poor [[nutrition]], water supplies or [[sanitation]]. Inadequate [[health care]] in these communities is usually because of economic struggles. Livelihoods in the rural communities depend on natural resources and small-scale agriculture, which can force people to use natural resources unsustainably because of pressures such as rapid [[population growth]] or health issues. This can be damaging to [[ecosystem]]s and the biodiversity in these rural areas.\n\nConversely, people\u2019s health relies on the [[Environmental health|health of their environment]]. Their surrounding ecosystem provides them with goods and services such as water, food, medicine, fuel wood, building materials, and other resources.  Damage or disruption of these natural goods and services can have severe consequences for [[human health]].\n\nProjects that take the PHE approach work to create [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/issue-23-to-live-the-sea-reproductive-health-care-and-marine-conservation-madagascar healthier communities and ecosystems]. These projects aim to bring better health services to remote communities to improve participation in conservation efforts. PHE projects also promote family planning services to help slow population growth that can put pressure on [[natural resource]]s. That means PHE approaches strive to simultaneously improve access to health services while helping communities manage their natural resources in ways that improve their health and livelihood even as they protect the environment. Beyond this, the PHE approach also targets synergies between human health and [[ecosystem health]] by including a wide spectrum of development and conservation targets such as the sustainable management of natural resources, improving livelihoods, [[food security]] and nutrition, and by maintaining or restoring habitats and ecosystem functions.  By focusing on the [[synergy]] between communities and their environment, the PHE approach conserves biodiversity while at the same time improving environmental health conditions for the local people. PHE is effective at achieving a wide range of positive results over multiple sectors.\n\n== History of PHE ==\n\nIn the late 1980s conservation organizations and practitioners began to realize the benefits of improving the [[quality of life]] for people by managing biodiversity and natural resources. These projects were initially called [[Integrated Conservation and Development Project|integrated conservation and development projects]] (ICDP) and addressed a wide variety of community development needs. At the end of the 1990s it was realized that ICDPs were not achieving conservation or development goals as successfully as anticipated. This was because the scope of ICDPs was often too broad. One of the lessons learned from ICDP attempts was that the success of the projects depended on the ability to focus on key interventions and avoid excessive complexity. From the lessons learned from early ICDPs the conservation sector gave birth to the PHE approach with a new generation of integrated projects.\n\n[[Program designer]]s began to realize that efforts to conserve biological diversity (biodiversity) in developing countries was most successful in long-term indicators when local people perceived their efforts as serving their economic and cultural interests. This gave birth to the integrated development approach. To achieve success it was found that ICDPs had to consider the linkage between conservation and development objectives in every unique place that the project was implemented. The first step to determining the linkages is to consider where the conservation and [[economic development]] goals intersect. Development interventions should then be introduced where this intersection occurs.\n\nOne of the most important lessons learned from ICDPs in the last 20 years was the failure to equitably involve projected beneficiaries as partners in all phases of project implementation, from design through evaluation, has led to consistently disappointing project results. It must be recognized that local participants are not a homogenous group of community members but differ widely in terms of access and dependency of resources, economic positions and their sensitivity to [[environmental change]]s. These lessons learned from past ICDPs has led the design of the [[stakeholder analysis]] where individuals or groups vested in the project are identified and incorporated into all stages of project design and implementation.\n\nDrawing on what was learned from ICDPs, the conservation sector piloted the PHE approach during the 1990s with the first generation of PHE integrated projects. Since then USAID (the [[United States Agency for International Development]]), the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]], [[Johnson & Johnson]], and the Summit Foundation have worked to strengthen the approach. The PHE approach has pushed on with the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) in mind. As the PHE approach advances it has demonstrated to have the kind of synergies needed to reach these goals.\n\n==Past PHE Project Profiles==\n\n'''Successful Communities from Ridge to Reef, Kenya:'''\nThis project was implemented in an area designated a [[UNESCO]] reserve in the [[Kiunga Marine National Reserve|Kiunga National Marine Reserve]]. The reserve has outstanding [[marine biodiversity]] of over 11,000 species, 60-70% of which are endemic to the [[Indo-Pacific]] Ocean. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) with funding from USAID, was able to provide communities that depend on the reserve\u2019s resources access to family planning through a mobile clinic. Members of the community began to actively participate in conservation activities once they know WWF was willing to help them meet basic health needs.\n\n'''Healthy Families, Health Forests, Cambodia:'''\nWhen refugees from the [[Cambodia]]/[[Vietnam]] war in the 1970s returned to their homes they found their land had been destroyed through logging and agriculture. With USAID support, [[Conservation International]] helped the Khmer Daeum [[refugee]]s to replenish their land and supplied the refugees with their first-ever access to family planning. Healthy families were able to develop long-term plans for sustainable [[land use]] and local women created associations that mobilized the community to increase income earning opportunities and strengthen participation in conservation activities.\n\n'''Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM), Philippines'''\nRapid population growth in the [[Philippines]] has led to [[deforestation]] and destruction of [[coral reef]]s. Only 3% of original forest cover remains and only 5% of coral reefs are intact and in pristine condition. This uncontrollable population growth, coupled with the depletion of coastal resources led to the development of the Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM) project with support from USAID and PATH Foundation Philippines Inc. The IPOPCORM Project focuses on communities in the Philippines\u2019 most endangered coastal reef areas and works to improve food security and livelihoods by promoting family planning and sustainable [[fisheries management]]. The program has earned strong support from local mayors and community members who have appreciated IPOPCORM\u2019s focus on improving livelihoods.\n\n'''Population and Resource Management in Madagascar'''\n[[Africa]]\u2019s greatest concentration of unique plant and animal species can be found in [[Madagascar]].  These species have been historically threatened by rapid population growth leading to deforestation. USAID/Madagascar planned for the development of an innovative population and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] program in the region that linked community-based [[natural resource management]] with interventions to improve [[family health]] and planning while allowing for better preservation of the island\u2019s unique biodiversity. The program had worked with local communities in order to support family planning services, [[sustainable agriculture]], good governance, improved food production, alternative livelihoods, and [[environmental education]].\n\n'''Community-Centered Conservation Efforts in Tanzania'''\nThe [[Jane Goodall Institute]], with funding from USAID/[[Tanzania]], constructed the TACARE project to eliminate [[poverty]] and support sustainable livelihoods, while alleviating the depletion of natural resources in the country. The community-based approach aimed to improve the livelihoods in Tanzanian communities while promoting conservation and an understanding of the need to preserve biodiversity. This approach provides family planning methods, information, and counseling by community volunteers that has resulted in a greater acceptance of family planning. With funding from USAID/Washington the TACARE approach is being replicated in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].\n\n'''Andean Highlands of Ecuador'''\nA collaborative operations research effort by CEMOPLAF, [[World Neighbors]], and the [[University of Michigan]]\u2019s Population-Environment Fellows Program was supported by USAID.

Those subjects are not only related to each other but also to other important aspects that are very necessary for keeping PHE in a close-knit relationship.\n\n== Why PHE? ==\n\nMore than 1 billion people live in [[ecological hotspot]]s, many of which are remote areas of critically important [[biodiversity]] under intense pressure from human activity. Conservation work is usually located in these remote areas to protect the remaining biodiversity. In the developing world , the communities in these remote areas often suffer from ill health because of limited access to health services or [http://www.cfr.org/women/population-environment-connections/p24656 family planning]. These communities also tend to suffer from poor [[nutrition]], water supplies or [[sanitation]]. Inadequate [[health care]] in these communities is usually because of economic struggles. Livelihoods in the rural communities depend on natural resources and small-scale agriculture, which can force people to use natural resources unsustainably because of pressures such as rapid [[population growth]] or health issues. This can be damaging to [[ecosystem]]s and the biodiversity in these rural areas.\n\nConversely, people\u2019s health relies on the [[Environmental health|health of their environment]]. Their surrounding ecosystem provides them with goods and services such as water, food, medicine, fuel wood, building materials, and other resources.  Damage or disruption of these natural goods and services can have severe consequences for [[human health]].\n\nProjects that take the PHE approach work to create [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/issue-23-to-live-the-sea-reproductive-health-care-and-marine-conservation-madagascar healthier communities and ecosystems]. These projects aim to bring better health services to remote communities to improve participation in conservation efforts. PHE projects also promote family planning services to help slow population growth that can put pressure on [[natural resource]]s. That means PHE approaches strive to simultaneously improve access to health services while helping communities manage their natural resources in ways that improve their health and livelihood even as they protect the environment. Beyond this, the PHE approach also targets synergies between human health and [[ecosystem health]] by including a wide spectrum of development and conservation targets such as the sustainable management of natural resources, improving livelihoods, [[food security]] and nutrition, and by maintaining or restoring habitats and ecosystem functions.  By focusing on the [[synergy]] between communities and their environment, the PHE approach conserves biodiversity while at the same time improving environmental health conditions for the local people. PHE is effective at achieving a wide range of positive results over multiple sectors.\n\n== History of PHE ==\n\nIn the late 1980s conservation organizations and practitioners began to realize the benefits of improving the [[quality of life]] for people by managing biodiversity and natural resources. These projects were initially called [[Integrated Conservation and Development Project|integrated conservation and development projects]] (ICDP) and addressed a wide variety of community development needs. At the end of the 1990s it was realized that ICDPs were not achieving conservation or development goals as successfully as anticipated. This was because the scope of ICDPs was often too broad. One of the lessons learned from ICDP attempts was that the success of the projects depended on the ability to focus on key interventions and avoid excessive complexity. From the lessons learned from early ICDPs the conservation sector gave birth to the PHE approach with a new generation of integrated projects.\n\n[[Program designer]]s began to realize that efforts to conserve biological diversity (biodiversity) in developing countries was most successful in long-term indicators when local people perceived their efforts as serving their economic and cultural interests. This gave birth to the integrated development approach. To achieve success it was found that ICDPs had to consider the linkage between conservation and development objectives in every unique place that the project was implemented. The first step to determining the linkages is to consider where the conservation and [[economic development]] goals intersect. Development interventions should then be introduced where this intersection occurs.\n\nOne of the most important lessons learned from ICDPs in the last 20 years was the failure to equitably involve projected beneficiaries as partners in all phases of project implementation, from design through evaluation, has led to consistently disappointing project results. It must be recognized that local participants are not a homogenous group of community members but differ widely in terms of access and dependency of resources, economic positions and their sensitivity to [[environmental change]]s. These lessons learned from past ICDPs has led the design of the [[stakeholder analysis]] where individuals or groups vested in the project are identified and incorporated into all stages of project design and implementation.\n\nDrawing on what was learned from ICDPs, the conservation sector piloted the PHE approach during the 1990s with the first generation of PHE integrated projects. Since then USAID (the [[United States Agency for International Development]]), the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]], [[Johnson & Johnson]], and the Summit Foundation have worked to strengthen the approach. The PHE approach has pushed on with the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) in mind. As the PHE approach advances it has demonstrated to have the kind of synergies needed to reach these goals.\n\n==Past PHE Project Profiles==\n\n'''Successful Communities from Ridge to Reef, Kenya:'''\nThis project was implemented in an area designated a [[UNESCO]] reserve in the [[Kiunga Marine National Reserve|Kiunga National Marine Reserve]]. The reserve has outstanding [[marine biodiversity]] of over 11,000 species, 60-70% of which are endemic to the [[Indo-Pacific]] Ocean. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) with funding from USAID, was able to provide communities that depend on the reserve\u2019s resources access to family planning through a mobile clinic. Members of the community began to actively participate in conservation activities once they know WWF was willing to help them meet basic health needs.\n\n'''Healthy Families, Health Forests, Cambodia:'''\nWhen refugees from the [[Cambodia]]/[[Vietnam]] war in the 1970s returned to their homes they found their land had been destroyed through logging and agriculture. With USAID support, [[Conservation International]] helped the Khmer Daeum [[refugee]]s to replenish their land and supplied the refugees with their first-ever access to family planning. Healthy families were able to develop long-term plans for sustainable [[land use]] and local women created associations that mobilized the community to increase income earning opportunities and strengthen participation in conservation activities.\n\n'''Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM), Philippines'''\nRapid population growth in the [[Philippines]] has led to [[deforestation]] and destruction of [[coral reef]]s. Only 3% of original forest cover remains and only 5% of coral reefs are intact and in pristine condition. This uncontrollable population growth, coupled with the depletion of coastal resources led to the development of the Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM) project with support from USAID and PATH Foundation Philippines Inc. The IPOPCORM Project focuses on communities in the Philippines\u2019 most endangered coastal reef areas and works to improve food security and livelihoods by promoting family planning and sustainable [[fisheries management]]. The program has earned strong support from local mayors and community members who have appreciated IPOPCORM\u2019s focus on improving livelihoods.\n\n'''Population and Resource Management in Madagascar'''\n[[Africa]]\u2019s greatest concentration of unique plant and animal species can be found in [[Madagascar]].  These species have been historically threatened by rapid population growth leading to deforestation. USAID/Madagascar planned for the development of an innovative population and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] program in the region that linked community-based [[natural resource management]] with interventions to improve [[family health]] and planning while allowing for better preservation of the island\u2019s unique biodiversity. The program had worked with local communities in order to support family planning services, [[sustainable agriculture]], good governance, improved food production, alternative livelihoods, and [[environmental education]].\n\n'''Community-Centered Conservation Efforts in Tanzania'''\nThe [[Jane Goodall Institute]], with funding from USAID/[[Tanzania]], constructed the TACARE project to eliminate [[poverty]] and support sustainable livelihoods, while alleviating the depletion of natural resources in the country. The community-based approach aimed to improve the livelihoods in Tanzanian communities while promoting conservation and an understanding of the need to preserve biodiversity. This approach provides family planning methods, information, and counseling by community volunteers that has resulted in a greater acceptance of family planning. With funding from USAID/Washington the TACARE approach is being replicated in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].\n\n'''Andean Highlands of Ecuador'''\nA collaborative operations research effort by CEMOPLAF, [[World Neighbors]], and the [[University of Michigan]]\u2019s Population-Environment Fellows Program was supported by USAID. The study showed quantified benefits of integrating family planning efforts and information with [[agriculture]] and natural resource management in the area.\n\n\"Conservation Through Public Health\"\nWith funding from USAID, Conservation Through Public Health, a Ugandan-based NGO and US registered non-profit added family planning to its integrated One Health program promoting wildlife health and community-based health care to prevent zoonotic disease transmission between people, wildlife and livestock.

They have complex kinship ties that connect their social life and cultural events to different families and neighboring nations.\n\n== Historical and cultural context ==\nAn important distinction is to be made about S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh culture.  With the [[S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh history|history]] of colonization and assimilation strategies. S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh culture has been drastically changed from their pre-European contact.  Despite these attempts, their culture remains intact and thriving. Some cultural practices and customs are not done in the same fashion, but still occur. These could be things like the construction of cedar bark clothing; modern clothes are worn just like the rest of Canadian society, but the art of cedar bark weaving is still passed on and cedar bark clothing is still made.  It is important to understand that though the practices of the S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh have changed, many still continue, some the same as before, and some only slightly changed.\n\n== Architecture and dwellings ==\n[[File:Indian Village at Coal Harbour.gif|thumb|right|300px|S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh longhouses once located in 1886 at [[Coal Harbour]].]]There architecture in traditional homes is similar to Coast Salish style dwellings called a \"longhouse.\"  The housing structures are made from cedar planks, posts, and ties.  Historically extended families would live in a longhouse, with different branches of the kinship living in different quarters of the house.  Larger houses would have been built to accommodate and host large amounts of guests in ceremonies, festivals, or [[potlatch]]ing.  Typical sizes would be around 30 feet wide, 40 feet long and from 19\u201313 feet high.\n\nThe house posts on one side would stand slightly taller than the other, giving the roof a small pitch or shed look.  Within the house, these house posts would be carved into figures of ancestors depicting legendary events or other family history such as family rights in fishing, hunting, or gathering. Beams crossed the house posts, where wood planks would sit to create the roof.  Within the house, wooden platforms formed along the walls holding families living and sleeping quarters.  With this architectural style, houses could be built onto each other end to end extending the length of the longhouse.  This gave rise to the term \u2018\u2019longhouse\u2019\u2019.<ref>Stewart, Hilary. \u2018\u2019Cedar\u2019\u2019, Douglas & McIntyre Ltd & University of Washington Press, 1984. p65 {{ISBN|0-88894-437-3}}.</ref>\n\nDifferent types of homes once existed in a typical village, depending on size.  Some villages houses a few or handful of houses, where others operated with dozens of houses, all homes to many different families.  The larger longhouses were used for large potlatches or gatherings, and other longhouses were used exclusively for spiritual ceremonialism.  These are Potlatch Houses or ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>\u00e1\u1e83txw''.<ref name=\"Kolstee, Anton 1993. p98\">Kolstee, Anton. The Eagle School student dictionary of Squamish language.

The architectural style has also been incorporated into modern buildings in the communities.\n\n==Clothing==\nThe furs of animals such as marmots, mink, weasels, and squirrels, were used for clothing. They would also use unicorn horns to stab me spleen.\n\n== Ceremonies and events ==\nIn S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh culture, ceremonies, events and festivals were the highly of community life.  Ranging from community gathers in feasts, to spiritual endeavours in ceremony, these events were a big part of the culture.  The most studied and practiced event was the potlatch.  It is important to note that a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch differed quite differently from the Northern tribes and their festivities.  In a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch, a large feast is held and the community, nation, or neighboring nations are invited to partake.  Highly wealthy families and individuals host these potlatch for different events taking place, and to distribute the resources and wealth accumulated.  A [[potlatch]] would usually occur around events such as birth, coming of age, naming ceremony, marriage, or memorial event for the deceased.  It is in the winter months that most potlatching take places, where historically summer was used for traveling and harvesting.\n\n=== Potlatch ===\n{{main|Potlatch}}\nAt a potlatch, in their language a ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>'', the host would invite guests to feast in foods prepared and harvested.  Blankets would be bought or made, then distributed to guests.  At the events, the host would hire a speaker to speak for the family in the proceedings.  For special potlatches, a special platform would be constructed, around 10 or 15 feet high, 5 feet wide, where the host and his speaker would pile a number of blankets, either bought or made by the hosts own family, and distribute the blankets to the guest.  The speaker would call out names of guests, usually highly respected or high ranking, taking a blanket and throwing it out for that guest.  Typically a crowd would amass below, ready for the falling blankets, waiting for it to fall.  While the blanket came down, the other guests would have knives and spears ready to tear apart the blanket.  Thus, the blanket would be torn and split up into multiple pieces.  After attended a few potlatches, the guests would procure enough wool to construct their own blanket.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=190, 266, 267}} \"Hundred Dollar Charlie,\" maternal grandfather to [[Andy Paull]], reportedly gave the last potlatch on [[Burrard Inlet]] before it was banned by the Canadian government in 1885.\n\nIn other ceremonies, a young woman, sometimes the daughter of a highly respected man, would be placed on top of a mound of blankets.  This mound would match her height.  Sitting on top of the blankets, a ceremony would take place around here, while she sat on top of and her family nearby.  During some ceremonies, people situated around the house would take wooden batons and beat on plank drums situated through the house.  When a young girl would stand up, she would dance around the house with a shawl on, and everyone else would beat and sing.  When she was done, one man would take [[Down feather|down]], from [[duck]], [[swan]], or [[eagle]], and sprinkle it over her.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=266, 267}}\n\nFor large festivities, a bigger house then the normal dwelling would be built. These are potlatch houses or ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>\u00e1\u1e83txw''.<ref name=\"Kolstee, Anton 1993. p98\"/>  One longhouse was measured at 200 feet long by 60 feet wide.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p46\"/> These houses could hold over a thousand guests, invited from far along the coast.  The house would be decorated with down, sprinkled throughout the floor of the house.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|p=267}}  The longhouse in [[Xwemelch'stn]] is one of these types of houses.  One potlatch was recorded at [[Xw\u00e1\u00fdxway|<u>X</u>w\u00e1\u00fd<u>x</u>way]] in 1875.  In the longhouse, a large cedar slab dwelling, a large ceremony with guests of people from nearby nations, [[Vancouver Island]], and the Interior British Columbia.  This potlatch was hosted by [[August Jack]]'s father, named Supple Jack.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p43\"/>\n\n=== Puberty and rites of passage ===\nThe stage of life that brought much change was filled with much attention and celebration.  Young men and women may follow some of the same customs, but differ on certain specifics.  The difference in their training had to do with what positions they would be taking in the community, the fact that different families had different protocols, or other factors.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p37. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nAt the sign of reaching this point in a young girl's life, she would inform her mother, and she would inform the father.  The father would call together the family and relatives.  They would then discuss what arrangements and course they would follow.  Different families had different teachings or traditions, and as such, each girl may have had different customs. In one example of the tradition, the family would take two strands of mountain goat wool, and tie them to each side of the girl's forehead.  The community would see this signifier of her new womanhood, announcing to her people that she is of age.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>\n\nFor four days, she would fast with no food and limited or no water.  During this time, she would refrain from bathing and being near fires.  It was believed if she was to go near the fire, her skin would become red.  The women of her family, like her mother, grandmother or other women, would pull out the irregular hairs from the edges of her eyebrows to make them fine and beautiful.  The edges were rubbed with the girl's saliva and a plant mixture to stop hairs from growing again.  After the four days, the same woman would bathe and scrub her.\n\nThe purpose of these traditions were to make her \"bright and smart\".<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>   Following the bathing, she would be given food and could then sit near the fire.  When applicable, a family member would drape a blanket over the woman's shoulders.  After the meal, she would be painted with red ochre.  She would travel to the forest and pull down cedar and spruce tree branches, rubbing the ends of these over her face and body.  This would to make her beautiful and charming in the eyes of men.  She would give offerings of fern roots to those cedar trees.\n\nAfter all these things were conducted, she would be given an ancestral name, and the naming ceremony or potlatch would occur.\n\n=== Naming ===\nNaming customs are ancestral or hereditary naming.  Within the traditional customs, when a child is born the elders of the child's family or community would choose a name.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p42 {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  This is called a ''ninamin'' or ''nicknam'' used to name children.  Years later while going through puberty or \"coming-of-age\" rituals, the person would receive a name from a deceased ancestor.  These ancestral names can then be traced back many generations.  The names are thus considered \"property\", in belonging to a family.  These ancestral names are called \"kweshamin\".  The family would host a potlatch and bestow the new ancestral name on the person.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\"/> Within present practices, ancestral names are still passed on, but mostly when a family makes the preparations to host a potlatch and not just when a child begins puberty.\n\nEvery name has a suffix ending, denoting masculine or feminine names, and sometimes having actual translations to their meaning.  One example is the ''-lanexw'' ending.  This is found in names like \"Kiyapalanexw\" which when Anglicized became \"Capilano\", \"Xatsalanxw\" which when Anglicized became \"Kitsilano\", and many other names.\n\n=== Marriage ===\nAfter a young boy or girl went through the proper \"coming-of-age\" rituals, or had reached puberty, they were ready to become adults.  For young people around this age, marriage would be a priority.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p40. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  A young man would search out a prospective bride from another village or sometimes a neighboring nation.  He would travel to the house of the prospective bride, sit outside the doorway with a blanket wrapped around him, and wait.  He would wait here, not eating any foods or eating any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days.  While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If acceptable to the parents, the mother of the prospective wife would approach a neighbor to inform the young man that the girl's parents are willing to accept him as their son-in-law.\n\nNeither the girl's family nor the young lover would have any communication with each other.  The neighbor would prepare and give a meal to the fasting lover.  He would then return home to his village and family to inform them of his acceptance.  He would return days later with family and friends in canoes.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If of lower ranking, he would return with one canoe load of blankets, but if of higher ranking, he would come with many canoe loads of gifts, blankets, and animal skins.  All of these gifts would be distributed to the bride's family.  Sometimes, the young man was not accepted by the young woman's family.  A family council would be held to discuss the issue, and the young man might be rejected.  A neighbor would be called upon to be an intermediary and inform him he is not invited into the house and to return home.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p41. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nDuring the night, the father-in-law would entertain the groom's family, and offer accommodation to them, with the host family sleeping on one side of the longhouse, and the groom's family living on the other.  In the proceeding morning, both families would walk down to the beach front where the groom's canoe is moored.  Here the bride's family placed blankets in the canoe.  If the bride was of high rank or nobility, blankets would be lined up on the ground from the house to the canoe for the bride to walk on, while two older women led her down.  The bride would be dressed in beautiful regalia in colours and ornaments.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  Over her head another blanket was placed, somewhat like a veil.  Behind her would be carried personal belongings, such as things like mats, baskets, blankets, wooden platters, and spoons.\n\nThe older women then placed the bride on the bow of the canoe, and for their services the groom thanked them with gifts or blankets.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\"/>  The bride's family and friends then returned to their home, while the young groom and his family returned to his village with the bride.  If the family were not of nobility, most of these customs would not occur.\n\nAfter some days, the bride and groom would return to the woman's village with the father-of-the-bride hosting a feast for his guests.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  After this feast, the married couple and family returned to their home. Many days later, the bride's family traveled to the groom's village. They would bring gifts and blankets equal the number given to them. They distributed this all to the groom's friends and family, and celebrated with a large potlatch.  During the potlatch, the bride would be placed on top of many blankets piled high, and would sit there during the ceremonies and speeches.  Gifts would be given away, and the family and village would celebrate.  After all these, the marriage ceremonies would end and the man and woman were regarded as husband and wife.\n\n== Games and sports ==\nS\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh daily life included an array of games and sports.  One of the most well known games played was the bone game or [[slahal]]. This was played with two opposing teams. There were two sets of \"bones\", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of \"bones\". When your team was guessing, your objective was to get the right bone, the one without the stripe. When you had the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed wrong on the bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around from hand to hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match. Placing bets on teams, or individual matches within the game between one guess and the other teams bone hiders.\n\nOther games included some played by children, and some played specifically by the warriors to prepare and train themselves.  Some sports are similar to modern-day lacrosse, rugby, and soccer.\n\nThe S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh game called {{not a typo|t<u>k</u>'7kw'ala}}, similar to lacrosse, was played in villages.  A smooth oval stone weighing about three pounds, would be used by teams of two, around six on each team.  There were no sticks or nets on open spaces.  The goal posts were six feet apart on each side of an open space.\n\nIn the last few decades, canoe racing has become popular among [[Coast Salish peoples]].  It's done with specifically designed war canoes or racing canoes.  They are based on the more traditional canoe styles, but have quite a modern design.  The canoe is usually a foot or two above water level, with enough width for one man.  Different races include single, double, or 11-man races.  The races are held in the summertime.\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Squamish language}}\nThe [[Squamish language]], or S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language, is the ancestral language of the S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh people.  It is considered an important part of cultural revitalization.  Although nearing [[language extinction]], it's still used in ceremonies, events, and basic conversation among some.  With the language dead (no children are learning it as a first language and all language speakers are over the age of 65), much work is being done to preserve and revitalize it.  The language is part the [[Coast Salish]] linguistic group, and is most closely related to [[Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh language|Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh]] (Sechelt), and S\u1e35'emin'em ([[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]]) and Xwsa7km ([[Nooksack language|Lh\u00e9chalosem]]).  Many anthropologists and linguists have worked with S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh people and their language, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Charles Hill-Tout]], [[Homer Barnett]], and [[Aert J. Kuipers]].\n\nSince the late 1800s the language has had a history.  Before contact, it was the prominent language of all the villages, along with the [[Chinook Jargon]].  Most children would learn Chinook as a first language because it was so basic, then S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh language as they became older.  After the spread of diseases causing massive population drops and colonizations of their territory, Chinook became a minority language in their lands.  When the Canadian government enforced [[assimilationist]] policies regarding their culture and language, a [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] was set up in the village of [[Eslha7an]] with children coming from many Skwxwu7mesh villages, plus some church officials sending children to another school in [[Sechelt]].  The school, a home for many children 10 months out of the year, were forbade to speak their language.  Any children speaking the language were punished and beaten.  This cause a deep resentment about speaking the language, and so the next generation grew up without any knowledge of their native tongue.\n\nOver the years, English became the prominent language.  Then during the 1960s, a great deal of documentation and work helped in its revitalization.  The BC Language Project with Randy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy undertook more documentation and were the main collaborators on this project. They devised the present writing system that is used for the S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language.  Eventually a local [[elementary school]] and [[high school]] included language classes, as opposed to the normal [[French language]] option.   Xwemelch'stn Estimxwataxw School, meaning ''Xwmelch'stn Littleones School'', with grades Kindergarten to 3, was built to assist in [[language immersion]], with plans to expand it into a full immersion school.<ref>Lancaster, Deanna.

The architectural style has also been incorporated into modern buildings in the communities.\n\n==Clothing==\nThe furs of animals such as marmots, mink, weasels, and squirrels, were used for clothing.\n\n== Ceremonies and events ==\nIn S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh culture, ceremonies, events and festivals were the highly of community life.  Ranging from community gathers in feasts, to spiritual endeavours in ceremony, these events were a big part of the culture.  The most studied and practiced event was the potlatch.  It is important to note that a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch differed quite differently from the Northern tribes and their festivities.  In a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch, a large feast is held and the community, nation, or neighboring nations are invited to partake.  Highly wealthy families and individuals host these potlatch for different events taking place, and to distribute the resources and wealth accumulated.  A [[potlatch]] would usually occur around events such as birth, coming of age, naming ceremony, marriage, or memorial event for the deceased.  It is in the winter months that most potlatching take places, where historically summer was used for traveling and harvesting.\n\n=== Potlatch ===\n{{main|Potlatch}}\nAt a potlatch, in their language a ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>'', the host would invite guests to feast in foods prepared and harvested.  Blankets would be bought or made, then distributed to guests.  At the events, the host would hire a speaker to speak for the family in the proceedings.  For special potlatches, a special platform would be constructed, around 10 or 15 feet high, 5 feet wide, where the host and his speaker would pile a number of blankets, either bought or made by the hosts own family, and distribute the blankets to the guest.  The speaker would call out names of guests, usually highly respected or high ranking, taking a blanket and throwing it out for that guest.  Typically a crowd would amass below, ready for the falling blankets, waiting for it to fall.  While the blanket came down, the other guests would have knives and spears ready to tear apart the blanket.  Thus, the blanket would be torn and split up into multiple pieces.  After attended a few potlatches, the guests would procure enough wool to construct their own blanket.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=190, 266, 267}} \"Hundred Dollar Charlie,\" maternal grandfather to [[Andy Paull]], reportedly gave the last potlatch on [[Burrard Inlet]] before it was banned by the Canadian government in 1885.\n\nIn other ceremonies, a young woman, sometimes the daughter of a highly respected man, would be placed on top of a mound of blankets.  This mound would match her height.  Sitting on top of the blankets, a ceremony would take place around here, while she sat on top of and her family nearby.  During some ceremonies, people situated around the house would take wooden batons and beat on plank drums situated through the house.  When a young girl would stand up, she would dance around the house with a shawl on, and everyone else would beat and sing.  When she was done, one man would take [[Down feather|down]], from [[duck]], [[swan]], or [[eagle]], and sprinkle it over her.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=266, 267}}\n\nFor large festivities, a bigger house then the normal dwelling would be built. These are potlatch houses or ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>\u00e1\u1e83txw''.<ref name=\"Kolstee, Anton 1993. p98\"/>  One longhouse was measured at 200 feet long by 60 feet wide.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p46\"/> These houses could hold over a thousand guests, invited from far along the coast.  The house would be decorated with down, sprinkled throughout the floor of the house.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|p=267}}  The longhouse in [[Xwemelch'stn]] is one of these types of houses.  One potlatch was recorded at [[Xw\u00e1\u00fdxway|<u>X</u>w\u00e1\u00fd<u>x</u>way]] in 1875.  In the longhouse, a large cedar slab dwelling, a large ceremony with guests of people from nearby nations, [[Vancouver Island]], and the Interior British Columbia.  This potlatch was hosted by [[August Jack]]'s father, named Supple Jack.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p43\"/>\n\n=== Puberty and rites of passage ===\nThe stage of life that brought much change was filled with much attention and celebration.  Young men and women may follow some of the same customs, but differ on certain specifics.  The difference in their training had to do with what positions they would be taking in the community, the fact that different families had different protocols, or other factors.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p37. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nAt the sign of reaching this point in a young girl's life, she would inform her mother, and she would inform the father.  The father would call together the family and relatives.  They would then discuss what arrangements and course they would follow.  Different families had different teachings or traditions, and as such, each girl may have had different customs. In one example of the tradition, the family would take two strands of mountain goat wool, and tie them to each side of the girl's forehead.  The community would see this signifier of her new womanhood, announcing to her people that she is of age.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>\n\nFor four days, she would fast with no food and limited or no water.  During this time, she would refrain from bathing and being near fires.  It was believed if she was to go near the fire, her skin would become red.  The women of her family, like her mother, grandmother or other women, would pull out the irregular hairs from the edges of her eyebrows to make them fine and beautiful.  The edges were rubbed with the girl's saliva and a plant mixture to stop hairs from growing again.  After the four days, the same woman would bathe and scrub her.\n\nThe purpose of these traditions were to make her \"bright and smart\".<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>   Following the bathing, she would be given food and could then sit near the fire.  When applicable, a family member would drape a blanket over the woman's shoulders.  After the meal, she would be painted with red ochre.  She would travel to the forest and pull down cedar and spruce tree branches, rubbing the ends of these over her face and body.  This would to make her beautiful and charming in the eyes of men.  She would give offerings of fern roots to those cedar trees.\n\nAfter all these things were conducted, she would be given an ancestral name, and the naming ceremony or potlatch would occur.\n\n=== Naming ===\nNaming customs are ancestral or hereditary naming.  Within the traditional customs, when a child is born the elders of the child's family or community would choose a name.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p42 {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  This is called a ''ninamin'' or ''nicknam'' used to name children.  Years later while going through puberty or \"coming-of-age\" rituals, the person would receive a name from a deceased ancestor.  These ancestral names can then be traced back many generations.  The names are thus considered \"property\", in belonging to a family.  These ancestral names are called \"kweshamin\".  The family would host a potlatch and bestow the new ancestral name on the person.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\"/> Within present practices, ancestral names are still passed on, but mostly when a family makes the preparations to host a potlatch and not just when a child begins puberty.\n\nEvery name has a suffix ending, denoting masculine or feminine names, and sometimes having actual translations to their meaning.  One example is the ''-lanexw'' ending.  This is found in names like \"Kiyapalanexw\" which when Anglicized became \"Capilano\", \"Xatsalanxw\" which when Anglicized became \"Kitsilano\", and many other names.\n\n=== Marriage ===\nAfter a young boy or girl went through the proper \"coming-of-age\" rituals, or had reached puberty, they were ready to become adults.  For young people around this age, marriage would be a priority.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p40. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  A young man would search out a prospective bride from another village or sometimes a neighboring nation.  He would travel to the house of the prospective bride, sit outside the doorway with a blanket wrapped around him, and wait.  He would wait here, not eating any foods or eating any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days.  While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If acceptable to the parents, the mother of the prospective wife would approach a neighbor to inform the young man that the girl's parents are willing to accept him as their son-in-law.\n\nNeither the girl's family nor the young lover would have any communication with each other.  The neighbor would prepare and give a meal to the fasting lover.  He would then return home to his village and family to inform them of his acceptance.  He would return days later with family and friends in canoes.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If of lower ranking, he would return with one canoe load of blankets, but if of higher ranking, he would come with many canoe loads of gifts, blankets, and animal skins.  All of these gifts would be distributed to the bride's family.  Sometimes, the young man was not accepted by the young woman's family.  A family council would be held to discuss the issue, and the young man might be rejected.  A neighbor would be called upon to be an intermediary and inform him he is not invited into the house and to return home.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p41. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nDuring the night, the father-in-law would entertain the groom's family, and offer accommodation to them, with the host family sleeping on one side of the longhouse, and the groom's family living on the other.  In the proceeding morning, both families would walk down to the beach front where the groom's canoe is moored.  Here the bride's family placed blankets in the canoe.  If the bride was of high rank or nobility, blankets would be lined up on the ground from the house to the canoe for the bride to walk on, while two older women led her down.  The bride would be dressed in beautiful regalia in colours and ornaments.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  Over her head another blanket was placed, somewhat like a veil.  Behind her would be carried personal belongings, such as things like mats, baskets, blankets, wooden platters, and spoons.\n\nThe older women then placed the bride on the bow of the canoe, and for their services the groom thanked them with gifts or blankets.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\"/>  The bride's family and friends then returned to their home, while the young groom and his family returned to his village with the bride.  If the family were not of nobility, most of these customs would not occur.\n\nAfter some days, the bride and groom would return to the woman's village with the father-of-the-bride hosting a feast for his guests.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  After this feast, the married couple and family returned to their home. Many days later, the bride's family traveled to the groom's village. They would bring gifts and blankets equal the number given to them. They distributed this all to the groom's friends and family, and celebrated with a large potlatch.  During the potlatch, the bride would be placed on top of many blankets piled high, and would sit there during the ceremonies and speeches.  Gifts would be given away, and the family and village would celebrate.  After all these, the marriage ceremonies would end and the man and woman were regarded as husband and wife.\n\n== Games and sports ==\nS\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh daily life included an array of games and sports.  One of the most well known games played was the bone game or [[slahal]]. This was played with two opposing teams. There were two sets of \"bones\", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of \"bones\". When your team was guessing, your objective was to get the right bone, the one without the stripe. When you had the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed wrong on the bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around from hand to hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match. Placing bets on teams, or individual matches within the game between one guess and the other teams bone hiders.\n\nOther games included some played by children, and some played specifically by the warriors to prepare and train themselves.  Some sports are similar to modern-day lacrosse, rugby, and soccer.\n\nThe S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh game called {{not a typo|t<u>k</u>'7kw'ala}}, similar to lacrosse, was played in villages.  A smooth oval stone weighing about three pounds, would be used by teams of two, around six on each team.  There were no sticks or nets on open spaces.  The goal posts were six feet apart on each side of an open space.\n\nIn the last few decades, canoe racing has become popular among [[Coast Salish peoples]].  It's done with specifically designed war canoes or racing canoes.  They are based on the more traditional canoe styles, but have quite a modern design.  The canoe is usually a foot or two above water level, with enough width for one man.  Different races include single, double, or 11-man races.  The races are held in the summertime.\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Squamish language}}\nThe [[Squamish language]], or S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language, is the ancestral language of the S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh people.  It is considered an important part of cultural revitalization.  Although nearing [[language extinction]], it's still used in ceremonies, events, and basic conversation among some.  With the language dead (no children are learning it as a first language and all language speakers are over the age of 65), much work is being done to preserve and revitalize it.  The language is part the [[Coast Salish]] linguistic group, and is most closely related to [[Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh language|Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh]] (Sechelt), and S\u1e35'emin'em ([[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]]) and Xwsa7km ([[Nooksack language|Lh\u00e9chalosem]]).  Many anthropologists and linguists have worked with S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh people and their language, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Charles Hill-Tout]], [[Homer Barnett]], and [[Aert J. Kuipers]].\n\nSince the late 1800s the language has had a history.  Before contact, it was the prominent language of all the villages, along with the [[Chinook Jargon]].  Most children would learn Chinook as a first language because it was so basic, then S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh language as they became older.  After the spread of diseases causing massive population drops and colonizations of their territory, Chinook became a minority language in their lands.  When the Canadian government enforced [[assimilationist]] policies regarding their culture and language, a [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] was set up in the village of [[Eslha7an]] with children coming from many Skwxwu7mesh villages, plus some church officials sending children to another school in [[Sechelt]].  The school, a home for many children 10 months out of the year, were forbade to speak their language.  Any children speaking the language were punished and beaten.  This cause a deep resentment about speaking the language, and so the next generation grew up without any knowledge of their native tongue.\n\nOver the years, English became the prominent language.  Then during the 1960s, a great deal of documentation and work helped in its revitalization.  The BC Language Project with Randy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy undertook more documentation and were the main collaborators on this project. They devised the present writing system that is used for the S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language.  Eventually a local [[elementary school]] and [[high school]] included language classes, as opposed to the normal [[French language]] option.   Xwemelch'stn Estimxwataxw School, meaning ''Xwmelch'stn Littleones School'', with grades Kindergarten to 3, was built to assist in [[language immersion]], with plans to expand it into a full immersion school.<ref>Lancaster, Deanna.
