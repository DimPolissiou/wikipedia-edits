The engraving is large at 42.4 x 60.9&nbsp;cm, and depicts five men wearing headbands and five men without, fighting in pairs with weapons in front of a dense background of vegetation. \n\nAll the figures are posed in different strained and athletic positions, and the print is advanced for the period in this respect. The style is classicizing, although they grimace fiercely, and their musculature is strongly emphasized.  The two figures nearest the front of the picture space are in essentially the same pose, seen from in front and behind, and one purpose of the print may have been to give artists poses to copy. An effective and largely original return-stroke engraving technique was employed to model the bodies, with delicate and subtle effect.\n\n==Context and reception==\n[[Vasari]], who praises the engraving highly, says that Pollaiuolo made other prints, but none have survived. Given the rarity of this one, Vasari may well be right, although he was writing many decades later. Alternatively he may have been referring to a number of prints after paintings or drawings of Pollaiuolo, but now universally seen as engraved by different artists to the battle, and now mostly attributed as \"School of Pollaiuolo\" or similar terms.\n[[Image:Herkules und Ant\u00e4us (Mantegna).jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Hercules]] and [[Antaeus]]'', [[engraving]] 1490-1500, School of Mantegna]]\n\nAs with [[Andrea Mantegna]], the dominant Italian printmaker of the period, based mostly in [[Mantua]], the suggestion has been made that Pollaiuolo may not have engraved the plate himself, but hired a specialist to work from his design.  However this remains a minority view.<ref>See Zucker:16</ref>  Engraving was an essential skill of the goldsmith, and Pollaiuolo's workshop produced [[niello]] engraved plaques. Estimates of the date of the engraving have varied from about 1465 to about 1489.<ref>Langdale:51</ref> As with most famous prints of the period, a number of direct copies were made in engraving and [[woodcut]],<ref>Illus Langdale:6,7</ref> including one by \"Johannes of Frankfurt\" in about 1490,<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1346020&partid=1 British Museum] Johannes of Frankfurt copy]</ref> and it was often borrowed from and imitated, for example in a [[drawing]] probably by [[Raphael]].

Mantegna made two large engravings of the ''Battle of the Sea-Gods'', and he or his followers produced a number of others of male nudes fighting under various classical titles.  Despite the usual attempts by [[art historian]]s, including in this case [[Erwin Panofsky]], to identify a specific subject for the engraving, it is likely none was intended.<ref>The fullest account is in Levinson:66-71.

Despite this, neither the system nor its predecessors have been used in this manner, due to the [[24-hour news cycle|ubiquity of news coverage]] in these situations.

The [[Integrated Public Alert and Warning System]] (IPAWS) is used as a backend to distribute alert information via EAS and related technologies such as [[Wireless Emergency Alerts]] (WEA), using [[Common Alerting Protocol]] (CAP).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system |title=Integrated Public Alert & Warning System |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=September 18, 2018 |website=fema.gov |publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency |access-date=September 22, 2018 |quote=IPAWS provides public safety officials with an effective way to alert and warn the public about serious emergencies using the Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems from a single interface.}}</ref> EAS messages are transmitted primarily via terrestrial and satellite [[radio]] and television (including [[Terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[multichannel television]]), which are required to participate in the system.<ref>{{cite web |title= Federal Register 76220 |volume= 71 |number=244 |date= December 20, 2006 |work= Federal Communications Commission |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2006-12-20/pdf/E6-21770.pdf#page=1}}</ref>\n\n==Technical concept==\n{{Main|Specific Area Message Encoding}}\nMessages in the EAS are composed of four parts: a digitally encoded [[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME) [[header (computing)|header]], an attention signal, an audio announcement, and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker.\n\n[[File:Sage EAS Endec.jpg|right|thumb|A Sage EAS ENDEC unit]]\nThe {{Audio|Same.wav|SAME header}} is the most critical part of the EAS design. It contains information about who originated the alert (the president, state or local authorities, the [[National Weather Service]] (NOAA/NWS), or the broadcaster), a short, general description of the event (tornado, flood, severe thunderstorm), the areas affected (up to 32 counties or states), the expected duration of the event (in minutes), the date and time it was issued (in [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]]), and an identification of the originating station (see [[Specific Area Message Encoding|SAME]] for a complete breakdown of the header).\n\nThere are 77 radio stations designated as National Primary Stations in the Primary Entry Point (PEP) System to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems.<ref name=\"The National Public Warning System\">{{cite news |url=https://www.fema.gov/national-public-warning-system |title=The National Public Warning System |work=FEMA.gov |date=May 12, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Emergency Action Notification]] is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the United States or their designee will deliver a message over the EAS via the PEP system.<ref>{{cite conference | title=Emergency Alert System 2001 AM & FM Handbook | booktitle=Emergency Alert System 2001 AM & FM Handbook | pages=4 | publisher=United States Federal Communications Commission | year=2001 | location=United States}}</ref> The government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23240430 | work=BBC News | title=Emergency broadcasts can be hacked, US researchers say | date=July 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/39hello-this-is-your-president39|title='Hello, This Is Your President'|date=2010-02-02|website=Radio World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref>\n\n===Primary Entry Point stations===\nThe National Public Warning System, also known as the '''Primary Entry Point''' (PEP) stations, are a network of 77 radio stations that are, in coordination with FEMA, used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during, and after incidents and disasters. PEP stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event. Beginning with [[WJR]]/Detroit and [[WLW]]/Cincinnati in 2016, FEMA began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 PEP stations, which feature broadcasting equipment, emergency provisions, a rest area, and an air filtration system. NPWS project manager Manny Centeno explained that these shelters were designed to \"[expand] the survivability of these stations to include an all hazards platform, which means chemical, biological, radiological air protection and protection from electromagnetic pulse.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/wlw-pep-station-to-test-new-studio-shelter|title=WLW PEP Station to Test New Studio Shelter|date=2018-10-22|website=Radio World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioink.com/2018/10/22/fema-upgrading-wlw/|title=FEMA Upgrading WLW|date=2018-10-22|website=Radio Ink|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideradio.com/free/in-hardening-eas-lynchpins-fema-puts-confidence-in-radio/article_890c20a4-d824-11e8-8a9f-d33e31890575.html|title=In Hardening EAS Lynchpins, FEMA Puts Confidence In Radio.|website=Insideradio.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\n===Communication links===\nThe FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) \"Provides Primary Entry Point service to the Emergency Alert System\", and acts as an emergency presidential link into the EAS.

This process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system.\n\nEach EAS participant is required to monitor at least two other participants.\n\n===EAS header===\nBecause the header lacks error detection codes, it is repeated three times for redundancy. EAS decoders compare the received headers against one another, looking for an exact match between any two, eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail. The decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station (following parameters set by the broadcaster).\n\nThe SAME header bursts are followed by an attention tone, which lasts between 8 and 25 seconds, depending on the originating station. The tone is {{Audio|1050Hz Tone.ogg|1050&nbsp;Hz}} on a [[NOAA Weather Radio]] station. On commercial broadcast stations, a {{Audio|Emergency Alert System Attention Signal 20s.ogg|\"two-tone\"}} attention signal of 853&nbsp;[[Hertz (frequency)|Hz]] and 960&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]s is used instead, the same signal used by the older [[Emergency Broadcast System]]. These tones have become infamous, and can be considered both frightening and annoying by viewers; in fact, the two tones, which form approximately the interval of a just [[major second]] at an unusually high pitch, were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention, due to their unpleasantness on the [[human ear]]. The SAME header is equally known for its shrillness, which many have found to be startling. The \"two-tone\" system is no longer required as of 1998, and is to be used only for audio alerts before EAS messages.<ref name=\"cfr47\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2013-title47-vol1/pdf/CFR-2013-title47-vol1-sec11-61.pdf | title=United States Code of Federal Regulations - 47 CFR 11.61 - Tests of EAS procedures | publisher=access.gpo.gov | date=}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=April 2011}} Like the EBS, the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert.\n\nThe message ends with 3 bursts of the [[Audio frequency-shift keying|AFSK]] \"EOM\", or [[End of Message]], which is the text <tt>NNNN</tt>, preceded each time by the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 10101011 calibration.\n\n=== IPAWS ===\n[[File:GormanCAPconverter.jpg|300px|upright=1.5|right|thumb|A Gorman-Redlich [[rack mounted]] [[Common Alerting Protocol|CAP]]-to-EAS converter which translates CAP formatted alerts into SAME headers.]]\nUnder a 2006 executive order issued by [[George W. Bush]], the U.S. government was instructed to create \"an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive\" public warning system. This was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned PEP network, and the development of the [[Integrated Public Alert and Warning System]] (IPAWS)\u2014a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the [[XML]]-based [[Common Alerting Protocol]] (CAP) and an internet network.

These decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for EAS messages. For reliability, at least two source stations must be monitored, one of which must be a designated ''local primary''.

At first, all but three of the events (civil emergency message, immediate evacuation, and emergency action notification [national emergency]) were weather-related (such as a [[tornado warning]]). Since then, several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added, including, in most states, the [[AMBER Alert]] System for child abduction emergencies.  In 2016, three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events, including Extreme Wind Warning (EWW), Storm Surge Warning (SSW) and Storm Surge Watch (SSA).\n\nIn 2004, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) seeking comment on whether EAS in its present form is the most effective mechanism for warning the American public of an emergency and, if not, on how EAS can be improved, such as mandatory text messages to cellphones, regardless of subscription. As noted above, rules implemented by the FCC on July 12, 2007 provisionally endorse incorporating CAP with the SAME protocol.\n\nIn 2018, Hawaii Senator [[Brian Schatz]] proposed the Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement (READI) Act; alongside proposing that FEMA create best practices for EAS usage and false alarms (the latter in response to the [[2018 Hawaii false missile alert|Hawaii false missile alert]]), it would have required that certain types of alerts receive repeat broadcasts in order to ensure that viewers receive the alert.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/sens-schatz-and-thune-introduce-readi-act-to-improve-eas|title=Sens.

However, several consumer-level radios do exist, especially [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]] [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], which are available to the public through both [[mail-order]] and [[retailer]]s. Other specialty receivers for AM/FM/ACSSB (LM) are available only through mail-order, or in some places from federal, state, or local [[government]]s, especially where there is a potential hazard nearby such as a chemical factory. These radios come pre-tuned to a station in each area that has agreed to provide this service to local emergency management officials and agencies, often with a direct link back to the plant's safety system or control room for instant activation should an evacuation or other emergency arise.\n\nThe ability to narrow messages down so that only the actual area in danger is alerted is extremely helpful in preventing false warnings, which was previously a major tune-out factor. Instead of sounding for all warnings within a station's area, SAME-decoder radios now sound only for the counties for which they are programmed. When the alarm sounds, anyone with the radio ''knows'' that the danger is nearby and protective action should be taken. For this reason, the goal of the National Weather Service is that each home should have both a [[smoke detector]] and a SAME [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]].\n\n==Limitations==\nThe EAS can only be used to relay audio messages that preempt all programming; as the intent of an Emergency Action Notification is to serve as a \"last-ditch effort to get a message out if the [p]resident cannot get to the media\", it can easily be made redundant by the [[24-hour news cycle|immediate and constant coverage]] that major weather events and other newsworthy situations\u2014such as, most prominently, the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001\u2014receive from television broadcasters and [[news channel]]s.

It is jointly coordinated by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). The EAS regulations and standards are governed by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau of the FCC.\n\nAs with its predecessors, the system is primarily designed to allow the [[President of the United States|president]] to address the country via all radio and television stations, in the event of a national emergency. Despite this, neither the system nor its predecessors have been used in this manner, due to the [[24-hour news cycle|ubiquity of news coverage]] in these situations. In practice, it is more commonly used to distribute information regarding imminent threats to public safety, such as severe weather situations (including [[flash flood]]s and [[tornado]]es), [[AMBER Alert]]s of child abductions, and other civic emergencies.\n\nAuthorized organizations are able to disseminate and coordinate emergency alerts and warning messages through EAS. The [[Integrated Public Alert and Warning System]] (IPAWS) is used as a backend to distribute alert information via EAS and related technologies such as [[Wireless Emergency Alerts]] (WEA), using [[Common Alerting Protocol]] (CAP).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system |title=Integrated Public Alert & Warning System |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=September 18, 2018 |website=fema.gov |publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency |access-date=September 22, 2018 |quote=IPAWS provides public safety officials with an effective way to alert and warn the public about serious emergencies using the Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems from a single interface.}}</ref> EAS messages are transmitted primarily via terrestrial and satellite [[radio]] and television (including [[Terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[multichannel television]]), which are required to participate in the system.<ref>{{cite web |title= Federal Register 76220 |volume= 71 |number=244 |date= December 20, 2006 |work= Federal Communications Commission |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2006-12-20/pdf/E6-21770.pdf#page=1}}</ref>\n\n==Technical concept==\n{{Main|Specific Area Message Encoding}}\nMessages in the EAS are composed of four parts: a digitally encoded [[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME) [[header (computing)|header]], an attention signal, an audio announcement, and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker.\n\n[[File:Sage EAS Endec.jpg|right|thumb|A Sage EAS ENDEC unit]]\nThe {{Audio|Same.wav|SAME header}} is the most critical part of the EAS design.

PEP stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event. Beginning with [[WJR]]/Detroit and [[WLW]]/Cincinnati in 2016, FEMA began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 PEP stations, which feature broadcasting equipment, emergency provisions, a rest area, and an air filtration system. NPWS project manager Manny Centeno explained that these shelters were designed to \"[expand] the survivability of these stations to include an all hazards platform, which means chemical, biological, radiological air protection and protection from electromagnetic pulse.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/wlw-pep-station-to-test-new-studio-shelter|title=WLW PEP Station to Test New Studio Shelter|date=2018-10-22|website=Radio World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioink.com/2018/10/22/fema-upgrading-wlw/|title=FEMA Upgrading WLW|date=2018-10-22|website=Radio Ink|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideradio.com/free/in-hardening-eas-lynchpins-fema-puts-confidence-in-radio/article_890c20a4-d824-11e8-8a9f-d33e31890575.html|title=In Hardening EAS Lynchpins, FEMA Puts Confidence In Radio.|website=Insideradio.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\n===Communication links===\nThe FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) \"Provides Primary Entry Point service to the Emergency Alert System\", and acts as an emergency presidential link into the EAS.

This process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system.\n\nEach EAS participant is required to monitor at least two other participants.\n\n===EAS header===\nBecause the header lacks error detection codes, it is repeated three times for redundancy. EAS decoders compare the received headers against one another, looking for an exact match between any two, eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail. The decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station (following parameters set by the broadcaster).\n\nThe SAME header bursts are followed by an attention tone, which lasts between 8 and 25 seconds, depending on the originating station. The tone is {{Audio|1050Hz Tone.ogg|1050&nbsp;Hz}} on a [[NOAA Weather Radio]] station. On commercial broadcast stations, a {{Audio|Emergency Alert System Attention Signal 20s.ogg|\"two-tone\"}} attention signal of 853&nbsp;[[Hertz (frequency)|Hz]] and 960&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]s is used instead, the same signal used by the older [[Emergency Broadcast System]]. These tones have become infamous, and can be considered both frightening and annoying by viewers; in fact, the two tones, which form approximately the interval of a just [[major second]] at an unusually high pitch, were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention, due to their unpleasantness on the [[human ear]]. The SAME header is equally known for its shrillness, which many have found to be startling. The \"two-tone\" system is no longer required as of 1998, and is to be used only for audio alerts before EAS messages.<ref name=\"cfr47\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2013-title47-vol1/pdf/CFR-2013-title47-vol1-sec11-61.pdf | title=United States Code of Federal Regulations - 47 CFR 11.61 - Tests of EAS procedures | publisher=access.gpo.gov | date=}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=April 2011}} Like the EBS, the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert.\n\nThe message ends with 3 bursts of the [[Audio frequency-shift keying|AFSK]] \"EOM\", or [[End of Message]], which is the text <tt>NNNN</tt>, preceded each time by the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 10101011 calibration.\n\n=== IPAWS ===\n[[File:GormanCAPconverter.jpg|300px|upright=1.5|right|thumb|A Gorman-Redlich [[rack mounted]] [[Common Alerting Protocol|CAP]]-to-EAS converter which translates CAP formatted alerts into SAME headers.]]\nUnder a 2006 executive order issued by [[George W. Bush]], the U.S. government was instructed to create \"an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive\" public warning system. This was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned PEP network, and the development of the [[Integrated Public Alert and Warning System]] (IPAWS)\u2014a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the [[XML]]-based [[Common Alerting Protocol]] (CAP) and an internet network. IPAWS can be used to distribute alert information to EAS participants, supported mobile phones ([[Wireless Emergency Alerts]]), and other platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtech.com/em/disaster/Impact-IPAWS-Public-Alerts-Warnings.html|title=The Impact of IPAWS on Public Alerts and Warnings|website=www.govtech.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-24}}</ref>\n\nUnder an FCC report and order issued in 2007, EAS participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting CAP within 180 days of the specification's adoption by FEMA.

Therefore, broadcasters must convert CAP messages to legacy SAME headers to enable [[backwards compatibility]] with the existing \"daisy chain\" method of EAS distribution, providing a backup distribution path.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=385a5fb7-aa83-431d-80a1-3aa45296e3db|title=FCC revises emergency alert system rules; reminds participants of June 30, 2012 CAP compliance deadline|last=Oxenford|first=Davis Wright Tremaine LLP-David D.|last2=Tol|first2=Jennifer|website=Lexology.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-24|last3=Frewer}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2010/09/articles/fema-adopts-digital-message-format-for-eas-cap-standard-triggering-180-day-clock-for-compliance/|title=FEMA Adopts Digital Message Format for EAS CAP Standard, Triggering 180-Day Clock for Compliance|date=2010-09-30|website=Broadcast Law Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-24}}</ref>\n\n==Station requirements==\nThe FCC requires all broadcast stations and [[multichannel video programming distributor]]s (MVPD), hereafter \"EAS participants\", to install and maintain FCC-certified EAS decoders and encoders at their control points or [[Cable television headend|headends]]. These decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for EAS messages. For reliability, at least two source stations must be monitored, one of which must be a designated ''local primary''. Participants are to retain the latest version of the EAS handbook.\n\nEAS participants are required by federal law to relay [[Emergency Action Notification]] (EAN) messages immediately (47 CFR Part 11.54).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=763e47002785e63b94a7710dcf78869a&rgn=div8&view=text&node=47:1.0.1.1.12.4.231.4&idno=47|title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=National Archives|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529053544/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr|archivedate=May 29, 2012|accessdate=July 6, 2012|df=mdy}}</ref> Broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as [[severe weather]], and [[child abduction]] emergencies ([[AMBER Alert]]s) if they so choose (in practice, severe weather warnings are usually handled by a station's [[local news]] operation, who may interrupt programming to present coverage anchored by an [[Weather presenter|weatherman]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ohio-weatherman-fires-back-at-bachelorette-viewers-tornado-warning-1213957|title=Ohio Weatherman Fires Back at 'Bachelorette' Fans After Tornado Warning Interrupts Broadcast|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>\n\nEAS participants are required to keep logs of all received messages.

The required weekly test (RWT) consists, at a minimum, of the header and end-of-message tones. Though an RWT does not need an audio or graphic message announcing the test, many stations provide them as a courtesy to the public.

At first, all but three of the events (civil emergency message, immediate evacuation, and emergency action notification [national emergency]) were weather-related (such as a [[tornado warning]]). Since then, several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added, including, in most states, the [[AMBER Alert]] System for child abduction emergencies.  In 2016, three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events, including Extreme Wind Warning (EWW), Storm Surge Warning (SSW) and Storm Surge Watch (SSA).\n\nIn 2004, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) seeking comment on whether EAS in its present form is the most effective mechanism for warning the American public of an emergency and, if not, on how EAS can be improved, such as mandatory text messages to cellphones, regardless of subscription. As noted above, rules implemented by the FCC on July 12, 2007 provisionally endorse incorporating CAP with the SAME protocol.\n\nIn 2018, Hawaii Senator [[Brian Schatz]] proposed the Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement (READI) Act; alongside proposing that FEMA create best practices for EAS usage and false alarms (the latter in response to the [[2018 Hawaii false missile alert|Hawaii false missile alert]]), it would have required that certain types of alerts receive repeat broadcasts in order to ensure that viewers receive the alert.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/sens-schatz-and-thune-introduce-readi-act-to-improve-eas|title=Sens.

However, several consumer-level radios do exist, especially [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]] [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], which are available to the public through both [[mail-order]] and [[retailer]]s. Other specialty receivers for AM/FM/ACSSB (LM) are available only through mail-order, or in some places from federal, state, or local [[government]]s, especially where there is a potential hazard nearby such as a chemical factory. These radios come pre-tuned to a station in each area that has agreed to provide this service to local emergency management officials and agencies, often with a direct link back to the plant's safety system or control room for instant activation should an evacuation or other emergency arise.\n\nThe ability to narrow messages down so that only the actual area in danger is alerted is extremely helpful in preventing false warnings, which was previously a major tune-out factor. Instead of sounding for all warnings within a station's area, SAME-decoder radios now sound only for the counties for which they are programmed. When the alarm sounds, anyone with the radio ''knows'' that the danger is nearby and protective action should be taken. For this reason, the goal of the National Weather Service is that each home should have both a [[smoke detector]] and a SAME [[NOAA Weather Radio|weather radio]].\n\n==Limitations==\nThe EAS can only be used to relay audio messages that preempt all programming; as the intent of an Emergency Action Notification is to serve as a \"last-ditch effort to get a message out if the [p]resident cannot get to the media\", it can easily be made redundant by the [[24-hour news cycle|immediate and constant coverage]] that major weather events and other newsworthy situations\u2014such as, most prominently, the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001\u2014receive from television broadcasters and [[news channel]]s. Following the attacks, then-FCC chairman [[Michael K. Powell]] cited \"the ubiquitous media environment\" as justification for not using the EAS in their immediate aftermath. Glenn Collins of ''[[The New York Times]]'' acknowledged these limitations, noting that \"no president has ever used the current [EAS] system or its technical predecessors in the last 50 years, despite the [[Cold War|Soviet missile crisis]], a [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|presidential assassination]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], major earthquakes and three recent high-alert terrorist warnings\", and that using it would have actually hindered the availability of live coverage from media outlets.<ref name=\"Collins\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/21/nyregion/silence-alert-system-experts-urge-overhaul-plan-unused-even-sept-11.html?scp=1&sq=Emergency%20Alert%20System&st=cse | title=The Silence of the Alert System; Experts Urge Overhaul of Plan Unused Even on Sept. 11 | last=Collins | first=Glenn | date=December 21, 2001 | work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=\"rwonline\">{{cite web | last=Stine | first=Randy J. | url=http://www.rwonline.com/reference-room/special-report/rw-eas2.shtml | title=Terrorism Attacks Cue EAS Debate | work=Radio World | date=September 26, 2001 | publisher=IMAS Publishing (USA) Inc. | url-status=dead | archivedate=October 24, 2001 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011024114726/http://www.rwonline.com/reference-room/special-report/rw-eas2.shtml}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[tornado outbreak of March 3, 2019]], Birmingham, Alabama NWS meteorologist Kevin Laws told [[CNN]] that he, personally, wished that alerts could be updated in real-time in order to reflect the unpredictable nature of weather events \u2013noting that the storm system's unexpected change in trajectory towards [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]] resulted in only a nine-minute warning (the resulting tornado would kill 23 people).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe trend of [[cord cutting]] has led to concerns that viewers' lessened use of broadcast media in favor of [[over-the-top content|streaming video services]] would inhibit their ability to receive emergency information (notwithstanding [[Wireless Emergency Alerts|availability of alerts on mobile phones]]).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/tech/emergency-alert-netflix-hulu-streaming/index.html|title=Should Netflix and Hulu give you emergency alerts?|last=Wattles|first=Jackie|website=CNN|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/182663/senate-approves-readi-act-to-inform-public-in-emer|title=Senate Approves 'READI' Act To Inform Public In Emergencies|website=All Access|language=en|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref>\n\n==Incidents==\n<!-- Entries in this section MUST be attributed to reliable secondary sources, such as news articles.

Although few studies have investigated the effects of AMPH on gene regulation (Table 1), current data suggest that AMPH acts at multiple levels to alter histone/DNA interaction and to recruit transcription factors which ultimately cause repression of some genes and activation of other genes. Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH. If this proves to be true, the use of specific drugs that inhibit histone acetylation, methylation or DNA methylation might be an important therapeutic alternative to prevent and/or reverse AMPH addiction and mitigate the side effects generate by AMPH when used to treat ADHD. | pmid=27453897 | volume=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid25486626\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker DM, Cates HM, Heller EA, Nestler EJ | title = Regulation of chromatin states by drugs of abuse | journal = Curr.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.}}</ref> Widespread [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone\u2013lysine acetylation]] in cortical [[astrocytes]] appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by ''T. gondii''.<ref name=\"T.

Although few studies have investigated the effects of AMPH on gene regulation (Table 1), current data suggest that AMPH acts at multiple levels to alter histone/DNA interaction and to recruit transcription factors which ultimately cause repression of some genes and activation of other genes. Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH. If this proves to be true, the use of specific drugs that inhibit histone acetylation, methylation or DNA methylation might be an important therapeutic alternative to prevent and/or reverse AMPH addiction and mitigate the side effects generate by AMPH when used to treat ADHD. | pmid=27453897 | volume=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid25486626\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker DM, Cates HM, Heller EA, Nestler EJ | title = Regulation of chromatin states by drugs of abuse | journal = Curr.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.}}</ref> Widespread [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone\u2013lysine acetylation]] in cortical [[astrocytes]] appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by ''T. gondii''.<ref name=\"T.

Loomis, and his wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e McLanahan). He was the brother of [[Stanley Loomis]]. He grew up in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], and attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]. He earned a B.A. from [[Princeton University]] in 1952, and an M.A. from [[Columbia University]] in 1955. He served in the U.S. Army during the [[Korean War]] before returning to teach English and American literature first at the [[University of Vermont]] and then at [[Dartmouth College]], Hanover, where he remained from 1963 to his retirement in 1997. He served as chair of the department from 1977 to 1980. He completed his Ph.D. at Princeton in 1966.<ref>Obituary by Constance Martin in ''Arctic'', vol. 62, no. 3, September 2009, pp. 361-62. [http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic62-3-361.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn 1968, he led an expedition to [[Greenland]], one of five expeditions to the Arctic he made during his lifetime. On this first trip, he received permission to disinter the body of [[Charles Francis Hall]], a Cincinnati journalist who had made two attempts (1860\u201363 and 1864\u201369) to find the grave of [[Sir John Franklin]], and who himself died in the course of an 1871 attempt to reach the North Pole. Rumours had suggested that Hall had not died of natural causes.\n\nLoomis received a Smithsonian grant to go to Greenland, dig up Hall\u2019s body, take samples of the hair and fingernails, and send them for forensic analysis. Although he succeeded in doing so, the results of the analysis were not conclusive: the remains contained traces of arsenic, which could indicate poisoning, but since arsenic was a component of many medicines, it is possible that Hall had inadvertently overdosed himself.\n\nThis research expedition inspired Loomis\u2019s well-known book, ''Weird and Tragic Shores: The Story of Charles Francis Hall, Explorer'', published by Knopf in 1971. A 2001 article by Sara Wheeler in the ''New York Times''<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/25/reviews/010225.25wheelet.html Sara Wheeler, \"In Cold Blood?\" ''New York Times'', February 25, 2001]</ref> notes:\n\n{{quote|Chauncey Loomis [is an] accomplished writer&nbsp;... and his \u201cWeird and Tragic Shores,\u201d recently reissued&nbsp;... in the Modern Library\u2019s Exploration Series, unravels the expedition brilliantly and also offers a concise and intelligent introduction to the history of Arctic exploration&nbsp;... Loomis conjures flesh and blood from the flimsy old journals and lifts the story from the pincers of the pack ice into the warm, fathomless and infinitely more thrilling realm of the human spirit.}}\n\nThe book has been maintained in print by the Modern Library and was the subject of a CBC television documentary in the early 1970s. In 1981, the National Geographic Society cited the book in its ''Atlas of the World'' by marking the location of Hall's grave on its map of Greenland and noting:\n\n{{quote|A dissension-plagued U.S. expedition to the North Pole was disrupted when leader Charles Francis Hall died here in 1871.

Loomis wrote many essays about the Arctic, most notably \u201cThe Arctic Sublime,\u201d which appeared in ''Nature and the Victorian Imagination'', edited by U.C. Knoepflmacher and G.B. Tennyson (University of California Press, 1977). This article focuses on the watercolours and drawings of early Arctic explorers and their relationship to their journals and narratives.

Loomis, and his wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e McLanahan). He was the brother of [[Stanley Loomis]]. He grew up in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], and attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]. He earned a B.A. from [[Princeton University]] in 1952, and an M.A. from [[Columbia University]] in 1955. He served in the U.S. Army during the [[Korean War]] before returning to teach English and American literature first at the [[University of Vermont]] and then at [[Dartmouth College]], Hanover, where he remained from 1963 to his retirement in 1997. He served as chair of the department from 1977 to 1980. He completed his Ph.D. at Princeton in 1966.<ref>Obituary by Constance Martin in ''Arctic'', vol. 62, no. 3, September 2009, pp. 361-62. [http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic62-3-361.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn 1968, he led an expedition to [[Greenland]], one of five expeditions to the Arctic he made during his lifetime. On this first trip, he received permission to disinter the body of [[Charles Francis Hall]], a Cincinnati journalist who had made two attempts (1860\u201363 and 1864\u201369) to find the grave of [[Sir John Franklin]], and who himself died in the course of an 1871 attempt to reach the North Pole. Rumours had suggested that Hall had not died of natural causes.\n\nLoomis received a Smithsonian grant to go to Greenland, dig up Hall\u2019s body, take samples of the hair and fingernails, and send them for forensic analysis. Although he succeeded in doing so, the results of the analysis were not conclusive: the remains contained traces of arsenic, which could indicate poisoning, but since arsenic was a component of many medicines, it is possible that Hall had inadvertently overdosed himself.\n\nThis research expedition inspired Loomis\u2019s well-known book, ''Weird and Tragic Shores: The Story of Charles Francis Hall, Explorer'', published by Knopf in 1971. A 2001 article by Sara Wheeler in the ''New York Times''<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/25/reviews/010225.25wheelet.html Sara Wheeler, \"In Cold Blood?\" ''New York Times'', February 25, 2001]</ref> notes:\n\n{{quote|Chauncey Loomis [is an] accomplished writer&nbsp;... and his \u201cWeird and Tragic Shores,\u201d recently reissued&nbsp;... in the Modern Library\u2019s Exploration Series, unravels the expedition brilliantly and also offers a concise and intelligent introduction to the history of Arctic exploration&nbsp;... Loomis conjures flesh and blood from the flimsy old journals and lifts the story from the pincers of the pack ice into the warm, fathomless and infinitely more thrilling realm of the human spirit.}}\n\nThe book has been maintained in print by the Modern Library and was the subject of a CBC television documentary in the early 1970s. In 1981, the National Geographic Society cited the book in its ''Atlas of the World'' by marking the location of Hall's grave on its map of Greenland and noting:\n\n{{quote|A dissension-plagued U.S. expedition to the North Pole was disrupted when leader Charles Francis Hall died here in 1871. Permafrost preserved his body, which was exhumed in 1968 by Chauncey Loomis, who found that Hall had been poisoned with arsenic.<ref>National Geographic Society, Atlas of the World, 1981, p. 225</ref>}}\n\nChauncey C. Loomis wrote many essays about the Arctic, most notably \u201cThe Arctic Sublime,\u201d which appeared in ''Nature and the Victorian Imagination'', edited by U.C. Knoepflmacher and G.B. Tennyson (University of California Press, 1977). This article focuses on the watercolours and drawings of early Arctic explorers and their relationship to their journals and narratives. He also wrote many [http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/chauncey-loomis%20reviews reviews of books]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} about the North for the [[London Review of Books]] as well as articles about Thackeray, Joyce, Twain, and Stephen Crane for scholarly journals.\n\nIn 1996, Loomis, with art historian Constance Martin, annotated and wrote the introduction for an illustrated edition of ''Arctic Explorations: The Second Grinnell Expedition in Search of Sir John Franklin, 1853 by Elisha Kent Kane'' (R.R. Donnelley & Sons, 1996). He was a lifelong member of the [http://www.arctic.ucalgary.ca/ Arctic Institute of North America].\n\nLoomis was an avid fly fisherman and a keen photographer, and travelled to Peru, Kenya, and Sikkim, to photograph archeological sites, people, and wildlife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E3D6133AF932A05750C0A96F9C8B63|title=Paid Notice: Deaths LOOMIS, CHAUNCEY CHESTER JR|date=31 March 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> In 1964, he made a CBS documentary about muskoxen in Alaska, titled ''Wild River, Wild Beasts''.\n\nIn retirement, he served on many boards and through the Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation established a fund to help students from Berkshire County High School attend college.
