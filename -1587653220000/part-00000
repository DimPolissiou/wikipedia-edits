shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is [[StatCounter]]<ref>https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201508-201508-bar StatCounter</ref> basing its estimate on web use (although this may not be [[Usage share of web browsers#Accuracy|very accurate]]). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a [[Pre-installed software|pre-installed operating system]], with some users replacing that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or installing another OS alongside it and using both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China consisted of illegitimate copies.<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/business/global/19iht-windows.html|title= Software Pirates in China Beat Microsoft to the Punch | work= The New York Times | date=19 October 2009}}</ref> In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25\u201335% of all Windows&nbsp;XP installations were unlicensed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|title=Around 25\u201335% of Windows XP systems are pirated (calculations included)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063513/http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe usage share of Microsoft's latest client operating system{{snd}} [[Windows&nbsp;10]]{{snd}} has been slowly increasing since July/August 2016 (while [[Windows&nbsp;7]] has had a slight decrease at the same time), reaching around 27.15% in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-weekly-201406-201641|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201511-201610|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWeb analysis shows significant variation in different parts of the world.

shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is [[StatCounter]]<ref>https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201508-201508-bar StatCounter</ref> basing its estimate on web use (although this may not be [[Usage share of web browsers#Accuracy|very accurate]]). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a [[Pre-installed software|pre-installed operating system]], with some users replacing that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or installing another OS alongside it and using both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China consisted of illegitimate copies.<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/business/global/19iht-windows.html|title= Software Pirates in China Beat Microsoft to the Punch | work= The New York Times | date=19 October 2009}}</ref> In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25\u201335% of all Windows&nbsp;XP installations were unlicensed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|title=Around 25\u201335% of Windows XP systems are pirated (calculations included)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063513/http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe usage share of Microsoft's latest client operating system{{snd}} [[Windows&nbsp;10]]{{snd}} has been slowly increasing since July/August 2016 (while [[Windows&nbsp;7]] has had a slight decrease at the same time), reaching around 27.15% in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-weekly-201406-201641|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201511-201610|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWeb analysis shows significant variation in different parts of the world.

By far the most significant (and at the same time the most well preserved one) is the Seat Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei}}) or Suceava Citadel, a medieval castle situated on the eastern edge of the contemporary city.\n\nThe fortress was built during the reign of [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] (1375\u20131391), also known as Petru Mu\u0219at. It was further expanded and strengthened during the reigns of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] (1400\u20131432) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504). The medieval castle was part of the fortification system built in [[Moldavia]] in the late 14th century, because of the emergence of the Ottoman danger. It became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (the conqueror of [[Constantinople]]), in 1476.\n\nSuceava was the capital city of the former Principality of Moldavia between 1388 and 1565. During this period, the castle served as princely residence. [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] had subsequently moved the Moldavian capital to [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1565, so the castle lost its status. Afterwards, the citadel entered a period of steep decline. In 1675, during the reign of voivode Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino, the fortress was destroyed. Then, for over two centuries, the castle was completely deserted.\n\n[[File:Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei la ceas de seara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The late 14th century Moldavian seat fortress as seen during nighttime in May, 2015.]]\n\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century, under the patronage of Austrian architect [[:ro:Karl Romstorfer|Karl Adolf Romstorfer]], a series of rehabilitation works and archaeological research were conducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dragusanul.ro/romstorfer-vienezul-care-a-indatorat-bucovina/|author=Dragu\u0219anul.ro|work=Dr\u0103gu\u0219anul|title=Romstorfer, vienezul care a \u00eendatorat Bucovina (in Romanian)|accessdate= 8 March 2020}}</ref> Between 1961 and 1970 other restoration and consolidation works were carried out. In 2013, a major reconstruction program was launched, to return the castle to its original architecture and shape.\n\nThe Seat Fortress of Suceava consists of two concentric citadels. The inner citadel, known as ''fortul mu\u0219atin'', has a rectangular shape and a patio. It was built by Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century. In the second half of the 15th century, Stephen the Great expanded the structure, by adding another citadel that has a circular shape which surrounds the old one.\n\nAfter 1476, new fortifications were added to the outer citadel. Furthermore, the whole castle is encircled by a large defensive ditch. Today, the fortress is a landmark of Suceava and a noteworthy touristic attraction. Since 2011, it has also been used for hosting cultural events such as the [[rock music]] festival Bucovina Rock Castle. The festival had attracted a series of noteworthy national and international musical acts (e.g. guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]], formerly of Dutch [[progressive rock]] band [[Focus (band)|Focus]]).<ref>[http://www.bucovinarockcastle.ro Bucovina Rock Castle official website (in Romanian)]</ref>\n\n===The Princely Court of Suceava===\n\n[[File:Curtea domneasca din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|left|Present-day ruins of the local Princely Court.]]\n\nThe Princely Court of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din Suceava}}) was built and developed related with the Seat Fortress. In late 14th century, voivode Petru Mu\u0219at built the Princely House, a structure made in wood, which included a cellar. After 1400, Alexander I of Moldavia rebuilt the wooden house and added a surrounding wall made of stone and a complex of buildings, also made of stone. In the second half of the 15th century, the Princely Court was severely affected by fire, the wooden house being completely burned out.\n\nDuring his reign, Stephen the Great (1457\u20131504) restored the whole complex. A new Princely House was built, this time made of stone, and the other buildings were extended. [[Vasile Lupu]] (1634\u20131653) was the last ruler of Moldavia who took care of the Princely Court. During his time, the cellars were rehabilitated. The complex was abandoned in late 17th century, the buildings and the walls being gradually dismantled. Currently, on the site of the Princely Court there are only ruins and leftovers of the former buildings.\n\nThe ruins of the former medieval court are located in the city center of Suceava. In the 14th\u201317th centuries, in the proximity of the Princely Court there were built several churches that still exist today and attract tourists.\n\n[[File:Cetatea \u015echeia10.jpg|thumb|right|The ruined walls of the \u0218cheia Fortress on \u0218eptilici Hill.]]\n\n===\u0218cheia Fortress===\n\nOn the north-western edge of the contemporary city, on a hilltop, there is another medieval citadel known as ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress ({{lang-ro|Cetatea \u0218cheia}}) or the Western Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Apus a Sucevei}}). Unlike the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress has left nothing but some ruined walls. The citadel proper was built during the reign of Petru Mu\u0219at during the late 14th century, but was short-lived, given that it was dismantled during the early 15th century, in the time of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]]. ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress, just like the main Seat Fortress, was part of the fortification system built in medieval Principality of Moldavia during the late 14th century.\n\n===Museums===\n\n[[File:Muzeul Judetean din Suceava7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Bukovina History Museum. During the [[interwar period]], the building served as Suceava County prefecture.]]\n\nThe first museum in Suceava was opened in 1900, by the initiative of some local intellectuals. In the beginning, the museum included only a few collections that were obtained as a result of the researches and excavation works at the Seat Fortress of Suceava. The museum was expanded and developed over time and became an important cultural institution, currently named [[Bukovina Museum]] ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Bucovinei}}). It has several departments and administers the medieval sites of the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress and the Princely Court, local museums (Bukovina Village Museum, the history, ethnographic, and natural sciences museums), the memorial houses of [[Simion Florea Marian]] in Suceava, [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] in [[M\u0103lini]], [[:ro:Eusebiu Camilar|Eusebiu Camilar]] in [[Ude\u0219ti]], [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] in [[Ciprian Porumbescu, Suceava|Stupca]], and two traditional houses located in [[Solca]] and [[Bilca]].\n\nThe oldest department of Bukovina Museum is the history museum, which was the backbone for creating a county museum at Suceava. This museum presents the local history of Suceava and Moldavia in the context of Romanian national history. The exhibits of the history museum and the offices of Bukovina Museum are located in a historic building, in the city center. The building, which hosted the prefecture of Suceava County during the interwar period, was built between 1902\u20131903. Since 1968, it houses the history museum. In 2014, the building and the museum entered an extensive program of modernization, rehabilitation, and expansion.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|align=left\n|image1 = Cr\u00e2\u0219ma din \u0218aru Dornei - panoramio.jpg|caption1=Inn from [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]] ({{lang-de|Dorna Watra}}) ethnographic area, exhibited at Bukovina Village Museum\n|image2 = Casa Vicovu de Jos1.jpg|caption2=Traditional household from [[Vicovu de Jos]] ({{lang-de|Unter Wikow}})\n|image3 = Gospod\u0103ria Straja6.jpg|caption3=Traditional household from [[Straja, Suceava|Straja]] ({{lang-de|Strasza}})\n|image4 = Moara din M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului.jpg|caption4=Windmill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]] ({{lang-de|Humora Kloster}})\n}}\n\nAt the history museum there is a reconstitution of a scene from the former throne hall located in the Seat Fortress.

It was opened in 1968 and includes old collections and exhibits that are housed in a medieval inn located in the center of Suceava, known as the Princely Inn of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Hanul Domnesc din Suceava}}). This landmark dates from the late 16th and early 17th century. It was built of stone and has two floors and a cellar. During the Austrian rule (1775\u20131918), the inn operated as a hunting lodge for the imperial family. Since 1968, it hosts the ethnographic museum.

It highlights the flora and fauna of the surrounding area. The museum's rare exhibits and collections are housed in an old building, located in the central park of the city and built between 1811\u20131814. In the past, before being an attraction for visitors, the building operated as a school for boys.\n\nAlong with all these museums, Bukovina Museum includes memorial houses of some writers and artists born in this area of the country. The memorial house of Simion Florea Marian ({{lang-ro|Casa memorial\u0103 Simion Florea Marian}}) is the only one located in Suceava, the other ones being in the surrounding area. The memorial house operates as a museum. It was opened in 1974 in the home where Romanian priest and writer Simion Florea Marian lived, from 1884 until 1907, when he died. The museum hosts a collection that contains over 10,000 volumes, over 450 collections of magazines and newspapers, of which 150 are from [[Bukovina]], manuscripts, letters, cultural and historical documents, old photos. In front of the memorial house it was opened a small park with a statue dedicated to Simion Florea Marian.\n\n===Historical buildings===\n\n[[File:Casa Aleea Trandafirilor nr. 4 din Suceava1.jpg|thumb|left|Austrian-style house situated in the old city centre.]]\n\n''Colegiul de Art\u0103 Ciprian Porumbescu'' ({{lang-ro|Ciprian Porumbescu Art College}}) is a high school which is hosted in a historic building, built in 1859, in the city center of Suceava.

The construction began during the reign of voivode [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] of Moldavia, after the nearby Mir\u0103u\u021bi Church (the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia at that moment) was devastated in 1513. The construction was completed by [[Stephen IV of Moldavia]] (also known as \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103). The monastery church served as metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia until 1677. It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of eight buildings that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/598 Churches of Moldavia] at the UNESCO site</ref> Since 1991 Saint John the New Monastery serves as the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Suceava and R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]].

[[Alexander I of Moldavia]] brought his relics to Suceava in 1402.\n\nMir\u0103u\u021bi Church, dedicated to Saint George, is the oldest religious building in Suceava, founded by [[Petru II of Moldavia]] in late 14th century, in the same period with the Seat Fortress, when he moved the capital from [[Siret]] to Suceava. The church established the city as a see of it. Mir\u0103u\u021bi was the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia between 1402 and 1522, when the church of Saint John the New Monastery was completed. In 1402, the relics of Saint John the New were transferred to this church from [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]], and then, in 1589 transferred again to the nearby monastery church by voivode [[Peter the Lame]]. The name ''Mir\u0103u\u021bi'' derives from the fact that it was the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. [[Stephen the Great]] was crowned in here in 1457. After the church was devastated, it was rebuilt in early 17th century, and then, in the 18th century, abandoned.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]] was founded by [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], ruler of Moldavia (1527\u20131538, 1541\u20131546), and the son of Stephan the Great. The church was built in 1534\u20131535, with a bell tower added in 1560\u20131561 by Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. The bell tower is 40 meters high, being the tallest bell tower in Suceava and a landmark of the city. The church had frescoes painted on the outside, that are still visible on one side wall. The frescoes inside were restored recently. Church of Saint Demetrius is located near the ruins of the former Princely Court of Suceava.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = M\u0103n\u0103stirea Sf\u00e2ntul Ioan cel Nou35.jpg\n| image2 = Biserica Sf.

Church of [[Saint John the Baptist]], also known as Coconilor Church or Domni\u021belor Church, was founded in 1643 by [[Vasile Lupu]], voivode of Moldavia between 1632 and 1653. It has no exterior frescoes and a short bell tower that has its roof linked with the roof above the church. In its early days, the church functioned as a chapel for the Princely Court.\n\nChurch of the Resurrection (located in the proximity of Saint John the New Monastery) dates from 1551, and was founded by Elena Rare\u0219, the wife of voivode Peter IV Rare\u0219. The church has no tower above the [[cella|naos]], its architecture reflecting the urban style of the medieval period. Instead of the bell tower, the church has a [[zvonnitsa]], an architectural form especially used in the [[Russian architecture]] of the 14th\u201317th centuries. Church of the Resurrection was used by the local Roman Catholic community during the Habsburg occupation, and then by the Ruthenian Greek Catholic community, until 1936. It is also known as ''V\u0103scresenia Church'' or ''Elena Doamna'' Church.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Nicholas]] (Pr\u0103jescu) is another religious building in Suceava that features the medieval Moldavian architectural style. The present church was rebuilt by treasurer Nicoar\u0103 Pr\u0103jescu in 1611, during the reign of Constantin Movil\u0103 (1607\u20131611). Throughout its history, the church functioned as a necropolis for the local [[boyar]]s.\n\nBetween the city center and I\u021bcani neighborhood, on the slopes that descend to the [[Suceava (river)|Suceava river valley]], there is Church of the Assumption, another old Romanian Orthodox church, founded in the first half of the 17th century (1639). The church was built on the place where I\u021bcani Monastery existed before. It functioned as a nunnery until late 18th century. Today it is parish church, and has a zvonnitsa similar to that of Church of the Resurrection, located downtown.\n\nIn Burdujeni neighborhood, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, there is Teodoreni Monastery, founded in 1597 by local boyar Teodor Movil\u0103, the elder brother of [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]], ruler of Moldavia (1595\u20131600, 1600\u20131606). Burdujeni village (now a district of Suceava) was established and developed around this monastery. The set of buildings includes Church of Ascension, the bell tower, living quarters for nuns and a surrounding wall. Just {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of Teodoreni Monastery, in the old district of Burdujeni, there is Church of the Holy Trinity, founded by archimandrite Filaret Scriban in 1851.\n\nI\u021bcani neighborhood has two Romanian Orthodox churches founded in the first half of the 20th century: Church of the Holy Archangels (built near [[Suceava North railway station]], in 1933\u20131938) and Church of the Holy Apostles (located on [[European route E85]] and built in 1905\u20131908 by the German community of I\u021bcani, initially as a Lutheran church).\n\n[[Church of the Holy Cross, P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi|Church of the Holy Cross]], located in [[P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi]] village (a few miles north-west of I\u021bcani), was founded in 1487 by Stephen the Great, and is one of the monuments that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Also not far away from I\u021bcani, there is [[Dragomirna Monastery]], established by clergyman [[Anastasie Crimca]] in 1609.

Their cultural and historical legacy is highlighted by a series of well preserved religious buildings that still exist to this today.\n\nThe most representative ecclesiastical landmark established by the local Armenian population is Zamca Monastery (the term Zamca can actually trace its linguistic origin to [[Polish language|Polish]], denoting as such a 'fortified place' and being named this way by [[List of Polish monarchs|King]] [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] in 1691), a fortified complex of buildings located on a plateau at the western point of the contemporary city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calatoresc.ro/descopera-orasul-suceava/|author=Isabela|work=c\u0103l\u0103toresc.ro|title=Descoper\u0103 ora\u0219ul Suceava (in Romanian)|date=2 October 2013|accessdate= 28 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nZamca Monastery was constructed between 1551 and 1606 and its church is dedicated to Saint Auxentius. Along with the church, the monastery includes several buildings made of stone and a defensive wall that surrounds the whole medieval complex.\n\nBetween Zamca Monastery and the city center there are two more Armenian Orthodox churches. Church of Saint Simon (also known as The Red Tower Church because of its bell tower) was founded in 1513. The bell tower was constructed in 1551.\n\nThe church has an old Armenian cemetery in the proximity and a chapel that was built in 1902 (Pruncul Chapel). Church of the Holy Cross was established in 1521 and was renovated several times in its history. The Armenian parsonage is located near the church, along with several old tomb stones.\n\nHagigadar Monastery is another medieval complex built by the local Armenians. It was founded in 1512\u20131513, and is located on the south-western proximity of the city, on a valley near [[European route E85]].\n\n==Tourism==\n\nIn the past few years Suceava started to evolve more rapidly. The most important sights in the town date from its time as a princely capital (i.e. the Middle Ages). There are numerous museums in the city proper including, most notably, the Bucovina History Museum, the Bucovina Village Museum,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muzeulbucovinei.ro/muzeul-satului-bucovinean/|author=www.monitorulsv.ro|work=Muzeul Bucovinei|title=Muzeul Satului Bucovinean|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref> Bucovina Ethnographic Museum (housed in an inn dating back to the 17th century),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orasulsuceava.ro/unde-iesim/obiective-turistice/muzee/muzeul-etnografic-hanul-domnesc/|work=Ora\u0219ul Suceava|title=Muzeul Etnografic Hanul Domnesc (in Romanian)|accessdate= 28 September 2018}}</ref> or the Natural History Museum.\n\n== Sports ==\n\n=== Football ===\n\n[[File:Stadionul Areni7.jpg|thumb|right|Areni Stadium stand]]\n\n[[ACS Foresta Suceava]] ({{lang-ro|Asocia\u021bia Club Sportiv Foresta Suceava}}), formerly known as Rapid CFR Suceava, is the football team that currently represents the city of Suceava in the third tier of the Romanian football system, more specifically in [[Liga III]].\n\nIn the past, the city has also had other significant football clubs competing in either [[Liga I]] or Liga II (depending on their level of performance) such as [[CSM Suceava]], [[FC Cetatea Suceava]], or [[Foresta F\u0103lticeni|Foresta Suceava]] (the latter one being initially based in the city of [[F\u0103lticeni]] from the same county).

By far the most significant (and at the same time the most well preserved one) is the Seat Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei}}) or Suceava Citadel, a medieval castle situated on the eastern edge of the contemporary city.\n\nThe fortress was built during the reign of [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] (1375\u20131391), also known as Petru Mu\u0219at. It was further expanded and strengthened during the reigns of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] (1400\u20131432) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504). The medieval castle was part of the fortification system built in [[Moldavia]] in the late 14th century, because of the emergence of the Ottoman danger. It became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (the conqueror of [[Constantinople]]), in 1476.\n\nSuceava was the capital city of the former Principality of Moldavia between 1388 and 1565. During this period, the castle served as princely residence. [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] had subsequently moved the Moldavian capital to [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1565, so the castle lost its status. Afterwards, the citadel entered a period of steep decline. In 1675, during the reign of voivode Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino, the fortress was destroyed. Then, for over two centuries, the castle was completely deserted.\n\n[[File:Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei la ceas de seara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The late 14th century Moldavian seat fortress as seen during nighttime in May, 2015.]]\n\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century, under the patronage of Austrian architect [[:ro:Karl Romstorfer|Karl Adolf Romstorfer]], a series of rehabilitation works and archaeological research were conducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dragusanul.ro/romstorfer-vienezul-care-a-indatorat-bucovina/|author=Dragu\u0219anul.ro|work=Dr\u0103gu\u0219anul|title=Romstorfer, vienezul care a \u00eendatorat Bucovina (in Romanian)|accessdate= 8 March 2020}}</ref> Between 1961 and 1970 other restoration and consolidation works were carried out. In 2013, a major reconstruction program was launched, to return the castle to its original architecture and shape.\n\nThe Seat Fortress of Suceava consists of two concentric citadels. The inner citadel, known as ''fortul mu\u0219atin'', has a rectangular shape and a patio. It was built by Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century. In the second half of the 15th century, Stephen the Great expanded the structure, by adding another citadel that has a circular shape which surrounds the old one.\n\nAfter 1476, new fortifications were added to the outer citadel. Furthermore, the whole castle is encircled by a large defensive ditch. Today, the fortress is a landmark of Suceava and a noteworthy touristic attraction. Since 2011, it has also been used for hosting cultural events such as the [[rock music]] festival Bucovina Rock Castle. The festival had attracted a series of noteworthy national and international musical acts (e.g. guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]], formerly of Dutch [[progressive rock]] band [[Focus (band)|Focus]]).<ref>[http://www.bucovinarockcastle.ro Bucovina Rock Castle official website (in Romanian)]</ref>\n\n===The Princely Court of Suceava===\n\n[[File:Curtea domneasca din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|left|Present-day ruins of the local Princely Court.]]\n\nThe Princely Court of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din Suceava}}) was built and developed related with the Seat Fortress. In late 14th century, voivode Petru Mu\u0219at built the Princely House, a structure made in wood, which included a cellar. After 1400, Alexander I of Moldavia rebuilt the wooden house and added a surrounding wall made of stone and a complex of buildings, also made of stone. In the second half of the 15th century, the Princely Court was severely affected by fire, the wooden house being completely burned out.\n\nDuring his reign, Stephen the Great (1457\u20131504) restored the whole complex. A new Princely House was built, this time made of stone, and the other buildings were extended. [[Vasile Lupu]] (1634\u20131653) was the last ruler of Moldavia who took care of the Princely Court. During his time, the cellars were rehabilitated. The complex was abandoned in late 17th century, the buildings and the walls being gradually dismantled. Currently, on the site of the Princely Court there are only ruins and leftovers of the former buildings.\n\nThe ruins of the former medieval court are located in the city center of Suceava. In the 14th\u201317th centuries, in the proximity of the Princely Court there were built several churches that still exist today and attract tourists.\n\n[[File:Cetatea \u015echeia10.jpg|thumb|right|The ruined walls of the \u0218cheia Fortress on \u0218eptilici Hill.]]\n\n===\u0218cheia Fortress===\n\nOn the north-western edge of the contemporary city, on a hilltop, there is another medieval citadel known as ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress ({{lang-ro|Cetatea \u0218cheia}}) or the Western Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Apus a Sucevei}}). Unlike the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress has left nothing but some ruined walls. The citadel proper was built during the reign of Petru Mu\u0219at during the late 14th century, but was short-lived, given that it was dismantled during the early 15th century, in the time of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]]. ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress, just like the main Seat Fortress, was part of the fortification system built in medieval Principality of Moldavia during the late 14th century.\n\n===Museums===\n\n[[File:Muzeul Judetean din Suceava7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Bukovina History Museum. During the [[interwar period]], the building served as Suceava County prefecture.]]\n\nThe first museum in Suceava was opened in 1900, by the initiative of some local intellectuals. In the beginning, the museum included only a few collections that were obtained as a result of the researches and excavation works at the Seat Fortress of Suceava. The museum was expanded and developed over time and became an important cultural institution, currently named [[Bukovina Museum]] ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Bucovinei}}). It has several departments and administers the medieval sites of the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress and the Princely Court, local museums (Bukovina Village Museum, the history, ethnographic, and natural sciences museums), the memorial houses of [[Simion Florea Marian]] in Suceava, [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] in [[M\u0103lini]], [[:ro:Eusebiu Camilar|Eusebiu Camilar]] in [[Ude\u0219ti]], [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] in [[Ciprian Porumbescu, Suceava|Stupca]], and two traditional houses located in [[Solca]] and [[Bilca]].\n\nThe oldest department of Bukovina Museum is the history museum, which was the backbone for creating a county museum at Suceava. This museum presents the local history of Suceava and Moldavia in the context of Romanian national history. The exhibits of the history museum and the offices of Bukovina Museum are located in a historic building, in the city center. The building, which hosted the prefecture of Suceava County during the interwar period, was built between 1902\u20131903. Since 1968, it houses the history museum. In 2014, the building and the museum entered an extensive program of modernization, rehabilitation, and expansion.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|align=left\n|image1 = Cr\u00e2\u0219ma din \u0218aru Dornei - panoramio.jpg|caption1=Inn from [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]] ({{lang-de|Dorna Watra}}) ethnographic area, exhibited at Bukovina Village Museum\n|image2 = Casa Vicovu de Jos1.jpg|caption2=Traditional household from [[Vicovu de Jos]] ({{lang-de|Unter Wikow}})\n|image3 = Gospod\u0103ria Straja6.jpg|caption3=Traditional household from [[Straja, Suceava|Straja]] ({{lang-de|Strasza}})\n|image4 = Moara din M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului.jpg|caption4=Windmill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]] ({{lang-de|Humora Kloster}})\n}}\n\nAt the history museum there is a reconstitution of a scene from the former throne hall located in the Seat Fortress. The scene presents some notable people from the history of Moldavia, made in glass fiber: [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (ruler of Moldavia), Maria Voichi\u021ba (his third wife), [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] (his son and successor to the throne), officials of that time. The scene chosen to be reconstructed is an allotment of land for peasants. The reconstitution is based on medieval documents, frescoes and archaeological researches. Furthermore, the history museum periodically organizes a wide range of cultural events, several of which also involve the local branch of the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.istorielocala.ro/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=878:forumul-democrat-al-germanilor-din-bucovina&Itemid=204|author=www.istorielocala.ro|work=Istoria Local\u0103 @ biblioteca ta public\u0103|title=Forumul Democrat al Germanilor din Bucovina (in Romanian)|date= 14 October 2013| accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adz.ro/artikel/artikel/die-geschichte-der-deutschen-in-rumaenien-wurde-noch-nicht-zu-ende-geschrieben/|author=www.adz.ro|work=Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung f\u00fcr Rum\u00e4nien|title=Die Geschichte der Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien wurde noch nicht zu Ende geschrieben (in German)|date= 8 January 2014| accessdate= 1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBukovina Village Museum ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Satului Bucovinean}}) is an open-air museum that highlights the traditional cultural and architectural heritage of [[Bukovina]] region. It is located in the eastern part of Suceava, near the Seat Fortress. It was founded in the 1970s, but its major expansion and development took place after 1990. The museum is designed as a traditional village in Bukovina, containing houses and various objectives from the ethnographic areas of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Gura Humorului|Humor]], [[C\u00e2mpulung Moldovenesc]], [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]], and [[F\u0103lticeni]].\n\nThe museum includes among others a water mill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]], a traditional blacksmith workshop, a pottery workshop from [[Marginea]] and one of the many old wooden churches in northern Moldavia: Church of the Ascension, a Romanian Orthodox wooden church built in 1783 in [[Vama, Suceava|Vama]], a village in [[Suceava County]]. The bell tower is also made in wood, and dates from 1787. The church and the bell tower were both relocated in 2001, and currently are part of the museum.\n\n[[File:Hanul Domnesc din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Princely Inn (now Ethnographic Museum)]]\n\nBesides Bukovina Village Museum, another museum that reflects the traditional life in this part of Romania is the ethnographic museum. It was opened in 1968 and includes old collections and exhibits that are housed in a medieval inn located in the center of Suceava, known as the Princely Inn of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Hanul Domnesc din Suceava}}). This landmark dates from the late 16th and early 17th century. It was built of stone and has two floors and a cellar. During the Austrian rule (1775\u20131918), the inn operated as a hunting lodge for the imperial family. Since 1968, it hosts the ethnographic museum. The Princely Inn is the oldest civic building in Suceava which had not been seriously affected by time and maintained its original architecture.\n\n[[File:Muzeul de Stiintele Naturii din Suceava4.jpg|thumb|right|Natural Sciences Museum]]\n\nThe natural sciences museum was founded in 1976\u20131977, being the newest museum in Suceava. It highlights the flora and fauna of the surrounding area. The museum's rare exhibits and collections are housed in an old building, located in the central park of the city and built between 1811\u20131814. In the past, before being an attraction for visitors, the building operated as a school for boys.\n\nAlong with all these museums, Bukovina Museum includes memorial houses of some writers and artists born in this area of the country. The memorial house of Simion Florea Marian ({{lang-ro|Casa memorial\u0103 Simion Florea Marian}}) is the only one located in Suceava, the other ones being in the surrounding area. The memorial house operates as a museum. It was opened in 1974 in the home where Romanian priest and writer Simion Florea Marian lived, from 1884 until 1907, when he died. The museum hosts a collection that contains over 10,000 volumes, over 450 collections of magazines and newspapers, of which 150 are from [[Bukovina]], manuscripts, letters, cultural and historical documents, old photos. In front of the memorial house it was opened a small park with a statue dedicated to Simion Florea Marian.\n\n===Historical buildings===\n\n[[File:Casa Aleea Trandafirilor nr. 4 din Suceava1.jpg|thumb|left|Austrian-style house situated in the old city centre.]]\n\n''Colegiul de Art\u0103 Ciprian Porumbescu'' ({{lang-ro|Ciprian Porumbescu Art College}}) is a high school which is hosted in a historic building, built in 1859, in the city center of Suceava. The building had several destinations in the past: Suceava Town Hall (until 1904) and ''\u0218coala primar\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103 de fete'' (Primary Romanian school for girls).

Initially established as a small village in the 15th century under the rulership of [[Alex\u0103ndrel of Moldavia]], it subsequently expanded as a German-speaking colony much later, specifically starting in the late 19th century, seeing an influx of German settlers during the [[Josephine colonization]] ({{lang-de|Josephinische Kolonisation}}) which took place in the time of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Talsky-Josef-Heimat-von-gestern-Regional-distribution-of-Germans-in-Bukovina.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The Regional Distribution of the Germans in Bukovina|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Stephani-Claus-1978-Settlement-of-German-Population-Groups-in-Bukovina-E.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The Golden Bistritz - The Settlement of German Population Groups in Bukovina|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref> [[Suceava North railway station|The north railway station]] (which depicts architectural elements of both [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] and [[Neo-romanticism|Neo-romanticist]] styles, also the oldest in the city) is situated in this neighbourhood as well.\n\n=== Monuments ===\n\nNear the fortress, in \u0218ipote-Cetate Park, there is an [[equestrian statue]] of Stephen the Great, designed and made by the local sculptor Iftimie B\u00e2rleanu in 1977. The monument has 23 meters in height, being the tallest equestrian statue in Romania. In the city centre there's also a statue dedicated to [[Petru Mu\u0219at]], Prince of Moldavia between 1375\u20131391.\n\n===Religious buildings===\n\n====Romanian Orthodox churches====\n\nOne of the most important cultural sites in Suceava is [[Saint John the New Monastery]] which includes the monumental Church of [[Saint George]], built between 1514 and 1522. The construction began during the reign of voivode [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] of Moldavia, after the nearby Mir\u0103u\u021bi Church (the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia at that moment) was devastated in 1513. The construction was completed by [[Stephen IV of Moldavia]] (also known as \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103). The monastery church served as metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia until 1677. It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of eight buildings that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/598 Churches of Moldavia] at the UNESCO site</ref> Since 1991 Saint John the New Monastery serves as the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Suceava and R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]].

[[Alexander I of Moldavia]] brought his relics to Suceava in 1402.\n\nMir\u0103u\u021bi Church, dedicated to Saint George, is the oldest religious building in Suceava, founded by [[Petru II of Moldavia]] in late 14th century, in the same period with the Seat Fortress, when he moved the capital from [[Siret]] to Suceava. The church established the city as a see of it. Mir\u0103u\u021bi was the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia between 1402 and 1522, when the church of Saint John the New Monastery was completed. In 1402, the relics of Saint John the New were transferred to this church from [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]], and then, in 1589 transferred again to the nearby monastery church by voivode [[Peter the Lame]]. The name ''Mir\u0103u\u021bi'' derives from the fact that it was the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. [[Stephen the Great]] was crowned in here in 1457. After the church was devastated, it was rebuilt in early 17th century, and then, in the 18th century, abandoned.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]] was founded by [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], ruler of Moldavia (1527\u20131538, 1541\u20131546), and the son of Stephan the Great. The church was built in 1534\u20131535, with a bell tower added in 1560\u20131561 by Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. The bell tower is 40 meters high, being the tallest bell tower in Suceava and a landmark of the city. The church had frescoes painted on the outside, that are still visible on one side wall. The frescoes inside were restored recently. Church of Saint Demetrius is located near the ruins of the former Princely Court of Suceava.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = M\u0103n\u0103stirea Sf\u00e2ntul Ioan cel Nou35.jpg\n| image2 = Biserica Sf.

Church of [[Saint John the Baptist]], also known as Coconilor Church or Domni\u021belor Church, was founded in 1643 by [[Vasile Lupu]], voivode of Moldavia between 1632 and 1653. It has no exterior frescoes and a short bell tower that has its roof linked with the roof above the church. In its early days, the church functioned as a chapel for the Princely Court.\n\nChurch of the Resurrection (located in the proximity of Saint John the New Monastery) dates from 1551, and was founded by Elena Rare\u0219, the wife of voivode Peter IV Rare\u0219. The church has no tower above the [[cella|naos]], its architecture reflecting the urban style of the medieval period. Instead of the bell tower, the church has a [[zvonnitsa]], an architectural form especially used in the [[Russian architecture]] of the 14th\u201317th centuries. Church of the Resurrection was used by the local Roman Catholic community during the Habsburg occupation, and then by the Ruthenian Greek Catholic community, until 1936. It is also known as ''V\u0103scresenia Church'' or ''Elena Doamna'' Church.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Nicholas]] (Pr\u0103jescu) is another religious building in Suceava that features the medieval Moldavian architectural style. The present church was rebuilt by treasurer Nicoar\u0103 Pr\u0103jescu in 1611, during the reign of Constantin Movil\u0103 (1607\u20131611). Throughout its history, the church functioned as a necropolis for the local [[boyar]]s.\n\nBetween the city center and I\u021bcani neighborhood, on the slopes that descend to the [[Suceava (river)|Suceava river valley]], there is Church of the Assumption, another old Romanian Orthodox church, founded in the first half of the 17th century (1639). The church was built on the place where I\u021bcani Monastery existed before. It functioned as a nunnery until late 18th century. Today it is parish church, and has a zvonnitsa similar to that of Church of the Resurrection, located downtown.\n\nIn Burdujeni neighborhood, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, there is Teodoreni Monastery, founded in 1597 by local boyar Teodor Movil\u0103, the elder brother of [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]], ruler of Moldavia (1595\u20131600, 1600\u20131606). Burdujeni village (now a district of Suceava) was established and developed around this monastery. The set of buildings includes Church of Ascension, the bell tower, living quarters for nuns and a surrounding wall. Just {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of Teodoreni Monastery, in the old district of Burdujeni, there is Church of the Holy Trinity, founded by archimandrite Filaret Scriban in 1851.\n\nI\u021bcani neighborhood has two Romanian Orthodox churches founded in the first half of the 20th century: Church of the Holy Archangels (built near [[Suceava North railway station]], in 1933\u20131938) and Church of the Holy Apostles (located on [[European route E85]] and built in 1905\u20131908 by the German community of I\u021bcani, initially as a Lutheran church).\n\n[[Church of the Holy Cross, P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi|Church of the Holy Cross]], located in [[P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi]] village (a few miles north-west of I\u021bcani), was founded in 1487 by Stephen the Great, and is one of the monuments that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Also not far away from I\u021bcani, there is [[Dragomirna Monastery]], established by clergyman [[Anastasie Crimca]] in 1609. [[Vorone\u021b Monastery]] is located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Suceava, in the town of [[Gura Humorului]].\n\n====German Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches====\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Biserica Sf.

Their cultural and historical legacy is highlighted by a series of well preserved religious buildings that still exist to this today.\n\nThe most representative ecclesiastical landmark established by the local Armenian population is Zamca Monastery (the term Zamca can actually trace its linguistic origin to [[Polish language|Polish]], denoting as such a 'fortified place' and being named this way by [[List of Polish monarchs|King]] [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] in 1691), a fortified complex of buildings located on a plateau at the western point of the contemporary city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calatoresc.ro/descopera-orasul-suceava/|author=Isabela|work=c\u0103l\u0103toresc.ro|title=Descoper\u0103 ora\u0219ul Suceava (in Romanian)|date=2 October 2013|accessdate= 28 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nZamca Monastery was constructed between 1551 and 1606 and its church is dedicated to Saint Auxentius. Along with the church, the monastery includes several buildings made of stone and a defensive wall that surrounds the whole medieval complex.\n\nBetween Zamca Monastery and the city center there are two more Armenian Orthodox churches. Church of Saint Simon (also known as The Red Tower Church because of its bell tower) was founded in 1513. The bell tower was constructed in 1551.\n\nThe church has an old Armenian cemetery in the proximity and a chapel that was built in 1902 (Pruncul Chapel). Church of the Holy Cross was established in 1521 and was renovated several times in its history. The Armenian parsonage is located near the church, along with several old tomb stones.\n\nHagigadar Monastery is another medieval complex built by the local Armenians. It was founded in 1512\u20131513, and is located on the south-western proximity of the city, on a valley near [[European route E85]].\n\n==Tourism==\n\nIn the past few years Suceava started to evolve more rapidly.

The control was then transferred to the UN administration of [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]].

The parliaments of all Yugoslavian republics and provinces, which until then had MPs only from the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], were dissolved and multi-party elections were held within them. Kosovar Albanians refused to participate in the elections so they held their own unsanctioned elections instead. As election laws required (and still require) turnout higher than 50%, a parliament in Kosovo could not be established.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe new constitution abolished the individual provinces' official media, integrating them within the official media of Serbia while still retaining some programs in the [[Albanian language]]. The Albanian-language media in Kosovo were suppressed. Funding was withdrawn from state-owned media, including those in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The constitution made the creation of privately owned media possible, however their operation was very difficult because of high rents and restrictive laws. State-owned Albanian language television or radio was also banned from broadcasting from Kosovo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060608223221/http://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm |archivedate=8 June 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, privately owned Albanian media outlets appeared; of these, probably the most famous is \"Koha Ditore\", which was allowed to operate until late 1998 when it was closed after publishing a calendar glorifying ethnic Albanian separatists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe constitution also transferred control over state-owned companies to the Yugoslav central government. In September 1990, up to 123,000 Albanian workers were dismissed from their positions in government and media, as were teachers, doctors, and civil servants,<ref>[http://www.bndlg.de/~wplarre/back337.htm ON THE RECORD: //Civil Society in Kosovo// - Volume 9, Issue 1 - August 30, 1999 - THE BIRTH AND REBIRTH OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN KOSOVO - PART ONE: REPRESSION AND RESISTANCE]</ref> provoking a [[general strike]] and mass unrest. Some of those who were not sacked quit in sympathy, refusing to work for the Serbian government. Although the sackings were widely seen as a purge of ethnic Albanians, the government maintained that it was removing former communist directors.\n\nAlbanian educational curriculum textbooks were withdrawn and replaced by new ones. The curriculum was (and still is, as this is the curriculum used for Albanians in Serbia outside Kosovo) identical to its Serbian counterpart and that of all other nationalities in Serbia except that it had education on and in the Albanian language.

The parliaments of all Yugoslavian republics and provinces, which until then had MPs only from the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], were dissolved and multi-party elections were held within them. Kosovar Albanians refused to participate in the elections so they held their own unsanctioned elections instead. As election laws required (and still require) turnout higher than 50%, a parliament in Kosovo could not be established.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe new constitution abolished the individual provinces' official media, integrating them within the official media of Serbia while still retaining some programs in the [[Albanian language]]. The Albanian-language media in Kosovo were suppressed. Funding was withdrawn from state-owned media, including those in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The constitution made the creation of privately owned media possible, however their operation was very difficult because of high rents and restrictive laws. State-owned Albanian language television or radio was also banned from broadcasting from Kosovo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060608223221/http://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm |archivedate=8 June 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, privately owned Albanian media outlets appeared; of these, probably the most famous is \"Koha Ditore\", which was allowed to operate until late 1998 when it was closed after publishing a calendar glorifying ethnic Albanian separatists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe constitution also transferred control over state-owned companies to the Yugoslav central government.

Some of those who were not sacked quit in sympathy, refusing to work for the Serbian government. Although the sackings were widely seen as a purge of ethnic Albanians, the government maintained that it was removing former communist directors.\n\nAlbanian educational curriculum textbooks were withdrawn and replaced by new ones. The curriculum was (and still is, as this is the curriculum used for Albanians in Serbia outside Kosovo) identical to its Serbian counterpart and that of all other nationalities in Serbia except that it had education on and in the Albanian language.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\".

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

The ship [[:wikt:founder#Verb|foundered]] after sailing about 1,300 m (1,400 yd) into her [[maiden voyage]] on 10 August 1628. She fell into obscurity after most of her valuable [[bronze]] [[cannon]] were salvaged in the 17th century until she was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping lane just outside [[Stockholm]] harbor. The ship was salvaged with a largely intact hull in 1961. She was housed in a temporary museum called Wasavarvet (\"The Vasa Shipyard\") until 1988 and then moved permanently to the [[Vasa Museum]] in the [[Royal National City Park]]<ref>\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273141855_The_Formation_of_National_Urban_Parks_a_Nordic_Contribution_to_Sustainable_Development Schantz, P. 2006.

She was constructed at the navy yard in Stockholm under a contract with private entrepreneurs in 1626\u20131627 and armed primarily with bronze cannons cast in Stockholm specifically for the ship. Richly decorated as a symbol of the king's ambitions for Sweden and himself, upon completion she was one of the most powerfully armed vessels in the world. However, ''Vasa'' was dangerously unstable, with too much weight in the upper structure of the hull. Despite this lack of stability, she was ordered to sea and foundered only a few minutes after encountering a wind stronger than a breeze.\n\nThe order to sail was the result of a combination of factors. The king, who was leading the army in Poland at the time of her maiden voyage, was impatient to see her take up her station as [[flagship]] of the reserve squadron at [[\u00c4lvsnabben]] in the Stockholm Archipelago. At the same time the king's subordinates lacked the political courage to openly discuss the ship's problems or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organised by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish Privy Council]] to find those responsible for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished.\n\nDuring the 1961 recovery, thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around ''Vasa'''s hull by [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeologists]]. Among the many items found were clothing, weapons, cannons, tools, coins, cutlery, food, drink and six of the ten sails. The artifacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques and everyday life in early 17th-century Sweden. Today Vasa is the world's best preserved 17th century ship and the most visited museum in Scandinavia. <ref>https://www.vasamuseet.se/en</ref>\n\n[[File:Vasa D81 2634 (45754508634).jpg|thumb|304px|Vasa's upper transom in Vasa Museum 2018]]\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|A map of Sweden's territorial gains and losses 1560\u20131815. In the years that ''Vasa'' was built and sank, Sweden still had not seized the southernmost of its present provinces, but possessed almost all of modern-day [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]] as well as [[Ingria]] and [[Karelia]].]]\n\nDuring the 17th century, Sweden went from being a sparsely populated, poor, and peripheral northern European kingdom of little influence to one of the [[Great power|major powers]] in continental politics. Between 1611 and 1718 it was the dominant power in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], eventually gaining territory that encompassed the Baltic on all sides. This rise to prominence in international affairs and increase in military prowess, called ''[[Swedish Empire|stormaktstiden]]'' (\"age of greatness\" or \"great power period\"), was made possible by a succession of able monarchs and the establishment of a powerful centralised government, supporting a highly efficient military organization. Swedish historians have described this as one of the more extreme examples of an early modern state using almost all of its available resources to wage war; the small northern kingdom transformed itself into a [[fiscal-military state]] and one of the most militarised states in history.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 36\u201339; see also Jan Glete's paper ''[http://www2.historia.su.se/personal/jan_glete/Glete-Swedish_Fiscal-military_State.pdf The Swedish fiscal-military state and its navy, 1521\u20131721]''.</ref>\n\n[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] (1594\u20131632) has been considered one of the most successful Swedish kings in terms of success in warfare. When ''Vasa'' was built, he had been in power for more than a decade. Sweden was embroiled in a [[Polish-Swedish War (1625\u20131629)|war with Poland-Lithuania]], and looked apprehensively at the development of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in present-day Germany. The war had been raging since 1618 and from a [[Protestant]] perspective it was not successful. The king's plans for a Polish campaign and for securing Sweden's interests required a strong naval presence in the Baltic.<ref name=\"roberts\">Roberts (1953\u201358)</ref>\n\nThe navy suffered several severe setbacks during the 1620s. In 1625, a squadron cruising in the [[Bay of Riga]] was caught in a storm and ten ships ran aground and were wrecked. In the [[Battle of Oliwa]] in 1627, a Swedish squadron was outmaneuvered and defeated by a Polish force and two large ships were lost. ''Tigern'' (\"The Tiger\"), which was the Swedish admiral's flagship, was captured by the Poles, and ''Solen'' (\"The Sun\") was blown up by her own crew when it was boarded and nearly captured. In 1628, three more large ships were lost in less than a month; Admiral [[Clas Fleming (admiral)|Klas Fleming]]'s flagship ''Kristina'' was wrecked in a storm in the [[Gulf of Danzig]], ''Riksnyckeln'' (\"Key of the Realm\") ran aground at Viksten in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and ''Vasa'' foundered on her maiden voyage. Gustavus Adolphus was engaged in naval warfare on several fronts, which further exacerbated the difficulties of the navy. In addition to battling the Polish navy, the Swedes were indirectly threatened by Imperial forces that had invaded [[Jutland]]. The Swedish king had little sympathy for the Danish king, [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], and Denmark and Sweden had been bitter enemies for well over a century. However, Sweden feared a Catholic conquest of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. This would have granted the Catholic powers control over the strategic passages between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]], which would be disastrous for Swedish interests.<ref name=\"roberts\" /><ref name=\"Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47\">Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 47.</ref>\n\nUntil the early 17th century, the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium-sized ships with a single gundeck, normally armed with 12-pounder and smaller cannons; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well-suited for escort and patrol. They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy, which emphasised boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery. The king, who was a keen artillerist, saw the potential of ships as gun platforms, and large, heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power. Beginning with ''Vasa'', he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks, outfitted with much heavier guns.<ref>Hocker (2011), p. 147</ref> Five such ships were built after ''Vasa'' (''\u00c4pplet'', ''Kronan'', ''Scepter'' and ''G\u00f6ta Ark'') before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king's death in 1632. These ships, especially ''Kronan'' and ''Scepter'', were much more successful and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s. The second of the so-called ''regalskepp'' (usually translated as \"royal ships\"),<ref>''Vasa'' was actually never referred to as a ''regalskepp'' before it was lost, but was classified as one afterwards; Hocker (2011), pp. 147\u201348.</ref> ''\u00c4pplet'' (\"The Apple\"; the Swedish term for the [[globus cruciger]]), was built simultaneously with ''Vasa''. The only significant difference between the design of ''Vasa'' and her sister ship was an increase in width of about a metre (3.1&nbsp;ft).<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 39; for more on ''\u00c4pplet'', see {{in lang|sv}} Jan Glete, \"[https://www.webcitation.org/5hFXgHHMe?url=http://www.marinarkeologi.net/pdf/mt4-2002_16-21.pdf Gustav II Adolfs \u00c4pplet]\" in ''Marinarkeologisk tidskrift'' nr 4, 2002.</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n[[Image:Vasa Top Deck.jpg|thumb|left|''Vasa's'' [[Port (nautical)|port]] side]]\n\nJust before ''Vasa'' was ordered, Dutch-born [[Henrik Hybertsson]] (\"Master Henrik\") was shipwright at the Stockholm shipyard. On 16 January 1625, Master Henrik and business partner Arendt de Groote signed a contract to build four ships, two with a [[keel]] of around {{convert|135|ft|m}} and two smaller ones of {{convert|108|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"sa\">Sandstr\u00f6m (1982)</ref>\n\nMaster Henrik and Arendt de Groote began buying the raw materials needed for the first ships in 1625, purchasing timber from individual estates in Sweden as well as buying rough-sawn planking in [[Riga]], K\u00f6nigsberg (modern [[Kaliningrad]]), and [[Amsterdam]]. As they prepared to begin the first of the new ships in the autumn of 1625, Henrik corresponded with the king through Vice Admiral Klas Fleming about which ship to build first. The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga led the king to propose building two ships of a new, medium size as a quick compromise, and he sent a specification for this, a ship which would be 120 feet (35.6 m) long on the keel. Henrik declined, since he had already cut the timber for a large and a small ship. He laid the keel for a larger ship in late February or early March 1626.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 43\u201344.</ref> Master Henrik never saw Vasa completed; he fell ill in late 1625, and by the summer of 1626 he had handed over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright, Henrik \"Hein\" Jacobsson. He died in the spring of 1627, probably about the same time as the ship was launched.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 41.</ref>\n\nAfter launching, work continued on finishing the upper deck, the sterncastle, the [[beakhead]] and the rigging. Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry, and material had to be ordered from abroad. In the contract for the maintenance of rigging, French sailcloth was specified, but the cloth for the sails of ''Vasa'' most likely came from Holland.<ref>Hocker (2011), p. 94.</ref> The sails were made mostly of [[hemp]] and partly of [[flax]]. The rigging was made entirely of hemp imported from [[Latvia]] through Riga. The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47\u201350.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vasas hull profile.jpg|thumb|upright|A model showing a cross section of ''Vasa''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hull, illustrating the shallow [[hold (ship)|hold]] and two [[gun deck]]s]]\n\nIn the summer of 1628, the captain responsible for supervising construction of the ship, S\u00f6fring Hansson, arranged for the ship's stability to be demonstrated for Vice Admiral Fleming, who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia. Thirty men ran back and forth across the upper deck to start the ship rolling, but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips, as he feared the ship would capsize. According to testimony by the ship's master, G\u00f6ran Mattson, Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home. Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship put to sea as soon as possible.<ref name=\"Vasa\">Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 53.</ref>\n\nThere has been much speculation about whether ''Vasa'' was lengthened during construction and whether an additional gun deck was added late during the build. Little evidence suggests that ''Vasa'' was substantially modified after the keel was laid. Ships contemporary to ''Vasa'' that were elongated were cut in half and new timbers spliced between the existing sections, making the addition readily identifiable, but no such addition can be identified in the hull, nor is there any evidence for any late additions of a second gundeck. The king ordered 72 24-pound guns for the ship on 5 August 1626, and this was too many to fit on a single gun deck. Since the king's order was issued less than five months after construction started, it would have come early enough for the second deck to be included in the design. The French ''Galion du Guise'', the ship used as a model for ''Vasa'', according to Arendt de Groote, also had two gun decks.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 45\u201346.</ref> [[3D scanner|Laser measurements]] of ''Vasa's'' structure conducted in 2007\u20132011 confirmed that no major changes were implemented during construction, but that the centre of gravity was too high.<ref>Hocker (2011), pp. 39\u201341.</ref>\n\n''Vasa'' was an early example of a warship with two full gun decks, and was built when the theoretical principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood. There is no evidence that Henrik Hybertsson had ever built a ship like it before, and two gundecks is a much more complicated compromise between seaworthiness and firepower than a single gundeck. Safety margins at the time were also far below anything that would be acceptable today. Combined with the fact that 17th-century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures (to be used as firing platforms), this made ''Vasa'' a risky undertaking.<ref>Fred Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:Vasa-lower gun deck-2.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of the lower gun deck looking toward the bow]]\n\n''Vasa'' was built during a time of transition in naval tactics, from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organised [[ship-of-the-line]] and a focus on victory through superior gunnery. ''Vasa'' was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern, which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers it was supposed to carry, but the high-sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimised for boarding. It was neither the largest ship ever built, nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns. What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannon of one side: 588 pounds (267&nbsp;kg), excluding ''stormstycken'', guns used for firing anti-personnel ammunition instead of solid shot. This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time, perhaps in all of northern Europe, and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built. This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried. By comparison, ''[[USS Constitution]]'', a frigate built by the United States 169 years after ''Vasa'', had roughly the same firepower, but was over 700&nbsp;[[tonnes]] heavier.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 49.</ref>\n\nThe ''Constitution'', however, belonged to a later era of naval warfare that employed the [[line of battle]]-tactic, where ships fought in single file (or ''line ahead'') while the group as a whole attempted to present the batteries of one side toward the enemy. The guns would be aimed in the same direction and fire could be concentrated on a single target. In the 17th century, tactics involving organised formations of large fleets had still not been developed. Rather, ships would fight individually or in small improvised groups, and focused on boarding. ''Vasa'', though possessing a formidable battery, was built with these tactics in mind, and therefore lacked a unified [[broadside]] with guns that were all aimed in roughly the same direction. Rather, the guns were intended to be fired independently and were arranged according to the curvature of the hull, meaning that the ship would be bristled with artillery in all directions, covering virtually all angles.<ref>The guns facing fight aft, the ''stern chasers'', were still not on board when the ship sank, however; Hocker (2011) pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\nNaval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy. Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship. Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of, while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years. In Sweden and many other European countries, a ship would normally not \"own\" its guns, but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season. Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size. What allowed ''Vasa'' to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship, but also that the 46 main 24-pounder guns were of a new and standardised lightweight design, cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm, under the direction of the Swiss-born founder Medardus Gessus. Two additional 24-pounders, of a heavier and older design, were mounted in the bows, the so-called ''[[Chase gun|bow chasers]]''. Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern, but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships, and ''Vasa'' waited nearly a year after construction was finished for its armament. When the ship sailed in August 1628, eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered. All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused, but ''Vasa's'' guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimetres, and their bores were almost exactly 146&nbsp;mm (5.7&nbsp;in). The remaining armament of ''Vasa'' consisted of eight 3-pounders, six large caliber ''stormstycken'' (similar to what the English called [[howitzer]]s) for use during boarding actions, and two 1-pound [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]]. Also included on board were 894 kilograms (1,970&nbsp;lb) of [[gunpowder]] and over 1,000 shot of various types for the guns.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47\u201351.</ref>\n\n=== Ornamentation ===\n[[Image:Vasa stern color model.jpg|thumb|A 1:10 scale model of the ship on display at the [[Vasa Museum]]. The sculptures are painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]\nAs was the custom with warships at the time, parts of ''Vasa'' were decorated with sculptures.\nResidues of paint have been found on many sculptures and on other parts of the ship. The entire ornamentation was once painted in vivid colors. The sides of the [[beakhead]] (the protruding structure below the [[bowsprit]]), the bulwarks (the protective railing around the weather deck), the roofs of the [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], and the background of the [[Transom (nautical)|transom]] (the flat surface at the stern of the ship) were all painted red, while the sculptures were decorated in bright colors, and the dazzling effect of these was in some places emphasised with [[gold leaf]]. Previously, it was believed that the background color had been blue and that all sculptures had been almost entirely gilded, and this is reflected in many paintings of ''Vasa'' from the 1970s to the early 1990s, such as the lively and dramatic drawings of [[Bj\u00f6rn Landstr\u00f6m]] or the painting by Francis Smitheman.<ref>See sample from Smitheman's website here [http://www.smitheman.com/004-full.html].</ref> In the late 1990s, this view was revised and the colors are properly reflected in more recent reproductions of the ship's decoration by maritime painter [[Tim Thompson (artist)|Tim Thompson]] and the 1:10 scale model in the museum. ''Vasa'' is an example not so much of the heavily gilded sculptures of early [[Baroque]] art but rather \"the last gasps of the [[medieval art|medieval]] sculpture tradition\" with its fondness for gaudy colors, in a style that today would be considered extravagant or even vulgar.<ref name=\"Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47\"/>\n\n[[File:Vasaskultpurrepliker.jpg|thumb|left|Modern replicas in the [[Vasa Museum]] of some of the ship's sculptures that have been painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]\nThe sculptures are carved out of [[oak]], [[pine]] or [[Tilia|linden]], and many of the larger pieces, like the huge 3-metre (10&nbsp;ft) long figurehead lion, consist of several parts carved individually and fitted together with bolts. Close to 500 sculptures, most of which are concentrated on the high stern and its galleries and on the beakhead, are found on the ship.<ref>Soop (1986), pp. 20\u201321.</ref> The figure of [[Hercules]] appears as a pair of pendants, one younger and one older, on each side of the lower stern galleries; the pendants depict opposite aspects of the ancient hero, who was extremely popular during antiquity as well as in 17th-century European art. On the transom are biblical and nationalistic symbols and images. A particularly popular motif is the lion, which can be found as the [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascarons]] originally fitted on the insides of the gunport doors, grasping the royal coat of arms on either side, the figurehead, and even clinging to the top of the rudder. Each side of the beakhead originally had 20 figures (though only 19 have actually been found) that depicted [[Roman emperor]]s from [[Tiberius]] to [[Septimius Severus]]. Overall, almost all heroic and positive imagery is directly or indirectly identified with the king and was originally intended to glorify him as a wise and powerful ruler. The only actual portrait of the king, however, is located at the very top of the transom in the stern. Here he is depicted as a young boy with long, flowing hair, being crowned by two [[griffin]]s representing the king's father, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]].<ref>Before being crowned as king, Charles had been duke of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], whose coat of arms include a griffin [[segreant]], standing with its front legs raised; Soop (1986), pp. 18\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vasa color pigments.jpg|thumb|A recreation of the color pigments that were used by the naval shipyard where the ship was built; exhibit at the [[Vasa Museum]].]]\nA team of at least six expert sculptors worked for a minimum of two years on the sculptures, most likely with the assistance of an unknown number of apprentices and assistants. No direct credit for any of the sculptures has been provided, but the distinct style of one of the most senior artists, M\u00e5rten Redtmer, is clearly identifiable. Other accomplished artists, like Hans Clausink, Johan Didrichson Tijsen (or ''Thessen'' in Swedish) and possibly Marcus Ledens, are known to have been employed for extensive work at the naval yards at the time ''Vasa'' was built, but their respective styles are not distinct enough to associate them directly with any specific sculptures.<ref>Soop (1986), pp. 241\u2013253.</ref>\n\nThe artistic quality of the sculptures varies considerably, and about four distinct styles can be identified. The only artist who has been positively associated with various sculptures is M\u00e5rten Redtmer, whose style has been described as \"powerful, lively and naturalistic\".<ref>Soop (1986), p. 247.</ref> He was responsible for a considerable number of the sculptures. These include some of the most important and prestigious pieces: the figurehead lion, the royal coat of arms, and the sculpture of the king at the top of the transom. Two of the other styles are described as \"elegant ... a little stereotyped and manneristic\", and of a \"heavy, leisurely but nevertheless rich and lively style\", respectively. The fourth and last style, deemed clearly inferior to the other three, is described as \"stiff and ungainly\"<ref>Quotes from Soop (1986), p. 252.</ref> and was done by other carvers, perhaps even apprentices, of lesser skill.<ref>Soop, pp. 241\u2013253</ref>\n\n== Maiden voyage ==\n[[Image:Voyage of the Vasa 2.svg|thumb|Central [[Stockholm]] and the movements of ''Vasa'' from Skeppsg\u00e5rden ('navy yard') to the anchoring place near the old royal castle where it was fitted and armed in the spring of 1628, and finally the location where it foundered and sank.]]\n\nOn 10 August 1628, Captain S\u00f6fring Hansson ordered ''Vasa'' to depart on her maiden voyage to the naval station at [[\u00c4lvsnabben]]. The day was calm, and the only wind was a light breeze from the southwest. The ship was [[Warping (sailing)|warped]] (hauled by anchor) along the eastern waterfront of the city to the southern side of the harbor, where four sails were set, and the ship made way to the east. The gun ports were open, and the guns were out to fire a salute as the ship left Stockholm.<ref name=\"Vasa\"/>\n\nAs ''Vasa'' passed under the [[Lee side|lee]] of the bluffs to the south (what is now [[S\u00f6dermalm]]), a gust of wind filled her sails, and she [[Heel (sailing)|heeled]] suddenly to [[Port (nautical)|port]]. The [[Sheet (sailing)|sheets]] were cast off, and the ship slowly [[Metacentric height|righted herself]] as the gust passed. At Tegelviken, where there is a gap in the bluffs, an even stronger gust again forced the ship onto its port side, this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface, allowing water to rush in onto the lower gundeck. The water building up on the deck quickly exceeded the ship's minimal ability to right itself, and water continued to pour in until it ran down into the hold; the ship quickly sank to a depth of 32&nbsp;m (105&nbsp;ft) only 120&nbsp;m (390&nbsp;ft) from shore. Survivors clung to debris or the upper masts, which were still above the surface, to save themselves, and many nearby boats rushed to their aid, but despite these efforts and the short distance to land, 30 people perished with the ship, according to reports. ''Vasa'' sank in full view of a crowd of hundreds, if not thousands, of mostly ordinary Stockholmers who had come to see the great ship set sail. The crowd included foreign ambassadors, in effect spies of Gustavus Adolphus' allies and enemies, who also witnessed the catastrophe.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\n=== Inquest ===\nThe Council sent a letter to the king the day after the loss, telling him of the sinking, but it took over two weeks to reach him in Poland. \"Imprudence and negligence\" must have been the cause, he wrote angrily in his reply, demanding in no uncertain terms that the guilty parties be punished.<ref name=\"kv2535\"/> Captain S\u00f6fring Hansson, who survived the disaster, was immediately taken for questioning. Under initial interrogation, he swore that the guns had been properly secured and that the crew was sober. A full inquest before a tribunal of members of the Privy Council and Admiralty took place at the [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Royal Palace]] on 5 September 1628. Each of the surviving officers was questioned as was the supervising shipwright and a number of expert witnesses. Also present at the inquest was the Admiral of the Realm, [[Carl Gyllenhielm|Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm]]. The object of the inquest was as much or more to find a scapegoat as to find out why the ship had sunk.

Was it rigged properly for the wind? Was the crew sober? Was the ballast properly stowed? Were the guns properly secured? However, no-one was prepared to take the blame. Crewmen and contractors formed two camps; each tried to blame the other, and everyone swore he had done his duty without fault and it was during the inquest that the details of the stability demonstration were revealed.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 29\u201335; Hocker in Cederlund (2006); pp. 55\u201360.</ref>\n\nNext, attention was directed to the shipbuilders. \"Why did you build the ship so narrow, so badly and without enough bottom that it capsized?\" the prosecutor asked the shipwright Jacobsson.<ref name=\"Vasa_2\">Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 36.</ref> Jacobsson stated that he built the ship as directed by Henrik Hybertsson (long since dead and buried), who in turn had followed the specification approved by the king. Jacobsson had in fact widened the ship by 1 foot 5 inches (c. 42&nbsp;cm) after taking over responsibility for the construction, but construction of the ship was too far advanced to allow further widening.<ref name=\"Vasa_2\"/>\n\nIn the end, no guilty party could be found. The answer Arendt de Groote gave when asked by the court why the ship sank was \"Only God knows\". Gustavus Adolphus had approved all measurements and armaments, and the ship was built according to the instructions and loaded with the number of guns specified. In the end, no-one was punished or found guilty for negligence, and the blame effectively fell on Henrik Hybertsson.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 25\u201332.</ref>\n\n== ''Vasa'' as a wreck ==\n[[Image:17th century salvaging.jpg|thumb|Illustration from a treatise on salvaging from 1734, showing the traditional method of raising a wreck with the help of [[anchor]]s and ships or [[hulk (ship)|hulks]] as [[Float (nautical)|pontoons]], basically the same method that was used to raise ''Vasa'' in the 20th century.]]\n\nLess than three days after the disaster, a contract was signed for the ship to be raised. However, those efforts were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Hafstr\u00f6m in Vasa I, p. 69\">Hafstr\u00f6m in Cederlund (2006), p. 69.</ref> The earliest attempts at raising ''Vasa'' by English engineer Ian Bulmer,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QhVhBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT54|title=Shipwreck: A History of Disasters at Sea|last=Willis|first=Sam|year=2013|publisher=Quercus|isbn=978-1-78206-522-7|location=|pages=54|language=en}}</ref> resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery.<ref name=\"Hafstr\u00f6m in Vasa I, p. 69\"/> Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today, but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise ''Vasa'' more than 300 years later. Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck, and ropes attached to several [[anchor]]s were sent down and hooked to the ship. The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe, the ropes tightened, and the water pumped out. The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters. The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level. Even if the underwater weight of ''Vasa'' was not great, the mud in which it had settled made it sit more securely on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome.<ref>Hafstr\u00f6m in Cederlund (2006), pp. 98\u2013104.</ref> More than 30 years after the ship's sinking, in 1663\u20131665, Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns. With a simple [[diving bell]], the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them.<ref>Hafstr\u00f6m in Cederlund (2006), pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nSuch activity waned when it became clear that the ship could not be raised by the technology of the time. However, ''Vasa'' did not fall completely into obscurity after the recovery of the guns. The ship was mentioned in several histories of Sweden and the Swedish Navy, and the location of the wreck appeared on harbor charts of Stockholm in the 19th century. In 1844, the navy officer Anton Ludwig Fahnehjelm turned in a request for salvaging rights to the ship, claiming he had located it. Fahnehjelm was an inventor who designed an early form of light diving suit and had previously been involved in other salvage operations. There were dives made on the wreck in 1895\u20131896, and a commercial salvage company applied for a permit to raise or salvage the wreck in 1920, but this was turned down. In 1999, a witness also claimed that his father, a petty officer in the Swedish navy, had taken part in diving exercises on ''Vasa'' in the years before World War I.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 142\u2013143.</ref>\n\n=== Deterioration ===\n[[File:Vasa-knightheads.jpg|thumb|left|Two of the knightheads, posts used to fasten ropes, on the weather deck. The details of carved heads have been eroded almost beyond recognition by the currents of [[Stockholms str\u00f6m]].]]\nIn the 333 years that ''Vasa'' lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor (called [[Stockholms str\u00f6m]], \"the Stream\", in Swedish), the ship and its contents were subject to several destructive forces, first among which were decomposition and erosion. Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the [[beakhead]] and much of the sterncastle together, and this included all of the ship's wooden sculptures. Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking, and only large objects, such as anchors, or items made of cast iron, such as cannonballs, survived. Organic materials fared better in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions, and so wood, cloth and leather are often in very good condition, but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water, so that some are barely recognizable.<ref name=\"Hocker pp. 153\">Hocker & Wendel in Cederlund (2006), pp. 153\u2013170.</ref> Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected, so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding. Of the human remains, most of the soft tissue was quickly consumed by bacteria, fish and crustaceans, leaving only the bones, which were often held together only by clothing, although in one case, hair, nails and brain tissue survived.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 146\u2013152.</ref>\n\nThe parts of the hull held together by joinery and wooden treenails remained intact for as much as two centuries, suffering gradual erosion of surfaces exposed to the water, unless they were disturbed by outside forces.\nEventually the entire sterncastle, the high, aft portion of the ship that housed the officers' quarters and held up the transom, gradually collapsed into the mud with all the decorative sculptures. The [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], which were merely nailed to the sides of the sterncastle, collapsed fairly quickly and were found lying almost directly below their original locations.<ref name=\"Hocker pp. 153\"/>\n\nHuman activity was the most destructive factor, as the initial salvage efforts, the recovery of the guns, and the final salvage in the 20th century all left their marks. Peckell and Treileben broke up and removed much of the planking of the weather deck to get to the cannons on the decks below. Peckell reported that he had recovered 30 cartloads of wood from the ship; these might have included not just planking and structural details but also some of the sculptures which today are missing, such as the life-size Roman warrior near the bow and the sculpture of [[Septimius Severus]] that adorned the port side of the [[beakhead]].<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 154.</ref> Since ''Vasa'' lay in a busy shipping channel, ships occasionally dropped anchor over the ship, and one large anchor demolished most of the upper sterncastle, probably in the 19th century. Construction work in Stockholm harbor usually results in blasting of bedrock, and the resulting tonnes of rubble were often dumped in the harbor; some of this landed on the ship, causing further damage to the stern and the upper deck.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 151\u2013152.</ref>\n\n=== ''Vasa'' rediscovered ===\nIn the early 1950s, amateur [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Anders Franz\u00e9n]] considered the possibility of recovering wrecks from the cold [[brackish]] waters of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] because, he reasoned, they were free from the [[shipworm]] ''Teredo navalis'', which usually destroys submerged wood rapidly in warmer, saltier seas. Franz\u00e9n had previously been successful in locating wrecks such as ''Riks\u00e4pplet'' and ''Lybska Svan'', and after long and tedious research he began looking for ''Vasa'' as well. He spent many years probing the waters without success around the many assumed locations of the wreckage. He did not succeed until, based on accounts of an unknown topographical anomaly just south of the Gustav V dock on [[Beckholmen]], he narrowed his search. In 1956, with a home-made, gravity-powered coring probe, he located a large wooden object almost parallel to the mouth of dock on Beckholmen. The location of the ship received considerable attention, even if the identification of the ship could not be determined without closer investigation. Soon after the announcement of the find, planning got underway to determine how to excavate and raise ''Vasa''. The [[Swedish Navy]] was involved from the start, as were various museums and the National Heritage board, representatives of which eventually formed the ''Vasa'' Committee, the predecessor of the ''Vasa'' Board.<ref>''Vasa I'', Cederlund and Hocker, pp. 172\u2013180</ref>\n[[Image:Zetterstr\u00f6m nozzle1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Zetterstr\u00f6m nozzle]], designed to expel equal amounts of water both forwards and backwards for recoilless operation under water.]]\n\n=== Recovery ===\n[[File:Vasa 14 maj 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Hulk of ''Vasa'' after recovery operations, May 14, 1961]]\nA number of possible recovery methods were proposed, including filling the ship with ping-pong balls and freezing it in a block of ice, but the method chosen by the Vasa Board (which succeeded the Vasa Committee) was essentially the same one attempted immediately after the sinking. Divers spent two years digging six tunnels under the ship for steel cable slings, which were taken to a pair of lifting [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] at the surface. The work under the ship was extremely dangerous, requiring the divers to cut tunnels through the clay with high-pressure water jets and suck up the resulting slurry with a dredge, all while working in total darkness with hundreds of tonnes of mud-filled ship overhead.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 234\u2013244.</ref> A persisting risk was that the wreck could shift or settle deeper into the mud while a diver was working in a tunnel, trapping him underneath the wreckage. The almost vertical sections of the tunnels near the side of the hull could also potentially collapse and bury a diver inside.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 252.</ref> Despite the dangerous conditions, more than 1,300 dives were made in the [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operation without any serious accidents.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 61\u201369.</ref>\n\nEach time the pontoons were pumped full, the cables tightened and the pontoons were pumped out, the ship was brought a metre closer to the surface. In a series of 18 lifts in August and September 1959, the ship was moved from depth of 32 metres (105&nbsp;ft) to 16 metres (52&nbsp;ft) in the more sheltered area of Kastellholmsviken, where divers could work more safely to prepare for the final lift.<ref>Kvarning (1998), p. 69.</ref> Over the course of a year and a half, a small team of commercial divers cleared debris and mud from the upper decks to lighten the ship, and made the hull as watertight as possible. The gun ports were closed by means of temporary lids, a temporary replacement of the collapsed sterncastle was constructed, and many of the holes from the iron bolts that had rusted away were plugged. The final lift began on 8 April 1961, and on the morning of 24 April, ''Vasa'' was ready to return to the world for the first time in 333 years. Press from all over the world, television cameras, 400 invited guests on barges and boats, and thousands of spectators on shore watched as the first timbers broke the surface. The ship was then emptied of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V [[dry dock]] on Beckholmen, where the ship was floated on its own keel onto a concrete pontoon, on which the hull still stands.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 285\u2013290.</ref>\n\nFrom the end of 1961 to December 1988, ''Vasa'' was housed in a temporary facility called Wasavarvet (\"The Vasa Shipyard\"), which included exhibit space as well as the activities centred on the ship. A building was erected over the ship on its pontoon, but it was very cramped, making conservation work awkward. Visitors could view the ship from just two levels, and the maximum viewing distance was in most places only a couple of metres, which made it difficult for viewers to get an overall view of the ship. In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent building was to be constructed, and a design competition was organised. The winning design, by the Swedish architects M\u00e5nsson and Dahlb\u00e4ck, called for a large hall over the ship in a polygonal, industrial style. Ground was broken in 1987, and ''Vasa'' was towed into the half-finished [[Vasa Museum]] in December 1988. The museum was officially opened to the public in 1990.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 163\u2013173.</ref>\n\n== Archaeology ==\n''Vasa'' posed an unprecedented challenge for archaeologists. Never before had a four-story structure, with most of its original contents largely undisturbed, been available for excavation.<ref>Cederlund & Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 298.</ref> The conditions under which the team had to work added to the difficulties. The ship had to be kept wet in order that it not dry out and crack before it could be properly conserved. Digging had to be performed under a constant drizzle of water and in a sludge-covered mud that could be more than one metre (approximately three feet) deep. In order to establish find locations, the hull was divided into several sections demarcated by the many structural beams, the decking and by a line drawn along the centre of the ship from stern to bow. For the most part, the decks were excavated individually, though at times work progressed on more than one deck level simultaneously.<ref>Cederlund & Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 300.</ref>\n\n=== Finds ===\n[[File:Br\u00e4dspel - Vasamuseet - 25364.jpg|thumb|A [[Backgammon]] set found on ''Vasa'', complete with [[dice]] and markers]]\n''Vasa'' had four preserved decks: the upper and lower gun decks, the hold and the [[Orlop deck|orlop]]. Because of the constraints of preparing the ship for conservation, the archaeologists had to work quickly, in 13-hour shifts during the first week of excavation. The upper gun deck was greatly disturbed by the various salvage projects between 1628 and 1961, and it contained not only material that had fallen down from the rigging and upper deck, but also more than three centuries of harbor refuse.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 315.</ref> The decks below were progressively less disturbed. The gundecks contained not just gun carriages, the three surviving cannons, and other objects of a military nature, but were also where most of the personal possessions of the sailors had been stored at the time of the sinking. These included a wide range of loose finds, as well as chests and casks with spare clothing and shoes, tools and materials for mending, money (in the form of low-denomination copper coins), privately purchased provisions, and all of the everyday objects needed for life at sea. Most of the finds are of wood, testifying not only to the simple life on board, but to the generally unsophisticated state of Swedish material culture in the early 17th century. The lower decks were primarily used for storage, and so the hold was filled with barrels of provisions and gunpowder, coils of anchor cable, iron shot for the guns, and the personal possessions of some of the officers. On the orlop deck, a small compartment contained six of the ship's ten sails, rigging spares, and the working parts for the ship's pumps. Another compartment contained the possessions of the ship's carpenter, including a large tool chest.<ref>Cederlund & Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 302\u2013305; for the item catalog, see [http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ this link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016142656/http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ |date=16 October 2007 }}.</ref>\n\nAfter the ship itself had been salvaged and excavated, the site of the loss was excavated thoroughly during 1963\u20131967. This produced many items of rigging tackle as well as structural timbers that had fallen off, particularly from the beakhead and sterncastle. Most of the sculptures that had decorated the exterior of the hull were also found in the mud, along with the ship's anchors and the skeletons of at least four people. The last object to be brought up was the nearly 12-metre-long [[longboat]], called ''esping'' in Swedish, found lying parallel to the ship and believed to have been towed by ''Vasa'' when it sank.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 470\u2013472.</ref>\n\nMany of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered, but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell. Among the best known of these was a statue of 20th-century Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]], which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (now known as [[Aalto University]]) the night before the final lift.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Ilta-Sanomat]] |url=http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |date=5 July 1961 |title=Vasan Veijarit |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |archivedate=13 July 2004 |accessdate=8 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Yle]] |date=28 April 2011 |title=Teekkarien kuningasj\u00e4yn\u00e4st\u00e4 puoli vuosisataa |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/teekkarien_kuningasjaynasta_puoli_vuosisataa/5350123 |trans-title=Half a century after the famous hack by the University of Technology students |language=Finnish |accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref> The inspiration for the hack was that Sweden had forbidden Nurmi from competing in the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States]].\n\n== Causes of sinking ==\n[[Image:Vasa Cohen 20006123a hr.jpg|thumb|Former Vasa Museum Director Klas Helmerson (left) explaining aspects of the sinking of the ship to then US Defense Secretary [[William Cohen]] (centre) and Swedish Defense Minister [[Bj\u00f6rn von Sydow]] (right).]]\n''Vasa'' sank because it had very little [[initial stability]], which can be thought of as resistance to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship. The [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]] is too high, and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over, and there is not enough [[righting moment]], force trying to make the ship return to an upright position. The reason that the ship has such a high centre of gravity is not due to the guns. These weighed little over 60 tonnes, or about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship. This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size. The problem is in the hull construction itself. The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, only 1.67 metres (5 feet 5\u00bd inches) tall, and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over-dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry, so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.<ref>Hocker (2011), pp. 132\u2013134.</ref>\n\nThe use of different measuring systems on either side of the vessel caused its mass to be distributed asymmetrically, heavier to port. During construction both [[Swedish feet]] and [[Amsterdam feet]] were in use by different teams. Archaeologists have found four rulers used by the workmen who built the ship. Two were calibrated in Swedish feet, which had 12 inches, while the other two measured Amsterdam feet, which had 11 inches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2012-02-23/new-clues-emerge-centuries-old-swedish-shipwreck|title=New Clues Emerge in Centuries-Old Swedish Shipwreck|work=Public Radio International |date=23 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the mathematical tools for calculating or predicting stability were still more than a century in the future, and 17th-century scientific ideas about how ships behaved in water were deeply flawed, the people associated with building and sailing ships for the Swedish navy were very much aware of the forces at work and their relationships to each other. In the last part of the inquest held after the sinking, a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank. Their discussion and conclusions show very clearly that they knew what had happened, and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains, who said that the ship did not have enough \"belly\" to carry the heavy upperworks.<ref name=\"Hocker (2011) 135-137\">Hocker (2011), pp. 135\u2013137.</ref>\n\nCommon practice of the time dictated that heavy guns were to be placed on the lower gun deck to decrease the weight on the upper gun deck and improve stability. The armament plans were changed many times during the build to either 24-pounders on the lower deck along with lighter 12-pounders on the upper deck or 24-pounders on both decks. The gun ports on the upper deck were the correct size for 12-pounders, but in the end the ship was finished with the heavy 24-pounders on both decks, and this may have contributed to poor stability.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 51.</ref>\n\n''Vasa'' might not have sunk on 10 August 1628, if the ship had been sailed with the gunports closed. Ships with multiple tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason, the gunport lids are made with a double lip which is designed to seal well enough to keep out most of the water. Captain S\u00f6fring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water, but by then it was too late. If he had done it before he sailed, ''Vasa'' might not have sunk on that day.<ref name=\"Hocker (2011) 135-137\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\n[[Image:Vasa 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''Vasa'' during the early stages of conservation at the Wasa Shipyard.]]\nAlthough ''Vasa'' was in surprisingly good condition after 333 years at the bottom of the sea, it would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry. The large bulk of ''Vasa'', over 600 cubic metres (21,000 cu ft) of oak timber, constituted an unprecedented conservation problem. After some debate on how to best preserve the ship, conservation was carried out by impregnation with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG), a method that has since become the standard treatment for large, waterlogged wooden objects, such as the 16th-century English ship ''[[Mary Rose]]''. ''Vasa'' was sprayed with PEG for 17 years, followed by a long period of slow drying, which is not yet entirely complete.<ref>Hocker (2011), pp. 192\u2013193.</ref>\n\nThe reason that ''Vasa'' was so well-preserved was not just that the [[shipworm]] that normally devours wooden ships was absent but also that the water of [[Stockholms str\u00f6m]] was heavily polluted until the late 20th century. The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving. This, along with the fact that ''Vasa'' had been newly built and was undamaged when it sank, contributed to her conservation. Unfortunately, the properties of the water also had a negative effect. Chemicals present in the water around ''Vasa'' had penetrated the wood, and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had disappeared. Once the ship was exposed to the air, reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds. In the late 1990s, spots of white and yellow residue were noticed on ''Vasa'' and some of the associated artefacts. These turned out to be [[sulfate]]-containing salts that had formed on the surface of the wood when [[sulfides]] reacted with atmospheric oxygen. The salts on the surface of ''Vasa'' and objects found in and around it are not a threat themselves (even if the discolouring may be distracting), but if they are from inside the wood, they may expand and crack the timber from inside. As of 2002, the amount of sulfuric acid in ''Vasa'''s hull was estimated to be more than 2 tonnes, and more is continually being created. Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another 5,000 kilograms (11,000&nbsp;lb) of acid at a rate of about 100 kilograms (220&nbsp;lb) per year; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely.<ref>Dal & Hall Roth (2002), pp. 38\u201339.</ref>\n\nWhile most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for ''Vasa'''s long-term decay is sulfuric acid, Ulla Westermark, professor of wood technology at [[Lule\u00e5 University of Technology]], has proposed another mechanism with her colleague B\u00f6rje Stenberg. Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]] in an acidic environment can generate [[formic acid]] and eventually liquify the wood. ''Vasa'' was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries, and therefore has a relatively low pH. Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present, and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition.<ref>{{in lang|sv}} [[Gothenburg University]] TV, ''[http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full Vetenskapslandet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430060203/http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full |date=30 April 2009 }}''.

Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible. A current problem is that the old [[oak]] of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength and the cradle that supports the ship does not match up very well with the distribution of weight and stress in the hull. \"The amount of movement in the hull is worrying. If nothing is done, the ship will most likely capsize again\", states Magnus Olofson from the ''Vasa'' Museum.

Small objects have been sealed in plastic containers filled with an inert atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] gas, for halting further reactions between sulfides and oxygen. The ship itself has been treated with cloth saturated in a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] liquid to neutralise the low pH, but this is only a temporary solution as acid is continuously produced. The original bolts rusted away after the ship sank but were replaced with modern ones that were [[galvanization|galvanised]] and covered with [[epoxy]] resin.

Within the disciplines of history and [[maritime archaeology]] the wrecks of large warships from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries have received particularly widespread attention as perceived symbols of a past greatness of the state of Sweden. Among these wrecks, ''Vasa'' is the single best known example, and has also become recognised internationally, not least through a deliberate use of the ship as a symbol for marketing Sweden abroad. The name ''Vasa'' has in Sweden become synonymous with sunken vessels that are considered to be of great historical importance, and these are usually described, explained and valued in relation to ''Vasa'' itself.<ref>Cederlund (1997), s. 38</ref> The Swedish maritime archaeologist Carl-Olof Cederlund, who has been active in the various ''Vasa''-projects, has described the phenomenon as ''regalskepps-syndromet'', \"the royal ship syndrome\" (after the term used in the 17th century for the largest warships in the Swedish navy). He associates the \"syndrome\" to a nationalist aspect of the [[history of ideas]] and traditional perceptions about hero-kings and glory through war. The focus of this historical theory lies on the \"great periods\" in \"our [Swedish] history\" and shares many similarities with the nationalist views of the [[Viking era]] in the Nordic countries and the praising of Greek and Roman [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] in the Western world in general.<ref>Cederlund (1997), s. 38\u201340</ref> Cederlund has stressed the ritualised aspects of the widely publicised salvage in 1961 and has compared the modern Vasa Museum with \"a temple in the Classical sense of the word\". The placement of the museum on Djurg\u00e5rden, traditional crown property, and its focus on \"the King's ship\" has led him to suggest a description of it as \"The Temple of the Royal Ship\".<ref>Cederlund (1997), s. 15; original quotes: \"''ett tempel i klassisk bem\u00e4rkelse''\"; \"''Det Kungliga Skeppets Tempel''\".</ref>\n\n=== Literature and popular culture ===\n[[Image:Vasa merchandise.jpg|thumb|Merchandise and books based on ''Vasa'' on sale at the Vasa Museum gift shop.]]\n''Vasa's'' unique status has drawn considerable attention and captured the imagination of more than two generations of scholars, tourists, model builders, and authors. Though historically unfounded, the popular perception of the building of the ship as a botched and disorganised affair (dubbed \"the [[Vasa syndrome|''Vasa''-syndrome]]\") has been used by many authors of management literature as an educational example of how not to organise a successful business.<ref>For example this article from [[IEEE]] computing: Richard E. Fairley, Mary Jane Willshire, \"Why the Vasa Sank: 10 Problems and Some Antidotes for Software Projects,\" ''[[IEEE Software]]'' vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 18\u201325, March/April 2003; see also Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 58.</ref> In ''The Tender Ship'', [[Manhattan Project]] engineer [[Arthur Squires]] used the ''Vasa'' story as an opening illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tender Ship: Governmental Management of Technological Change|last=Squires|first=Arthur M.|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=1986|location=Boston|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tendership00arth/page/1 1\u20133]|isbn=081763312X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tendership00arth/page/1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vasa on Lake Ashi.jpg|thumb|The Japanese sightseeing ship on [[Lake Ashi]] inspired by ''Vasa''.]]\nThe Vasa Museum has co-sponsored two versions of a documentary about the history and recovery of the ship, both by documentary filmmaker [[Anders Wahlgren]]. The second version is currently shown in the museum and has been released on VHS and DVD with narration in 16 languages. In late 2011, a third ''Vasa''-film premiered on Swedish television, with a longer running time and a considerably larger budget (with over 7.5&nbsp;million kronor provided by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]).<ref>Hellekant, Johan, \"[http://www.svd.se/kultur/historisk-film-kampar-i-motvind_6309568.svd Historisk film k\u00e4mpar i motvind]\" ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 10 July 2011; Linder, Lars, \"[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/filmrecensioner/vasa-1628 Vasa 1628]\" ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', 27 December 2011.</ref> An educational computer game, now in its second generation, has been made and is used in the museum and on its website to explain the fundamentals of 17th century ship construction and stability. Several mass-produced model kits and countless custom-built models of the ship have been made. In 1991, a 308-tonne [[pastiche]] reproduction of the ship was built in Tokyo to serve as a 650-passenger sightseeing ship. ''Vasa'' has inspired many works of art, including a gilded Disney-themed parody of the [[pilaster]] sculptures on the ship's quarter galleries.<ref>''Modellen: Vasamodeller fr\u00e5n n\u00e4r och fj\u00e4rran''.</ref> Being a popular tourist attraction, ''Vasa'' is used as a motif for various souvenir products such as T-shirts, mugs, refrigerator magnets, and posters.

She was constructed at the navy yard in Stockholm under a contract with private entrepreneurs in 1626\u20131627 and armed primarily with bronze cannons cast in Stockholm specifically for the ship. Richly decorated as a symbol of the king's ambitions for Sweden and himself, upon completion she was one of the most powerfully armed vessels in the world. However, ''Vasa'' was dangerously unstable, with too much weight in the upper structure of the hull. Despite this lack of stability, she was ordered to sea and foundered only a few minutes after encountering a wind stronger than a breeze.\n\nThe order to sail was the result of a combination of factors. The king, who was leading the army in Poland at the time of her maiden voyage, was impatient to see her take up her station as [[flagship]] of the reserve squadron at [[\u00c4lvsnabben]] in the Stockholm Archipelago. At the same time the king's subordinates lacked the political courage to openly discuss the ship's problems or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organised by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish Privy Council]] to find those responsible for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished.\n\nDuring the 1961 recovery, thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around ''Vasa'''s hull by [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeologists]]. Among the many items found were clothing, weapons, cannons, tools, coins, cutlery, food, drink and six of the ten sails. The artifacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques and everyday life in early 17th-century Sweden.\n\n[[File:Vasa D81 2634 (45754508634).jpg|thumb|304px|Vasa's upper transom in Vasa Museum 2018]]\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|A map of Sweden's territorial gains and losses 1560\u20131815. In the years that ''Vasa'' was built and sank, Sweden still had not seized the southernmost of its present provinces, but possessed almost all of modern-day [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]] as well as [[Ingria]] and [[Karelia]].]]\n\nDuring the 17th century, Sweden went from being a sparsely populated, poor, and peripheral northern European kingdom of little influence to one of the [[Great power|major powers]] in continental politics. Between 1611 and 1718 it was the dominant power in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], eventually gaining territory that encompassed the Baltic on all sides. This rise to prominence in international affairs and increase in military prowess, called ''[[Swedish Empire|stormaktstiden]]'' (\"age of greatness\" or \"great power period\"), was made possible by a succession of able monarchs and the establishment of a powerful centralised government, supporting a highly efficient military organization. Swedish historians have described this as one of the more extreme examples of an early modern state using almost all of its available resources to wage war; the small northern kingdom transformed itself into a [[fiscal-military state]] and one of the most militarised states in history.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 36\u201339; see also Jan Glete's paper ''[http://www2.historia.su.se/personal/jan_glete/Glete-Swedish_Fiscal-military_State.pdf The Swedish fiscal-military state and its navy, 1521\u20131721]''.</ref>\n\n[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] (1594\u20131632) has been considered one of the most successful Swedish kings in terms of success in warfare. When ''Vasa'' was built, he had been in power for more than a decade. Sweden was embroiled in a [[Polish-Swedish War (1625\u20131629)|war with Poland-Lithuania]], and looked apprehensively at the development of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in present-day Germany. The war had been raging since 1618 and from a [[Protestant]] perspective it was not successful. The king's plans for a Polish campaign and for securing Sweden's interests required a strong naval presence in the Baltic.<ref name=\"roberts\">Roberts (1953\u201358)</ref>\n\nThe navy suffered several severe setbacks during the 1620s. In 1625, a squadron cruising in the [[Bay of Riga]] was caught in a storm and ten ships ran aground and were wrecked. In the [[Battle of Oliwa]] in 1627, a Swedish squadron was outmaneuvered and defeated by a Polish force and two large ships were lost. ''Tigern'' (\"The Tiger\"), which was the Swedish admiral's flagship, was captured by the Poles, and ''Solen'' (\"The Sun\") was blown up by her own crew when it was boarded and nearly captured. In 1628, three more large ships were lost in less than a month; Admiral [[Clas Fleming (admiral)|Klas Fleming]]'s flagship ''Kristina'' was wrecked in a storm in the [[Gulf of Danzig]], ''Riksnyckeln'' (\"Key of the Realm\") ran aground at Viksten in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and ''Vasa'' foundered on her maiden voyage. Gustavus Adolphus was engaged in naval warfare on several fronts, which further exacerbated the difficulties of the navy. In addition to battling the Polish navy, the Swedes were indirectly threatened by Imperial forces that had invaded [[Jutland]]. The Swedish king had little sympathy for the Danish king, [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], and Denmark and Sweden had been bitter enemies for well over a century. However, Sweden feared a Catholic conquest of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. This would have granted the Catholic powers control over the strategic passages between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]], which would be disastrous for Swedish interests.<ref name=\"roberts\" /><ref name=\"Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47\">Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 47.</ref>\n\nUntil the early 17th century, the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium-sized ships with a single gundeck, normally armed with 12-pounder and smaller cannons; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well-suited for escort and patrol. They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy, which emphasised boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery. The king, who was a keen artillerist, saw the potential of ships as gun platforms, and large, heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power. Beginning with ''Vasa'', he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks, outfitted with much heavier guns.<ref>Hocker (2011), p. 147</ref> Five such ships were built after ''Vasa'' (''\u00c4pplet'', ''Kronan'', ''Scepter'' and ''G\u00f6ta Ark'') before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king's death in 1632. These ships, especially ''Kronan'' and ''Scepter'', were much more successful and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s. The second of the so-called ''regalskepp'' (usually translated as \"royal ships\"),<ref>''Vasa'' was actually never referred to as a ''regalskepp'' before it was lost, but was classified as one afterwards; Hocker (2011), pp. 147\u201348.</ref> ''\u00c4pplet'' (\"The Apple\"; the Swedish term for the [[globus cruciger]]), was built simultaneously with ''Vasa''. The only significant difference between the design of ''Vasa'' and her sister ship was an increase in width of about a metre (3.1&nbsp;ft).<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 39; for more on ''\u00c4pplet'', see {{in lang|sv}} Jan Glete, \"[https://www.webcitation.org/5hFXgHHMe?url=http://www.marinarkeologi.net/pdf/mt4-2002_16-21.pdf Gustav II Adolfs \u00c4pplet]\" in ''Marinarkeologisk tidskrift'' nr 4, 2002.</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n[[Image:Vasa Top Deck.jpg|thumb|left|''Vasa's'' [[Port (nautical)|port]] side]]\n\nJust before ''Vasa'' was ordered, Dutch-born [[Henrik Hybertsson]] (\"Master Henrik\") was shipwright at the Stockholm shipyard. On 16 January 1625, Master Henrik and business partner Arendt de Groote signed a contract to build four ships, two with a [[keel]] of around {{convert|135|ft|m}} and two smaller ones of {{convert|108|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"sa\">Sandstr\u00f6m (1982)</ref>\n\nMaster Henrik and Arendt de Groote began buying the raw materials needed for the first ships in 1625, purchasing timber from individual estates in Sweden as well as buying rough-sawn planking in [[Riga]], K\u00f6nigsberg (modern [[Kaliningrad]]), and [[Amsterdam]]. As they prepared to begin the first of the new ships in the autumn of 1625, Henrik corresponded with the king through Vice Admiral Klas Fleming about which ship to build first. The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga led the king to propose building two ships of a new, medium size as a quick compromise, and he sent a specification for this, a ship which would be 120 feet (35.6 m) long on the keel. Henrik declined, since he had already cut the timber for a large and a small ship. He laid the keel for a larger ship in late February or early March 1626.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 43\u201344.</ref> Master Henrik never saw Vasa completed; he fell ill in late 1625, and by the summer of 1626 he had handed over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright, Henrik \"Hein\" Jacobsson. He died in the spring of 1627, probably about the same time as the ship was launched.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 41.</ref>\n\nAfter launching, work continued on finishing the upper deck, the sterncastle, the [[beakhead]] and the rigging. Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry, and material had to be ordered from abroad. In the contract for the maintenance of rigging, French sailcloth was specified, but the cloth for the sails of ''Vasa'' most likely came from Holland.<ref>Hocker (2011), p. 94.</ref> The sails were made mostly of [[hemp]] and partly of [[flax]]. The rigging was made entirely of hemp imported from [[Latvia]] through Riga. The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47\u201350.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vasas hull profile.jpg|thumb|upright|A model showing a cross section of ''Vasa''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hull, illustrating the shallow [[hold (ship)|hold]] and two [[gun deck]]s]]\n\nIn the summer of 1628, the captain responsible for supervising construction of the ship, S\u00f6fring Hansson, arranged for the ship's stability to be demonstrated for Vice Admiral Fleming, who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia. Thirty men ran back and forth across the upper deck to start the ship rolling, but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips, as he feared the ship would capsize. According to testimony by the ship's master, G\u00f6ran Mattson, Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home. Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship put to sea as soon as possible.<ref name=\"Vasa\">Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 53.</ref>\n\nThere has been much speculation about whether ''Vasa'' was lengthened during construction and whether an additional gun deck was added late during the build. Little evidence suggests that ''Vasa'' was substantially modified after the keel was laid. Ships contemporary to ''Vasa'' that were elongated were cut in half and new timbers spliced between the existing sections, making the addition readily identifiable, but no such addition can be identified in the hull, nor is there any evidence for any late additions of a second gundeck. The king ordered 72 24-pound guns for the ship on 5 August 1626, and this was too many to fit on a single gun deck. Since the king's order was issued less than five months after construction started, it would have come early enough for the second deck to be included in the design. The French ''Galion du Guise'', the ship used as a model for ''Vasa'', according to Arendt de Groote, also had two gun decks.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 45\u201346.</ref> [[3D scanner|Laser measurements]] of ''Vasa's'' structure conducted in 2007\u20132011 confirmed that no major changes were implemented during construction, but that the centre of gravity was too high.<ref>Hocker (2011), pp. 39\u201341.</ref>\n\n''Vasa'' was an early example of a warship with two full gun decks, and was built when the theoretical principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood. There is no evidence that Henrik Hybertsson had ever built a ship like it before, and two gundecks is a much more complicated compromise between seaworthiness and firepower than a single gundeck. Safety margins at the time were also far below anything that would be acceptable today. Combined with the fact that 17th-century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures (to be used as firing platforms), this made ''Vasa'' a risky undertaking.<ref>Fred Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:Vasa-lower gun deck-2.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of the lower gun deck looking toward the bow]]\n\n''Vasa'' was built during a time of transition in naval tactics, from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organised [[ship-of-the-line]] and a focus on victory through superior gunnery. ''Vasa'' was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern, which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers it was supposed to carry, but the high-sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimised for boarding. It was neither the largest ship ever built, nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns. What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannon of one side: 588 pounds (267&nbsp;kg), excluding ''stormstycken'', guns used for firing anti-personnel ammunition instead of solid shot. This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time, perhaps in all of northern Europe, and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built. This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried. By comparison, ''[[USS Constitution]]'', a frigate built by the United States 169 years after ''Vasa'', had roughly the same firepower, but was over 700&nbsp;[[tonnes]] heavier.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 49.</ref>\n\nThe ''Constitution'', however, belonged to a later era of naval warfare that employed the [[line of battle]]-tactic, where ships fought in single file (or ''line ahead'') while the group as a whole attempted to present the batteries of one side toward the enemy. The guns would be aimed in the same direction and fire could be concentrated on a single target. In the 17th century, tactics involving organised formations of large fleets had still not been developed. Rather, ships would fight individually or in small improvised groups, and focused on boarding. ''Vasa'', though possessing a formidable battery, was built with these tactics in mind, and therefore lacked a unified [[broadside]] with guns that were all aimed in roughly the same direction. Rather, the guns were intended to be fired independently and were arranged according to the curvature of the hull, meaning that the ship would be bristled with artillery in all directions, covering virtually all angles.<ref>The guns facing fight aft, the ''stern chasers'', were still not on board when the ship sank, however; Hocker (2011) pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\nNaval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy. Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship. Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of, while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years. In Sweden and many other European countries, a ship would normally not \"own\" its guns, but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season. Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size. What allowed ''Vasa'' to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship, but also that the 46 main 24-pounder guns were of a new and standardised lightweight design, cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm, under the direction of the Swiss-born founder Medardus Gessus. Two additional 24-pounders, of a heavier and older design, were mounted in the bows, the so-called ''[[Chase gun|bow chasers]]''. Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern, but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships, and ''Vasa'' waited nearly a year after construction was finished for its armament. When the ship sailed in August 1628, eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered. All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused, but ''Vasa's'' guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimetres, and their bores were almost exactly 146&nbsp;mm (5.7&nbsp;in). The remaining armament of ''Vasa'' consisted of eight 3-pounders, six large caliber ''stormstycken'' (similar to what the English called [[howitzer]]s) for use during boarding actions, and two 1-pound [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]]. Also included on board were 894 kilograms (1,970&nbsp;lb) of [[gunpowder]] and over 1,000 shot of various types for the guns.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47\u201351.</ref>\n\n=== Ornamentation ===\n[[Image:Vasa stern color model.jpg|thumb|A 1:10 scale model of the ship on display at the [[Vasa Museum]]. The sculptures are painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]\nAs was the custom with warships at the time, parts of ''Vasa'' were decorated with sculptures.\nResidues of paint have been found on many sculptures and on other parts of the ship. The entire ornamentation was once painted in vivid colors. The sides of the [[beakhead]] (the protruding structure below the [[bowsprit]]), the bulwarks (the protective railing around the weather deck), the roofs of the [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], and the background of the [[Transom (nautical)|transom]] (the flat surface at the stern of the ship) were all painted red, while the sculptures were decorated in bright colors, and the dazzling effect of these was in some places emphasised with [[gold leaf]]. Previously, it was believed that the background color had been blue and that all sculptures had been almost entirely gilded, and this is reflected in many paintings of ''Vasa'' from the 1970s to the early 1990s, such as the lively and dramatic drawings of [[Bj\u00f6rn Landstr\u00f6m]] or the painting by Francis Smitheman.<ref>See sample from Smitheman's website here [http://www.smitheman.com/004-full.html].</ref> In the late 1990s, this view was revised and the colors are properly reflected in more recent reproductions of the ship's decoration by maritime painter [[Tim Thompson (artist)|Tim Thompson]] and the 1:10 scale model in the museum. ''Vasa'' is an example not so much of the heavily gilded sculptures of early [[Baroque]] art but rather \"the last gasps of the [[medieval art|medieval]] sculpture tradition\" with its fondness for gaudy colors, in a style that today would be considered extravagant or even vulgar.<ref name=\"Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47\"/>\n\n[[File:Vasaskultpurrepliker.jpg|thumb|left|Modern replicas in the [[Vasa Museum]] of some of the ship's sculptures that have been painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]\nThe sculptures are carved out of [[oak]], [[pine]] or [[Tilia|linden]], and many of the larger pieces, like the huge 3-metre (10&nbsp;ft) long figurehead lion, consist of several parts carved individually and fitted together with bolts. Close to 500 sculptures, most of which are concentrated on the high stern and its galleries and on the beakhead, are found on the ship.<ref>Soop (1986), pp. 20\u201321.</ref> The figure of [[Hercules]] appears as a pair of pendants, one younger and one older, on each side of the lower stern galleries; the pendants depict opposite aspects of the ancient hero, who was extremely popular during antiquity as well as in 17th-century European art. On the transom are biblical and nationalistic symbols and images. A particularly popular motif is the lion, which can be found as the [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascarons]] originally fitted on the insides of the gunport doors, grasping the royal coat of arms on either side, the figurehead, and even clinging to the top of the rudder. Each side of the beakhead originally had 20 figures (though only 19 have actually been found) that depicted [[Roman emperor]]s from [[Tiberius]] to [[Septimius Severus]]. Overall, almost all heroic and positive imagery is directly or indirectly identified with the king and was originally intended to glorify him as a wise and powerful ruler. The only actual portrait of the king, however, is located at the very top of the transom in the stern. Here he is depicted as a young boy with long, flowing hair, being crowned by two [[griffin]]s representing the king's father, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]].<ref>Before being crowned as king, Charles had been duke of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], whose coat of arms include a griffin [[segreant]], standing with its front legs raised; Soop (1986), pp. 18\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Vasa color pigments.jpg|thumb|A recreation of the color pigments that were used by the naval shipyard where the ship was built; exhibit at the [[Vasa Museum]].]]\nA team of at least six expert sculptors worked for a minimum of two years on the sculptures, most likely with the assistance of an unknown number of apprentices and assistants. No direct credit for any of the sculptures has been provided, but the distinct style of one of the most senior artists, M\u00e5rten Redtmer, is clearly identifiable. Other accomplished artists, like Hans Clausink, Johan Didrichson Tijsen (or ''Thessen'' in Swedish) and possibly Marcus Ledens, are known to have been employed for extensive work at the naval yards at the time ''Vasa'' was built, but their respective styles are not distinct enough to associate them directly with any specific sculptures.<ref>Soop (1986), pp. 241\u2013253.</ref>\n\nThe artistic quality of the sculptures varies considerably, and about four distinct styles can be identified. The only artist who has been positively associated with various sculptures is M\u00e5rten Redtmer, whose style has been described as \"powerful, lively and naturalistic\".<ref>Soop (1986), p. 247.</ref> He was responsible for a considerable number of the sculptures. These include some of the most important and prestigious pieces: the figurehead lion, the royal coat of arms, and the sculpture of the king at the top of the transom. Two of the other styles are described as \"elegant ... a little stereotyped and manneristic\", and of a \"heavy, leisurely but nevertheless rich and lively style\", respectively. The fourth and last style, deemed clearly inferior to the other three, is described as \"stiff and ungainly\"<ref>Quotes from Soop (1986), p. 252.</ref> and was done by other carvers, perhaps even apprentices, of lesser skill.<ref>Soop, pp. 241\u2013253</ref>\n\n== Maiden voyage ==\n[[Image:Voyage of the Vasa 2.svg|thumb|Central [[Stockholm]] and the movements of ''Vasa'' from Skeppsg\u00e5rden ('navy yard') to the anchoring place near the old royal castle where it was fitted and armed in the spring of 1628, and finally the location where it foundered and sank.]]\n\nOn 10 August 1628, Captain S\u00f6fring Hansson ordered ''Vasa'' to depart on her maiden voyage to the naval station at [[\u00c4lvsnabben]]. The day was calm, and the only wind was a light breeze from the southwest. The ship was [[Warping (sailing)|warped]] (hauled by anchor) along the eastern waterfront of the city to the southern side of the harbor, where four sails were set, and the ship made way to the east. The gun ports were open, and the guns were out to fire a salute as the ship left Stockholm.<ref name=\"Vasa\"/>\n\nAs ''Vasa'' passed under the [[Lee side|lee]] of the bluffs to the south (what is now [[S\u00f6dermalm]]), a gust of wind filled her sails, and she [[Heel (sailing)|heeled]] suddenly to [[Port (nautical)|port]]. The [[Sheet (sailing)|sheets]] were cast off, and the ship slowly [[Metacentric height|righted herself]] as the gust passed. At Tegelviken, where there is a gap in the bluffs, an even stronger gust again forced the ship onto its port side, this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface, allowing water to rush in onto the lower gundeck. The water building up on the deck quickly exceeded the ship's minimal ability to right itself, and water continued to pour in until it ran down into the hold; the ship quickly sank to a depth of 32&nbsp;m (105&nbsp;ft) only 120&nbsp;m (390&nbsp;ft) from shore. Survivors clung to debris or the upper masts, which were still above the surface, to save themselves, and many nearby boats rushed to their aid, but despite these efforts and the short distance to land, 30 people perished with the ship, according to reports. ''Vasa'' sank in full view of a crowd of hundreds, if not thousands, of mostly ordinary Stockholmers who had come to see the great ship set sail. The crowd included foreign ambassadors, in effect spies of Gustavus Adolphus' allies and enemies, who also witnessed the catastrophe.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\n=== Inquest ===\nThe Council sent a letter to the king the day after the loss, telling him of the sinking, but it took over two weeks to reach him in Poland. \"Imprudence and negligence\" must have been the cause, he wrote angrily in his reply, demanding in no uncertain terms that the guilty parties be punished.<ref name=\"kv2535\"/> Captain S\u00f6fring Hansson, who survived the disaster, was immediately taken for questioning. Under initial interrogation, he swore that the guns had been properly secured and that the crew was sober. A full inquest before a tribunal of members of the Privy Council and Admiralty took place at the [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Royal Palace]] on 5 September 1628. Each of the surviving officers was questioned as was the supervising shipwright and a number of expert witnesses. Also present at the inquest was the Admiral of the Realm, [[Carl Gyllenhielm|Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm]]. The object of the inquest was as much or more to find a scapegoat as to find out why the ship had sunk. Whoever the committee might find guilty for the fiasco would face a severe penalty.<ref name=\"kv2535\">Kvarning (1998), pp. 25\u201335.</ref>\n\nSurviving crew members were questioned one by one about the handling of the ship at the time of the disaster. Was it rigged properly for the wind? Was the crew sober? Was the ballast properly stowed? Were the guns properly secured? However, no-one was prepared to take the blame. Crewmen and contractors formed two camps; each tried to blame the other, and everyone swore he had done his duty without fault and it was during the inquest that the details of the stability demonstration were revealed.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 29\u201335; Hocker in Cederlund (2006); pp. 55\u201360.</ref>\n\nNext, attention was directed to the shipbuilders. \"Why did you build the ship so narrow, so badly and without enough bottom that it capsized?\" the prosecutor asked the shipwright Jacobsson.<ref name=\"Vasa_2\">Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 36.</ref> Jacobsson stated that he built the ship as directed by Henrik Hybertsson (long since dead and buried), who in turn had followed the specification approved by the king. Jacobsson had in fact widened the ship by 1 foot 5 inches (c. 42&nbsp;cm) after taking over responsibility for the construction, but construction of the ship was too far advanced to allow further widening.<ref name=\"Vasa_2\"/>\n\nIn the end, no guilty party could be found. The answer Arendt de Groote gave when asked by the court why the ship sank was \"Only God knows\". Gustavus Adolphus had approved all measurements and armaments, and the ship was built according to the instructions and loaded with the number of guns specified. In the end, no-one was punished or found guilty for negligence, and the blame effectively fell on Henrik Hybertsson.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 25\u201332.</ref>\n\n== ''Vasa'' as a wreck ==\n[[Image:17th century salvaging.jpg|thumb|Illustration from a treatise on salvaging from 1734, showing the traditional method of raising a wreck with the help of [[anchor]]s and ships or [[hulk (ship)|hulks]] as [[Float (nautical)|pontoons]], basically the same method that was used to raise ''Vasa'' in the 20th century.]]\n\nLess than three days after the disaster, a contract was signed for the ship to be raised. However, those efforts were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Hafstr\u00f6m in Vasa I, p. 69\">Hafstr\u00f6m in Cederlund (2006), p. 69.</ref> The earliest attempts at raising ''Vasa'' by English engineer Ian Bulmer,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QhVhBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT54|title=Shipwreck: A History of Disasters at Sea|last=Willis|first=Sam|year=2013|publisher=Quercus|isbn=978-1-78206-522-7|location=|pages=54|language=en}}</ref> resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery.<ref name=\"Hafstr\u00f6m in Vasa I, p. 69\"/> Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today, but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise ''Vasa'' more than 300 years later. Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck, and ropes attached to several [[anchor]]s were sent down and hooked to the ship. The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe, the ropes tightened, and the water pumped out. The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters. The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level. Even if the underwater weight of ''Vasa'' was not great, the mud in which it had settled made it sit more securely on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome.<ref>Hafstr\u00f6m in Cederlund (2006), pp. 98\u2013104.</ref> More than 30 years after the ship's sinking, in 1663\u20131665, Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns. With a simple [[diving bell]], the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them.<ref>Hafstr\u00f6m in Cederlund (2006), pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nSuch activity waned when it became clear that the ship could not be raised by the technology of the time. However, ''Vasa'' did not fall completely into obscurity after the recovery of the guns. The ship was mentioned in several histories of Sweden and the Swedish Navy, and the location of the wreck appeared on harbor charts of Stockholm in the 19th century. In 1844, the navy officer Anton Ludwig Fahnehjelm turned in a request for salvaging rights to the ship, claiming he had located it. Fahnehjelm was an inventor who designed an early form of light diving suit and had previously been involved in other salvage operations. There were dives made on the wreck in 1895\u20131896, and a commercial salvage company applied for a permit to raise or salvage the wreck in 1920, but this was turned down. In 1999, a witness also claimed that his father, a petty officer in the Swedish navy, had taken part in diving exercises on ''Vasa'' in the years before World War I.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 142\u2013143.</ref>\n\n=== Deterioration ===\n[[File:Vasa-knightheads.jpg|thumb|left|Two of the knightheads, posts used to fasten ropes, on the weather deck. The details of carved heads have been eroded almost beyond recognition by the currents of [[Stockholms str\u00f6m]].]]\nIn the 333 years that ''Vasa'' lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor (called [[Stockholms str\u00f6m]], \"the Stream\", in Swedish), the ship and its contents were subject to several destructive forces, first among which were decomposition and erosion. Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the [[beakhead]] and much of the sterncastle together, and this included all of the ship's wooden sculptures. Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking, and only large objects, such as anchors, or items made of cast iron, such as cannonballs, survived. Organic materials fared better in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions, and so wood, cloth and leather are often in very good condition, but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water, so that some are barely recognizable.<ref name=\"Hocker pp. 153\">Hocker & Wendel in Cederlund (2006), pp. 153\u2013170.</ref> Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected, so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding. Of the human remains, most of the soft tissue was quickly consumed by bacteria, fish and crustaceans, leaving only the bones, which were often held together only by clothing, although in one case, hair, nails and brain tissue survived.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 146\u2013152.</ref>\n\nThe parts of the hull held together by joinery and wooden treenails remained intact for as much as two centuries, suffering gradual erosion of surfaces exposed to the water, unless they were disturbed by outside forces.\nEventually the entire sterncastle, the high, aft portion of the ship that housed the officers' quarters and held up the transom, gradually collapsed into the mud with all the decorative sculptures. The [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], which were merely nailed to the sides of the sterncastle, collapsed fairly quickly and were found lying almost directly below their original locations.<ref name=\"Hocker pp. 153\"/>\n\nHuman activity was the most destructive factor, as the initial salvage efforts, the recovery of the guns, and the final salvage in the 20th century all left their marks. Peckell and Treileben broke up and removed much of the planking of the weather deck to get to the cannons on the decks below. Peckell reported that he had recovered 30 cartloads of wood from the ship; these might have included not just planking and structural details but also some of the sculptures which today are missing, such as the life-size Roman warrior near the bow and the sculpture of [[Septimius Severus]] that adorned the port side of the [[beakhead]].<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 154.</ref> Since ''Vasa'' lay in a busy shipping channel, ships occasionally dropped anchor over the ship, and one large anchor demolished most of the upper sterncastle, probably in the 19th century. Construction work in Stockholm harbor usually results in blasting of bedrock, and the resulting tonnes of rubble were often dumped in the harbor; some of this landed on the ship, causing further damage to the stern and the upper deck.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 151\u2013152.</ref>\n\n=== ''Vasa'' rediscovered ===\nIn the early 1950s, amateur [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Anders Franz\u00e9n]] considered the possibility of recovering wrecks from the cold [[brackish]] waters of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] because, he reasoned, they were free from the [[shipworm]] ''Teredo navalis'', which usually destroys submerged wood rapidly in warmer, saltier seas. Franz\u00e9n had previously been successful in locating wrecks such as ''Riks\u00e4pplet'' and ''Lybska Svan'', and after long and tedious research he began looking for ''Vasa'' as well. He spent many years probing the waters without success around the many assumed locations of the wreckage. He did not succeed until, based on accounts of an unknown topographical anomaly just south of the Gustav V dock on [[Beckholmen]], he narrowed his search. In 1956, with a home-made, gravity-powered coring probe, he located a large wooden object almost parallel to the mouth of dock on Beckholmen. The location of the ship received considerable attention, even if the identification of the ship could not be determined without closer investigation. Soon after the announcement of the find, planning got underway to determine how to excavate and raise ''Vasa''. The [[Swedish Navy]] was involved from the start, as were various museums and the National Heritage board, representatives of which eventually formed the ''Vasa'' Committee, the predecessor of the ''Vasa'' Board.<ref>''Vasa I'', Cederlund and Hocker, pp. 172\u2013180</ref>\n[[Image:Zetterstr\u00f6m nozzle1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Zetterstr\u00f6m nozzle]], designed to expel equal amounts of water both forwards and backwards for recoilless operation under water.]]\n\n=== Recovery ===\n[[File:Vasa 14 maj 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Hulk of ''Vasa'' after recovery operations, May 14, 1961]]\nA number of possible recovery methods were proposed, including filling the ship with ping-pong balls and freezing it in a block of ice, but the method chosen by the Vasa Board (which succeeded the Vasa Committee) was essentially the same one attempted immediately after the sinking. Divers spent two years digging six tunnels under the ship for steel cable slings, which were taken to a pair of lifting [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] at the surface. The work under the ship was extremely dangerous, requiring the divers to cut tunnels through the clay with high-pressure water jets and suck up the resulting slurry with a dredge, all while working in total darkness with hundreds of tonnes of mud-filled ship overhead.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 234\u2013244.</ref> A persisting risk was that the wreck could shift or settle deeper into the mud while a diver was working in a tunnel, trapping him underneath the wreckage. The almost vertical sections of the tunnels near the side of the hull could also potentially collapse and bury a diver inside.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 252.</ref> Despite the dangerous conditions, more than 1,300 dives were made in the [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operation without any serious accidents.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 61\u201369.</ref>\n\nEach time the pontoons were pumped full, the cables tightened and the pontoons were pumped out, the ship was brought a metre closer to the surface. In a series of 18 lifts in August and September 1959, the ship was moved from depth of 32 metres (105&nbsp;ft) to 16 metres (52&nbsp;ft) in the more sheltered area of Kastellholmsviken, where divers could work more safely to prepare for the final lift.<ref>Kvarning (1998), p. 69.</ref> Over the course of a year and a half, a small team of commercial divers cleared debris and mud from the upper decks to lighten the ship, and made the hull as watertight as possible. The gun ports were closed by means of temporary lids, a temporary replacement of the collapsed sterncastle was constructed, and many of the holes from the iron bolts that had rusted away were plugged. The final lift began on 8 April 1961, and on the morning of 24 April, ''Vasa'' was ready to return to the world for the first time in 333 years. Press from all over the world, television cameras, 400 invited guests on barges and boats, and thousands of spectators on shore watched as the first timbers broke the surface. The ship was then emptied of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V [[dry dock]] on Beckholmen, where the ship was floated on its own keel onto a concrete pontoon, on which the hull still stands.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 285\u2013290.</ref>\n\nFrom the end of 1961 to December 1988, ''Vasa'' was housed in a temporary facility called Wasavarvet (\"The Vasa Shipyard\"), which included exhibit space as well as the activities centred on the ship. A building was erected over the ship on its pontoon, but it was very cramped, making conservation work awkward. Visitors could view the ship from just two levels, and the maximum viewing distance was in most places only a couple of metres, which made it difficult for viewers to get an overall view of the ship. In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent building was to be constructed, and a design competition was organised. The winning design, by the Swedish architects M\u00e5nsson and Dahlb\u00e4ck, called for a large hall over the ship in a polygonal, industrial style. Ground was broken in 1987, and ''Vasa'' was towed into the half-finished [[Vasa Museum]] in December 1988. The museum was officially opened to the public in 1990.<ref>Kvarning (1998), pp. 163\u2013173.</ref>\n\n== Archaeology ==\n''Vasa'' posed an unprecedented challenge for archaeologists. Never before had a four-story structure, with most of its original contents largely undisturbed, been available for excavation.<ref>Cederlund & Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 298.</ref> The conditions under which the team had to work added to the difficulties. The ship had to be kept wet in order that it not dry out and crack before it could be properly conserved. Digging had to be performed under a constant drizzle of water and in a sludge-covered mud that could be more than one metre (approximately three feet) deep. In order to establish find locations, the hull was divided into several sections demarcated by the many structural beams, the decking and by a line drawn along the centre of the ship from stern to bow. For the most part, the decks were excavated individually, though at times work progressed on more than one deck level simultaneously.<ref>Cederlund & Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 300.</ref>\n\n=== Finds ===\n[[File:Br\u00e4dspel - Vasamuseet - 25364.jpg|thumb|A [[Backgammon]] set found on ''Vasa'', complete with [[dice]] and markers]]\n''Vasa'' had four preserved decks: the upper and lower gun decks, the hold and the [[Orlop deck|orlop]]. Because of the constraints of preparing the ship for conservation, the archaeologists had to work quickly, in 13-hour shifts during the first week of excavation. The upper gun deck was greatly disturbed by the various salvage projects between 1628 and 1961, and it contained not only material that had fallen down from the rigging and upper deck, but also more than three centuries of harbor refuse.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 315.</ref> The decks below were progressively less disturbed. The gundecks contained not just gun carriages, the three surviving cannons, and other objects of a military nature, but were also where most of the personal possessions of the sailors had been stored at the time of the sinking. These included a wide range of loose finds, as well as chests and casks with spare clothing and shoes, tools and materials for mending, money (in the form of low-denomination copper coins), privately purchased provisions, and all of the everyday objects needed for life at sea. Most of the finds are of wood, testifying not only to the simple life on board, but to the generally unsophisticated state of Swedish material culture in the early 17th century. The lower decks were primarily used for storage, and so the hold was filled with barrels of provisions and gunpowder, coils of anchor cable, iron shot for the guns, and the personal possessions of some of the officers. On the orlop deck, a small compartment contained six of the ship's ten sails, rigging spares, and the working parts for the ship's pumps. Another compartment contained the possessions of the ship's carpenter, including a large tool chest.<ref>Cederlund & Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 302\u2013305; for the item catalog, see [http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ this link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016142656/http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ |date=16 October 2007 }}.</ref>\n\nAfter the ship itself had been salvaged and excavated, the site of the loss was excavated thoroughly during 1963\u20131967. This produced many items of rigging tackle as well as structural timbers that had fallen off, particularly from the beakhead and sterncastle. Most of the sculptures that had decorated the exterior of the hull were also found in the mud, along with the ship's anchors and the skeletons of at least four people. The last object to be brought up was the nearly 12-metre-long [[longboat]], called ''esping'' in Swedish, found lying parallel to the ship and believed to have been towed by ''Vasa'' when it sank.<ref>Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 470\u2013472.</ref>\n\nMany of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered, but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell. Among the best known of these was a statue of 20th-century Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]], which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (now known as [[Aalto University]]) the night before the final lift.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Ilta-Sanomat]] |url=http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |date=5 July 1961 |title=Vasan Veijarit |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |archivedate=13 July 2004 |accessdate=8 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Yle]] |date=28 April 2011 |title=Teekkarien kuningasj\u00e4yn\u00e4st\u00e4 puoli vuosisataa |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/teekkarien_kuningasjaynasta_puoli_vuosisataa/5350123 |trans-title=Half a century after the famous hack by the University of Technology students |language=Finnish |accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref> The inspiration for the hack was that Sweden had forbidden Nurmi from competing in the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States]].\n\n== Causes of sinking ==\n[[Image:Vasa Cohen 20006123a hr.jpg|thumb|Former Vasa Museum Director Klas Helmerson (left) explaining aspects of the sinking of the ship to then US Defense Secretary [[William Cohen]] (centre) and Swedish Defense Minister [[Bj\u00f6rn von Sydow]] (right).]]\n''Vasa'' sank because it had very little [[initial stability]], which can be thought of as resistance to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship. The [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]] is too high, and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over, and there is not enough [[righting moment]], force trying to make the ship return to an upright position. The reason that the ship has such a high centre of gravity is not due to the guns. These weighed little over 60 tonnes, or about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship. This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size. The problem is in the hull construction itself. The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, only 1.67 metres (5 feet 5\u00bd inches) tall, and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over-dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry, so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.<ref>Hocker (2011), pp. 132\u2013134.</ref>\n\nThe use of different measuring systems on either side of the vessel caused its mass to be distributed asymmetrically, heavier to port. During construction both [[Swedish feet]] and [[Amsterdam feet]] were in use by different teams. Archaeologists have found four rulers used by the workmen who built the ship. Two were calibrated in Swedish feet, which had 12 inches, while the other two measured Amsterdam feet, which had 11 inches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2012-02-23/new-clues-emerge-centuries-old-swedish-shipwreck|title=New Clues Emerge in Centuries-Old Swedish Shipwreck|work=Public Radio International |date=23 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the mathematical tools for calculating or predicting stability were still more than a century in the future, and 17th-century scientific ideas about how ships behaved in water were deeply flawed, the people associated with building and sailing ships for the Swedish navy were very much aware of the forces at work and their relationships to each other. In the last part of the inquest held after the sinking, a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank. Their discussion and conclusions show very clearly that they knew what had happened, and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains, who said that the ship did not have enough \"belly\" to carry the heavy upperworks.<ref name=\"Hocker (2011) 135-137\">Hocker (2011), pp. 135\u2013137.</ref>\n\nCommon practice of the time dictated that heavy guns were to be placed on the lower gun deck to decrease the weight on the upper gun deck and improve stability. The armament plans were changed many times during the build to either 24-pounders on the lower deck along with lighter 12-pounders on the upper deck or 24-pounders on both decks. The gun ports on the upper deck were the correct size for 12-pounders, but in the end the ship was finished with the heavy 24-pounders on both decks, and this may have contributed to poor stability.<ref>Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 51.</ref>\n\n''Vasa'' might not have sunk on 10 August 1628, if the ship had been sailed with the gunports closed. Ships with multiple tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason, the gunport lids are made with a double lip which is designed to seal well enough to keep out most of the water. Captain S\u00f6fring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water, but by then it was too late. If he had done it before he sailed, ''Vasa'' might not have sunk on that day.<ref name=\"Hocker (2011) 135-137\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\n[[Image:Vasa 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''Vasa'' during the early stages of conservation at the Wasa Shipyard.]]\nAlthough ''Vasa'' was in surprisingly good condition after 333 years at the bottom of the sea, it would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry. The large bulk of ''Vasa'', over 600 cubic metres (21,000 cu ft) of oak timber, constituted an unprecedented conservation problem. After some debate on how to best preserve the ship, conservation was carried out by impregnation with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG), a method that has since become the standard treatment for large, waterlogged wooden objects, such as the 16th-century English ship ''[[Mary Rose]]''. ''Vasa'' was sprayed with PEG for 17 years, followed by a long period of slow drying, which is not yet entirely complete.<ref>Hocker (2011), pp. 192\u2013193.</ref>\n\nThe reason that ''Vasa'' was so well-preserved was not just that the [[shipworm]] that normally devours wooden ships was absent but also that the water of [[Stockholms str\u00f6m]] was heavily polluted until the late 20th century. The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving. This, along with the fact that ''Vasa'' had been newly built and was undamaged when it sank, contributed to her conservation. Unfortunately, the properties of the water also had a negative effect. Chemicals present in the water around ''Vasa'' had penetrated the wood, and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had disappeared. Once the ship was exposed to the air, reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds. In the late 1990s, spots of white and yellow residue were noticed on ''Vasa'' and some of the associated artefacts. These turned out to be [[sulfate]]-containing salts that had formed on the surface of the wood when [[sulfides]] reacted with atmospheric oxygen. The salts on the surface of ''Vasa'' and objects found in and around it are not a threat themselves (even if the discolouring may be distracting), but if they are from inside the wood, they may expand and crack the timber from inside. As of 2002, the amount of sulfuric acid in ''Vasa'''s hull was estimated to be more than 2 tonnes, and more is continually being created. Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another 5,000 kilograms (11,000&nbsp;lb) of acid at a rate of about 100 kilograms (220&nbsp;lb) per year; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely.<ref>Dal & Hall Roth (2002), pp. 38\u201339.</ref>\n\nWhile most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for ''Vasa'''s long-term decay is sulfuric acid, Ulla Westermark, professor of wood technology at [[Lule\u00e5 University of Technology]], has proposed another mechanism with her colleague B\u00f6rje Stenberg. Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]] in an acidic environment can generate [[formic acid]] and eventually liquify the wood. ''Vasa'' was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries, and therefore has a relatively low pH. Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present, and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition.<ref>{{in lang|sv}} [[Gothenburg University]] TV, ''[http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full Vetenskapslandet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430060203/http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full |date=30 April 2009 }}''.

Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible. A current problem is that the old [[oak]] of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength and the cradle that supports the ship does not match up very well with the distribution of weight and stress in the hull. \"The amount of movement in the hull is worrying. If nothing is done, the ship will most likely capsize again\", states Magnus Olofson from the ''Vasa'' Museum. An effort to secure ''Vasa'' for the future is under way, in cooperation with the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] and other institutions around the globe.<ref>{{in lang|sv}} Dahlquist, Hans.

To slow the destruction by acidic compounds, different methods have been tried. Small objects have been sealed in plastic containers filled with an inert atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] gas, for halting further reactions between sulfides and oxygen. The ship itself has been treated with cloth saturated in a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] liquid to neutralise the low pH, but this is only a temporary solution as acid is continuously produced. The original bolts rusted away after the ship sank but were replaced with modern ones that were [[galvanization|galvanised]] and covered with [[epoxy]] resin. Despite this, the newer bolts also started to rust and were releasing iron into the wood, which accelerated the deterioration.<ref>Dal & Hall Roth, pp. 39\u201341; Sandstrom, M., Jalilehvand, F., Persson, I., Gelius, U., Frank, P., Hall Roth, I.

Within the disciplines of history and [[maritime archaeology]] the wrecks of large warships from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries have received particularly widespread attention as perceived symbols of a past greatness of the state of Sweden. Among these wrecks, ''Vasa'' is the single best known example, and has also become recognised internationally, not least through a deliberate use of the ship as a symbol for marketing Sweden abroad. The name ''Vasa'' has in Sweden become synonymous with sunken vessels that are considered to be of great historical importance, and these are usually described, explained and valued in relation to ''Vasa'' itself.<ref>Cederlund (1997), s. 38</ref> The Swedish maritime archaeologist Carl-Olof Cederlund, who has been active in the various ''Vasa''-projects, has described the phenomenon as ''regalskepps-syndromet'', \"the royal ship syndrome\" (after the term used in the 17th century for the largest warships in the Swedish navy). He associates the \"syndrome\" to a nationalist aspect of the [[history of ideas]] and traditional perceptions about hero-kings and glory through war. The focus of this historical theory lies on the \"great periods\" in \"our [Swedish] history\" and shares many similarities with the nationalist views of the [[Viking era]] in the Nordic countries and the praising of Greek and Roman [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] in the Western world in general.<ref>Cederlund (1997), s. 38\u201340</ref> Cederlund has stressed the ritualised aspects of the widely publicised salvage in 1961 and has compared the modern Vasa Museum with \"a temple in the Classical sense of the word\". The placement of the museum on Djurg\u00e5rden, traditional crown property, and its focus on \"the King's ship\" has led him to suggest a description of it as \"The Temple of the Royal Ship\".<ref>Cederlund (1997), s. 15; original quotes: \"''ett tempel i klassisk bem\u00e4rkelse''\"; \"''Det Kungliga Skeppets Tempel''\".</ref>\n\n=== Literature and popular culture ===\n[[Image:Vasa merchandise.jpg|thumb|Merchandise and books based on ''Vasa'' on sale at the Vasa Museum gift shop.]]\n''Vasa's'' unique status has drawn considerable attention and captured the imagination of more than two generations of scholars, tourists, model builders, and authors. Though historically unfounded, the popular perception of the building of the ship as a botched and disorganised affair (dubbed \"the [[Vasa syndrome|''Vasa''-syndrome]]\") has been used by many authors of management literature as an educational example of how not to organise a successful business.<ref>For example this article from [[IEEE]] computing: Richard E. Fairley, Mary Jane Willshire, \"Why the Vasa Sank: 10 Problems and Some Antidotes for Software Projects,\" ''[[IEEE Software]]'' vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 18\u201325, March/April 2003; see also Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 58.</ref> In ''The Tender Ship'', [[Manhattan Project]] engineer [[Arthur Squires]] used the ''Vasa'' story as an opening illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tender Ship: Governmental Management of Technological Change|last=Squires|first=Arthur M.|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=1986|location=Boston|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tendership00arth/page/1 1\u20133]|isbn=081763312X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tendership00arth/page/1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vasa on Lake Ashi.jpg|thumb|The Japanese sightseeing ship on [[Lake Ashi]] inspired by ''Vasa''.]]\nThe Vasa Museum has co-sponsored two versions of a documentary about the history and recovery of the ship, both by documentary filmmaker [[Anders Wahlgren]]. The second version is currently shown in the museum and has been released on VHS and DVD with narration in 16 languages. In late 2011, a third ''Vasa''-film premiered on Swedish television, with a longer running time and a considerably larger budget (with over 7.5&nbsp;million kronor provided by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]).<ref>Hellekant, Johan, \"[http://www.svd.se/kultur/historisk-film-kampar-i-motvind_6309568.svd Historisk film k\u00e4mpar i motvind]\" ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 10 July 2011; Linder, Lars, \"[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/filmrecensioner/vasa-1628 Vasa 1628]\" ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', 27 December 2011.</ref> An educational computer game, now in its second generation, has been made and is used in the museum and on its website to explain the fundamentals of 17th century ship construction and stability. Several mass-produced model kits and countless custom-built models of the ship have been made. In 1991, a 308-tonne [[pastiche]] reproduction of the ship was built in Tokyo to serve as a 650-passenger sightseeing ship. ''Vasa'' has inspired many works of art, including a gilded Disney-themed parody of the [[pilaster]] sculptures on the ship's quarter galleries.<ref>''Modellen: Vasamodeller fr\u00e5n n\u00e4r och fj\u00e4rran''.</ref> Being a popular tourist attraction, ''Vasa'' is used as a motif for various souvenir products such as T-shirts, mugs, refrigerator magnets, and posters. Commercially produced replicas\u2014such as drinking glasses, plates, spoons, and even a [[backgammon]] game\u2014have been made from many of the objects belonging to the crew or officers found on the ship.<ref>[http://www.vasamuseet.se/InEnglish/Visit/museumshop/repliker.aspx Vasa Museum homepage].

It was replaced in 1972 with the Grifo IR-8, which used a small-block [[Ford Boss 351 engine]] (5.8-litre) as its power train. This was the last new Iso of any type, as the manufacturer went bankrupt; it shut down and ceased all operations permanently in 1974.<ref name=buckleyrees/> The bankruptcy had a number of causes, perhaps the largest being the [[1973 oil crisis]], which significantly reduced demand for cars with large V8 engines.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Iso Grifo Rear.JPG|left|thumb|Iso Grifo Series I, rear view]]\n\nIso [[Joint-stock company|S.p.A.]] in [[Bresso]] was already well known for producing the high-performance [[Iso Rivolta IR 300]]; a sleek looking 2+2 Coupe based on a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] power and drive train.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silodrome.com/short-film-iso-rivolta-chronicles/|title=The Iso Rivolta Chronicles Film Series|date=2017-06-06|website=Silodrome}}</ref> After leaving [[Ferrari]], in 1961 [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] set up ''\u201cPrototipi Bizzarrini\u201d'' in [[Livorno]], [[Tuscany]] where he designed and consulted for marques such as ATS, [[Lamborghini]], and Iso.<ref name=Fearnley>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-2003/90/bizza-express|title=Bizza express|magazine=[[Motor Sport Magazine]]|page=90|issue=December 2003|author=Paul Fearnley|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> In 1963, he designed the Iso Grifo A3/L (\"L\" for ''Lusso'', Italian for \"luxury\") for [[Renzo Rivolta]], who was looking for a follow-up to his IR 300.<ref name=Fearnley/> The body was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] at [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]], while Bizzarrini put his expertise in the mechanicals.<ref name=scm201312/>  \n\nBizzarrini figured there would also be a demand for a race version of the Grifo and developed the A3/C (C for Corsa) with a dramatic, modified alloy body.<ref name=Fearnley/> He later dubbed it his \u201cImproved GTO.\" He designed the [[Ferrari 250 GTO|250 GTO]] when he had worked for Ferrari. In the Corsa, he moved the engine back about {{Convert|40|mm|abbr=on}}, making the A3/C a front, mid-engined car. To adjust the timing, mechanics had to remove a piece of the dashboard.<ref name=Fearnley/> Both cars were being built simultaneously. When leaving the factory, both the [[Ferrari 250 GTO|250 GTO]] and Iso Grifo were originally fitted with [[Pirelli Cinturato]] 205VR15 tires (CN72).\n\nAt the [[Turin Motor Show]] that same year, Bertone showed the Grifo A3/L prototype while Iso showed off the unpainted competition version: the Iso Grifo A3/C.<ref name=Frankel>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-2016/84/power-without-glory|title=Power without glory|magazine=[[Motor Sport Magazine]]|page=84|issue=March 2016|author=Andrew Frankel|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> Both became successful in their own right, the road car receiving praise from the press, while the racer performed very well although it had been made on a much tighter budget compared to [[Ferrari]].<ref name=Frankel/> Rivolta also showed a prototype A3/L Spyder at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\n==Grifo GL &ndash; Bizzarrini A3/C split==\nIso concentrated on getting the A3/L ready for production, concentrating on some of the design changes that had to be made to the prototype. The car got a light face-lift that made it less aggressive in appearance. It was given a modified but reliable [[Chevrolet small-block engine#327|Chevrolet small-block 327]] Corvette engine [[V8 engine|V8]] (5.4 L) engine\u2014either in 300 or 350&nbsp;hp\u2014coupled to a [[Borg-Warner]] 4-speed top-loader. The engines were completely ordered and manufactured in the [[United States]]; they were shipped to Italy where they were taken apart and blueprinted before they were eventually installed in the cars. This was similar to the manufacture of the IR 300. With over {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} and a weight of less than {{convert|2200|lb|abbr=on}}, the vehicle was able to reach speeds over {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1964, the prototype A3/C raced at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] (Edgar Berney/Pierre Noblet were drivers), running well until brake problems required a two-hour [[pit stop]].<ref name=Frankel/> The car resumed the race, finally finishing 14th. In 1965, the car performed better, finishing 9th at Le Mans.<ref name=Frankel/>\n\nThe production of the Iso Grifo GL started in 1965, but the Bizzarrini and Rivolta partnership quickly fell apart over the use of the name Grifo. This resulted in separate production of the Grifo GL and the competition Bizzarrini A3/C.<ref name=Frankel/><ref name=LM>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-1995/60/captain-scarlet|title=Captain Scarlet|magazine=[[Motor Sport Magazine]]|page=60|issue=December 1995|author=L M|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> The Grifo GL was produced at Bresso, while the A3/C was produced at Piero Drogo\u2019s Sports Cars of [[Modena]], under Bizzarini's strict supervision. Bizzarrini refined his A3/C , eventually developing his line of [[Bizzarrini Strada|Bizzarrini 5300 Stradas]] and Corsas.<ref name=Frankel/><ref name=LM/> Only 22 examples of the Grifo A3/C were constructed before Rivolta and Bizzarrini split.\n\nIn October 1966, the first Grifo (car #97) with a [[Targa top|targa]] top was shown at the Turin Motor Show. This was one of only thirteen Series I Targas ever built; later, only four series II Targas were built.<ref name=Gulett/>\n\n==Updates==\n[[File:Iso grifo can am.jpg|thumb|Iso Grifo Can Am with the characteristic 7-litre engine \"penthouse\" on the hood and Grifo Series II hide-away headlights]]\nIn 1968 the Grifo 7 Litri was introduced, featuring a Chevrolet L71 big-block engine, a Tri-Power version of the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|427 engine]]. The massive power plant required several mechanical changes to the car in order to fit, i.e. strengthened chassis components as well as an enlarged engine compartment with reinforced mounts. A large hood scoop (dubbed \"Penthouse\" due to its size) was added to clear for the engine's deck height. It produced an officially advertised minimum of {{convert|435|hp|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm, which was a somewhat conservative rating given the engine's well-known and proven performance potential. The factory claimed it could reach a top speed of {{convert|300|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1970, a styling change was made to the nose section of the car for the Grifo Series II. It was given a sleeker look and hide-away headlights. In the IR-9 \"Can Am\" version, the engine was switched from the 427 engines to the newer, even more powerful Chevrolet 454 7.4 litre engine.\n\nIn 1972, the Grifo IR-8 was released, using a small-block Ford Boss 351 engines. These models can be recognized by their taller hood scoop. This was the final version of any Iso automobile, as Iso S.P.A. closed its doors in 1974 during the 1970s oil crisis.<ref name=buckleyrees/>\n\n==Totals==\nIn total, 322 Series I and 78 Series II cars were built for a total of 413 Grifos, 90 of which were 7-litre. The rarest are the Series II 5-speeds (23 units) and the Series II Targa (4 units). Due to their rarity today Grifos are desirable collectibles.

This was the last new Iso of any type, as the manufacturer went bankrupt; it shut down and ceased all operations permanently in 1974.<ref name=buckleyrees/> The bankruptcy had a number of causes, perhaps the largest being the [[1973 oil crisis]], which significantly reduced demand for cars with large V8 engines.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Iso Grifo Rear.JPG|left|thumb|Iso Grifo Series I, rear view]]\n\nIso [[Joint-stock company|S.p.A.]] in [[Bresso]] was already well known for producing the high-performance [[Iso Rivolta IR 300]]; a sleek looking 2+2 Coupe based on a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] power and drive train.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silodrome.com/short-film-iso-rivolta-chronicles/|title=The Iso Rivolta Chronicles Film Series|date=2017-06-06|website=Silodrome}}</ref> After leaving [[Ferrari]], in 1961 [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] set up ''\u201cPrototipi Bizzarrini\u201d'' in [[Livorno]], [[Tuscany]] where he designed and consulted for marques such as ATS, [[Lamborghini]], and Iso.<ref name=Fearnley>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-2003/90/bizza-express|title=Bizza express|magazine=[[Motor Sport Magazine]]|page=90|issue=December 2003|author=Paul Fearnley|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> In 1963, he designed the Iso Grifo A3/L (\"L\" for ''Lusso'', Italian for \"luxury\") for [[Renzo Rivolta]], who was looking for a follow-up to his IR 300.<ref name=Fearnley/> The body was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] at [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]], while Bizzarrini put his expertise in the mechanicals.<ref name=scm201312/>  \n\nBizzarrini figured there would also be a demand for a race version of the Grifo and developed the A3/C (C for Corsa) with a dramatic, modified alloy body.<ref name=Fearnley/> He later dubbed it his \u201cImproved GTO.\" He designed the [[Ferrari 250 GTO|250 GTO]] when he had worked for Ferrari. In the Corsa, he moved the engine back about {{Convert|40|mm|abbr=on}}, making the A3/C a front, mid-engined car. To adjust the timing, mechanics had to remove a piece of the dashboard.<ref name=Fearnley/> Both cars were being built simultaneously. When leaving the factory, both the [[Ferrari 250 GTO|250 GTO]] and Iso Grifo were originally fitted with [[Pirelli Cinturato]] 205VR15 tires (CN72).\n\nAt the [[Turin Motor Show]] that same year, Bertone showed the Grifo A3/L prototype while Iso showed off the unpainted competition version: the Iso Grifo A3/C.<ref name=Frankel>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-2016/84/power-without-glory|title=Power without glory|magazine=[[Motor Sport Magazine]]|page=84|issue=March 2016|author=Andrew Frankel|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> Both became successful in their own right, the road car receiving praise from the press, while the racer performed very well although it had been made on a much tighter budget compared to [[Ferrari]].<ref name=Frankel/> Rivolta also showed a prototype A3/L Spyder at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\n==Grifo GL &ndash; Bizzarrini A3/C split==\nIso concentrated on getting the A3/L ready for production, concentrating on some of the design changes that had to be made to the prototype. The car got a light face-lift that made it less aggressive in appearance. It was given a modified but reliable [[Chevrolet small-block engine#327|Chevrolet small-block 327]] Corvette engine [[V8 engine|V8]] (5.4 L) engine\u2014either in 300 or 350&nbsp;hp\u2014coupled to a [[Borg-Warner]] 4-speed top-loader. The engines were completely ordered and manufactured in the [[United States]]; they were shipped to Italy where they were taken apart and blueprinted before they were eventually installed in the cars. This was similar to the manufacture of the IR 300. With over {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} and a weight of less than {{convert|2200|lb|abbr=on}}, the vehicle was able to reach speeds over {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1964, the prototype A3/C raced at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] (Edgar Berney/Pierre Noblet were drivers), running well until brake problems required a two-hour [[pit stop]].<ref name=Frankel/> The car resumed the race, finally finishing 14th. In 1965, the car performed better, finishing 9th at Le Mans.<ref name=Frankel/>\n\nThe production of the Iso Grifo GL started in 1965, but the Bizzarrini and Rivolta partnership quickly fell apart over the use of the name Grifo. This resulted in separate production of the Grifo GL and the competition Bizzarrini A3/C.<ref name=Frankel/><ref name=LM>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-1995/60/captain-scarlet|title=Captain Scarlet|magazine=[[Motor Sport Magazine]]|page=60|issue=December 1995|author=L M|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> The Grifo GL was produced at Bresso, while the A3/C was produced at Piero Drogo\u2019s Sports Cars of [[Modena]], under Bizzarini's strict supervision.

This was one of only thirteen Series I Targas ever built; later, only four series II Targas were built.<ref name=Gulett/>\n\n==Updates==\n[[File:Iso grifo can am.jpg|thumb|Iso Grifo Can Am with the characteristic 7-litre engine \"penthouse\" on the hood and Grifo Series II hide-away headlights]]\nIn 1968 the Grifo 7 Litri was introduced, featuring a Chevrolet L71 big-block engine, a Tri-Power version of the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|427 engine]]. The massive power plant required several mechanical changes to the car in order to fit, i.e. strengthened chassis components as well as an enlarged engine compartment with reinforced mounts. A large hood scoop (dubbed \"Penthouse\" due to its size) was added to clear for the engine's deck height. It produced an officially advertised minimum of {{convert|435|hp|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm, which was a somewhat conservative rating given the engine's well-known and proven performance potential. The factory claimed it could reach a top speed of {{convert|300|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1970, a styling change was made to the nose section of the car for the Grifo Series II. It was given a sleeker look and hide-away headlights. In the IR-9 \"Can Am\" version, the engine was switched from the 427 engines to the newer, even more powerful Chevrolet 454 7.4 litre engine.\n\nIn 1972, the Grifo IR-8 was released, using a small-block Ford Boss 351 engines. These models can be recognized by their taller hood scoop. This was the final version of any Iso automobile, as Iso S.P.A. closed its doors in 1974 during the 1970s oil crisis.<ref name=buckleyrees/>\n\n==Totals==\nIn total, 322 Series I and 78 Series II cars were built for a total of 413 Grifos, 90 of which were 7-litre. The rarest are the Series II 5-speeds (23 units) and the Series II Targa (4 units). Due to their rarity today Grifos are desirable collectibles.

The war plan of 1911, which was drafted under Rear Admiral [[Raymond P. Rodgers]], included an island-hopping strategy for approaching Japan.{{Sfn | Asada | 2006 | pp = 12\u201313, 22}}\n\nAfter World War I, the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]] gave Japan a mandate over former German colonies in the western Pacific; specifically, the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Marshall Islands|Marshall]], and [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] Islands.  If these islands were fortified, Japan could, in principle, deny the U.S. access to its interests in the western Pacific.  Therefore, in 1921, Major [[Earl Hancock Ellis]] of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] drafted \"Plan 712, Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia,\" a plan for war against Japan which updated War Plan Orange by incorporating modern military technology (submarines, aircraft, etc.) and which again included an island-hopping strategy.<ref>See:\n*  {{Citation | title = Plan 712, Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/ref/AdvBaseOps/ | publisher = iBiblio }}\n*  {{Citation | title = Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia | url = https://www.mca-marines.org/sites/default/files/OperationPlan712H.pdf | publisher = Marine Corps Association and Foundation | access-date = 2017-12-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160805081229/https://www.mca-marines.org/sites/default/files/OperationPlan712H.pdf | archive-date = 2016-08-05 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Shortly afterwards, a British reporter on naval affairs, [[Hector Charles Bywater]], publicized the prospect of a Japanese-American war in his books ''Seapower in the Pacific'' (1921)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bywater|first1=Hector C.|title=Sea-power in the Pacific: A Study of the American-Japanese Naval Problem|date=1921|publisher=Constable and Co., Ltd.|location=London, England|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023233822#page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref> and ''[[The Great Pacific War]]'' (1925), which detailed an island-hopping str\n The books were read not only by Americans but by senior officers of the [[Japanese Imperial Navy]],<ref name=\"honan197012\">{{cite journal | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/japan-strikes-1941 | title = Japan Strikes: 1941 | last =Honan | first = William H |author-link=William H.

Thus troops on islands which had been bypassed, such as the major base at [[Rabaul]], were useless to the Japanese war effort and left to \"wither on the vine\".  [[General Douglas MacArthur]] greatly supported this strategy in his effort to regain the [[Philippines]] from [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]].  This strategy began to be implemented in late 1943 in [[Operation Cartwheel]].{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 122}}  While MacArthur claimed to have invented the strategy, it initially came out of the Navy.{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 122}}\n\n== Advantages ==\nLeapfrogging would allow the United States forces to reach Japan quickly and not expend the time, manpower, and supplies to capture every Japanese-held island on the way. It would give the Allies the advantage of surprise and keep the Japanese off balance.{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 119}}  The overall leapfrogging strategy would involve two prongs. A force led by [[Admiral Chester Nimitz]], with a smaller land force and larger fleet, would advance north towards the island and capture the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Marianas]], going generally in the direction of the [[Bonin Islands]].{{Sfn | Collier | 1967 | p = 480}}  The southern prong, led by [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] and with larger land forces, would take the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]], [[New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], advancing toward the Philippines.{{Sfn | Collier | 1967 | p = 480}}\n\n== Exceptions ==\nThe principle of leapfrogging was not always followed in the Pacific. When MacArthur moved south to attack [[Mindanao]] after capturing the northern [[Philippines]], and when he instigated the reconquest of portions of [[Borneo]], he violated the \"basic tenets\" of island hopping.{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 151}}  In the first case, this may have been motivated by MacArthur's promise to return to the people of the Philippines as soon as possible.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Seabee]]\n* [[Unsinkable aircraft carrier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{citation | first = Sadao | last = Asada | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=B2FYVG-mBn0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = From Mahan to Pearl Harbor: The Imperial Japanese Navy and the United States | location = Annapolis, Maryland, USA | publisher = Naval Institute Press | year= 2006| isbn = 9781557500427 }}.\n* {{Citation | last = Collier | first = Basil | title = The Second World War: a Military History | place = New York | publisher = William Morrow & Co | year = 1967}}.\n* {{Citation | last1 = Roehrs | first1 = Mark D | first2 = William A | last2 = Renzi | title = World War II in the Pacific | edition = 2nd | place = London | publisher = ME Sharpe | year = 2004}}.\n\n{{World War II}}\n\n[[Category:Military strategy]]\n[[Category:Pacific theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:Military logistics]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|war tactics|the biological migration movement|Island hopping|the tactical counterpart|Leapfrogging (infantry)}}\n\n[[File:Second world war asia 1943-1945 map de.png|thumb|300px|right|Allied island-hopping campaign 1943\u20131945:<br>\n  Blue \u2013 Japanese-held territory Aug. 1945<br>\n  Dark red \u2013 Allied territory<br>\n  Red \u2013 Occupied Nov. 1943<br>\n  Dark pink \u2013 Occupied Apr. 1944<br>\n  Pink \u2013 Occupied Oct. 1944<br>\n  Light pink \u2013 Occupied Aug. 1945]]\n'''Leapfrogging''', also known as '''island hopping''', was a [[military strategy]] employed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the [[Pacific War]] against the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}{{dubious|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Background ==\nBy the late 19th century, the U.S. had several interests in the western Pacific to defend; namely, access to the Chinese market, and its colonies \u2013 the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Guam]] \u2013 which the U.S. had gained as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898).

The war plan of 1911, which was drafted under Rear Admiral [[Raymond P. Rodgers]], included an island-hopping strategy for approaching Japan.{{Sfn | Asada | 2006 | pp = 12\u201313, 22}}\n\nAfter World War I, the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]] gave Japan a mandate over former German colonies in the western Pacific; specifically, the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Marshall Islands|Marshall]], and [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] Islands.  If these islands were fortified, Japan could, in principle, deny the U.S. access to its interests in the western Pacific.  Therefore, in 1921, Major [[Earl Hancock Ellis]] of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] drafted \"Plan 712, Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia,\" a plan for war against Japan which updated War Plan Orange by incorporating modern military technology (submarines, aircraft, etc.) and which again included an island-hopping strategy.<ref>See:\n*  {{Citation | title = Plan 712, Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/ref/AdvBaseOps/ | publisher = iBiblio }}\n*  {{Citation | title = Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia | url = https://www.mca-marines.org/sites/default/files/OperationPlan712H.pdf | publisher = Marine Corps Association and Foundation | access-date = 2017-12-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160805081229/https://www.mca-marines.org/sites/default/files/OperationPlan712H.pdf | archive-date = 2016-08-05 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Shortly afterwards, a British reporter on naval affairs, [[Hector Charles Bywater]], publicized the prospect of a Japanese-American war in his books ''Seapower in the Pacific'' (1921)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bywater|first1=Hector C.|title=Sea-power in the Pacific: A Study of the American-Japanese Naval Problem|date=1921|publisher=Constable and Co., Ltd.|location=London, England|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023233822#page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref> and ''[[The Great Pacific War]]'' (1925), which detailed an island-hopping str\n The books were read not only by Americans but by senior officers of the [[Japanese Imperial Navy]],<ref name=\"honan197012\">{{cite journal | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/japan-strikes-1941 | title = Japan Strikes: 1941 | last =Honan | first = William H |author-link=William H.

Thus troops on islands which had been bypassed, such as the major base at [[Rabaul]], were useless to the Japanese war effort and left to \"wither on the vine\".  [[General Douglas MacArthur]] greatly supported this strategy in his effort to regain the [[Philippines]] from [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]].  This strategy began to be implemented in late 1943 in [[Operation Cartwheel]].{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 122}}  While MacArthur claimed to have invented the strategy, it initially came out of the Navy.{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 122}}\n\n== Advantages ==\nLeapfrogging would allow the United States forces to reach Japan quickly and not expend the time, manpower, and supplies to capture every Japanese-held island on the way. It would give the Allies the advantage of surprise and keep the Japanese off balance.{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 119}}  The overall leapfrogging strategy would involve two prongs. A force led by [[Admiral Chester Nimitz]], with a smaller land force and larger fleet, would advance north towards the island and capture the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Marianas]], going generally in the direction of the [[Bonin Islands]].{{Sfn | Collier | 1967 | p = 480}}  The southern prong, led by [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] and with larger land forces, would take the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]], [[New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], advancing toward the Philippines.{{Sfn | Collier | 1967 | p = 480}}\n\n== Exceptions ==\nThe principle of leapfrogging was not always followed in the Pacific. When MacArthur moved south to attack [[Mindanao]] after capturing the northern [[Philippines]], and when he instigated the reconquest of portions of [[Borneo]], he violated the \"basic tenets\" of island hopping.{{Sfn | Roehrs | Renzi | 2004 | p = 151}}  In the first case, this may have been motivated by MacArthur's promise to return to the people of the Philippines as soon as possible.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Seabee]]\n* [[Unsinkable aircraft carrier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{citation | first = Sadao | last = Asada | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=B2FYVG-mBn0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = From Mahan to Pearl Harbor: The Imperial Japanese Navy and the United States | location = Annapolis, Maryland, USA | publisher = Naval Institute Press | year= 2006| isbn = 9781557500427 }}.\n* {{Citation | last = Collier | first = Basil | title = The Second World War: a Military History | place = New York | publisher = William Morrow & Co | year = 1967}}.\n* {{Citation | last1 = Roehrs | first1 = Mark D | first2 = William A | last2 = Renzi | title = World War II in the Pacific | edition = 2nd | place = London | publisher = ME Sharpe | year = 2004}}.\n\n{{World War II}}\n\n[[Category:Military strategy]]\n[[Category:Pacific theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:Military logistics]]\n", "name_user": "74.65.50.232", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBackground)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrogging_(strategy)"}

{"title_page": "Environment variable", "text_new": "<!-- Note to editors regarding embedded anchors: In order to distinguish between environment variables for Unix, DOS and Windows in incoming links, all anchors for Unix/OSX-variables are prefixed with $, all anchors for DOS/MDOS/GEM/NetWare-variables are framed like %variable%, all anchors for OS/2-variables are prefixed with %, and all anchors for Windows-variables are not prefixed at all. Environment variables are listed as they are stored in the environment, although some systems are case-insensitive in regard to their case. If a variable exists in several case-variants, they should be listed separately (f.e. %COMSPEC% and %ComSpec%) and independent anchors should be created for them as well. (At present there are some parsing problem with links to %BETA%, %FBP_USER%, %DAY%, %DAY_OF_WEEK%, %CD%, %DATE%.) -->\n{{short description|user-definable variables associated with each running process in many operating systems}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nAn '''environment variable''' is a [[Name resolution (programming languages)|dynamic-named]] [[Value (computer science)|value]] that can affect the way running [[process (computing)|processes]] will behave on a computer.\n\nThey are part of the environment in which a process runs. For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store [[temporary file]]s, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the [[directory structure]] owned by the user running the process.\n\nThey were introduced in their modern form in 1979 with [[Version 7 Unix]], so are included in all [[Unix]] [[operating system]] flavors and variants from that point onward including [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. From [[PC&nbsp;DOS 2.0]] in 1982, all succeeding Microsoft operating systems including [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[OS/2]] also have included them as a feature, although with somewhat different syntax, usage and standard variable names.\n\n== Design ==\nIn all [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, each process has its own separate set of environment [[Variable (programming)|variable]]s.  By default, when a process is created, it inherits a duplicate environment of its parent process, except for explicit changes made by the parent when it creates the child. At the [[Application programming interface|API]] level, these changes must be done between running <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>. Alternatively, from [[command shell]]s such as [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via <code>[[env]]</code> or using the <code>ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE &lt;command&gt;</code> notation. A running program can access the values of environment variables for configuration purposes.\n\n[[Shell script]]s and batch files use environment variables to communicate data and preferences to [[child process]]es. They can also be used to store temporary values for reference later in a shell script. However, in Unix, [[#Unix|not exported variables]] are preferred for this as they don't leak outside the process.\n\nIn Unix, an environment variable that is changed in a script or compiled program will only affect that process and possibly child processes. The parent process and any unrelated processes will not be affected. Similarly, changing or removing a variable's value inside a [[DOS]] batch file will change the variable for the duration of <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code>'s existence.\n\nIn Unix, the environment variables are normally initialized during system startup by the system init scripts, and hence inherited by all other processes in the system. Users can, and often do, augment them in the profile script for the command shell they are using. In Microsoft Windows, each environment variable's default value is stored in the [[Windows registry]] or set in the <code>[[AUTOEXEC.BAT]]</code> file.\n\nOn [[Unix]], a [[setuid]] program is given an environment chosen by its caller, but it runs with different authority from its caller. The [[dynamic linker]] will usually load code from locations specified by the environment variables <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>$LD_PRELOAD</code> and run it with the process's authority. If a setuid program did this, it would be insecure, because its caller could get it to run arbitrary code and hence misuse its authority. For this reason, [[libc]] unsets these environment variables at startup in a setuid process. setuid programs usually unset unknown environment variables and check others or set them to reasonable values.\n\n== Syntax ==\nThe variables can be used both in scripts and on the [[command line]]. They are usually referenced by putting special symbols in front of or around the variable name. For instance, to display the user home directory, in most scripting environments, the user has to type:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\necho $HOME\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as <code>COMMAND.COM</code> and <code>cmd.exe</code>, the user has to type this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"dos\">\nECHO %HOME%\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn [[Windows PowerShell]], the user has to type this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"powershell\">\nWrite-Output $env:HOMEPATH\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe commands '''<code>[[env (shell)|env]]</code>''', '''<code>set</code>''', and '''<code>printenv</code>''' display all environment variables and their values. <code>printenv</code> can also be used to print a single variable by giving that variable name as the sole argument to the command.\n\n=== Assignment ===\nThe commands <code>env</code> and <code>set</code> are also used to set environment variables and are often incorporated directly into the shell.\n\n==== Unix ====\nIn Unix, the following commands can also be used, but are often dependent on a certain shell.\n\n ''VARIABLE''=''value''         #\n export ''VARIABLE''        # for [[Bourne shell|Bourne]] and related shells\n\n export ''VARIABLE''=''value''  # for [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], and related shells\n\n setenv ''VARIABLE'' ''value''  # for [[C shell|csh]] and related shells\n\nA few simple principles govern how environment variables achieve their effect.\n\nEnvironment variables are local to the process in which they were set. If two shell processes are spawned and the value of an environment variable is changed in one, that change will not be seen by the other.\n\nWhen a child process is created, it inherits all the environment variables and their values from the parent process. Usually, when a program calls another program, it first creates a child process by [[fork (system call)|fork]]ing, then the child adjusts the environment as needed and lastly the child [[exec (system call)|replaces]] itself with the program to be called. This procedure gives the calling program control over the environment of the called program.\n\nIn Unix and Unix-like systems, the names of environment variables are case-sensitive.\n\nIn Unix shells, variables may be assigned without the '''<code>export</code>''' keyword.  Variables defined in this way are displayed by the '''<code>set</code>''' command, but are '''not''' true environment variables, as they are stored only by the shell and are unknown to all other processes. The <code>printenv</code> command will not display them, and child processes do not inherit them.\n\n ''VARIABLE''=''value''\n\nThe prefix syntax exports a \"true\" environment variable to a child process without affecting the current process:<ref name=\"ClassicShS\"/>\n ''VARIABLE''=''value'' program_name [arguments]\n\nThe persistence of an environment variable can be session-wide or system-wide.\n\n'''unset''' is a builtin command implemented by both the [[Bourne shell]] family  (sh, ksh, bash, etc.) and the [[C shell]] family (csh, tcsh, etc.) of [[Unix shell|Unix command line shell]]s. It unsets a shell variable, removing it from memory and the shell's exported environment. It is implemented as a [[shell builtin]], because it directly manipulates the internals of the shell.<ref name=\"OG_unset\"/><ref name=\"Bash_unset\"/> Read-only shell variables cannot be unset. If one tries to unset a read-only variable, the unset command will print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.\n\n==== DOS, OS/2 and Windows ====\nIn DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as <code>COMMAND.COM</code> and <code>cmd.exe</code>, the '''<code>[[SET (DOS command)|SET]]</code>''' command is used to assign environment variables and values using the following arguments:\n SET ''VARIABLE''=''value''\n\nThe '''<code>SET</code>''' command without any arguments displays all environment variables along with their values.\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of environment variables include:\n\n* <code>[[PATH (variable)|PATH]]</code>: a list of directory paths. When the [[User (computing)|user]] types a command without providing the full path, this list is checked to see whether it contains a path that leads to the command.\n* <code>HOME</code> ([[Unix-like]]) and <code>USERPROFILE</code> (Microsoft Windows): indicate where a user's [[home directory]] is located in the [[file system]].\n* <code>HOME/{.AppName}</code> ([[Unix-like]]) and <code>APPDATA\\{DeveloperName\\AppName}</code> (Microsoft Windows): for storing application settings. Many applications incorrectly use <code>USERPROFILE</code> for application settings in Windows: <code>USERPROFILE</code> should only be used in dialogs that allow user to choose between paths like <code>Documents/Pictures/Downloads/Music</code>; for programmatic purposes, <code>APPDATA</code> (for roaming application settings shared across multiple devices), <code>LOCALAPPDATA</code> (for local application settings) or <code>PROGRAMDATA</code> (for application settings shared between multiple OS users) should be used.<ref name=\"appdata\"/>\n* <code>TERM</code> ([[Unix-like]]): specifies the type of [[computer terminal]] or [[terminal emulator]] being used (e.g., <code>[[vt100]]</code> or <code>[[dumb terminal|dumb]]</code>).\n* <code>PS1</code> ([[Unix-like]]): specifies how the prompt is displayed in the [[Bourne shell]] and variants.\n* <code>MAIL</code> ([[Unix-like]]): used to indicate where a user's mail is to be found.\n* <code>TEMP</code>: location where processes can store temporary files.\n\n== True environment variables ==\n\n==={{anchor|UNIX-ENV}}Unix ===\n{{anchor|$PATH}}\n{{See also|Path (computing)}}\n;<code>$PATH</code>: Contains a colon-separated list of directories that the shell searches for commands that do not contain a slash in their name (commands with slashes are interpreted as file names to execute, and the shell attempts to execute the files directly). It is equivalent to the [[DOS]], [[OS/2]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] <code>[[#%PATH%|%PATH%]]</code> variable.\n\n;{{anchor|$HOME}}<code>$HOME</code>: Contains the location of the user's [[home directory]]. Although the current user's home directory can also be found out through the C-functions <code>getpwuid</code> and <code>getuid</code>, <code>$HOME</code> is often used for convenience in various shell scripts (and other contexts). Using the environment variable also gives the user the possibility to point to another directory.\n\n;{{anchor|$PWD}}<code>$PWD</code>: This variable points to the current directory. Equivalent to the output of the command pwd when called without arguments.\n\n;{{anchor|$DISPLAY}}<code>$DISPLAY</code>: Contains the identifier for the display that [[X11]] programs should use by default.\n\n;{{anchor|$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}<code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>: On many Unix systems with a [[dynamic linker]], contains a colon-separated list of directories that the dynamic linker should search for [[shared object]]s when building a process image after <code>exec</code>, before searching in any other directories.\n\n;{{anchor|$LIBPATH}}<code>$LIBPATH</code> or <code>$SHLIB_PATH</code>: Alternatives to <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> typically used on older Unix versions.\n\n;{{anchor|$LANG|$LC_ALL|$LC_CTYPE|$LC_COLLATE|$LC_DATE}}<code>$LANG, $LC_ALL, $LC_...</code>: <code>$LANG</code> is used to set to the default [[Locale (computer software)|locale]]. For example, if the locale values are <code>pt_BR</code>, then the language is set to (Brazilian) Portuguese and Brazilian practice is used where relevant. Different aspects of localization are controlled by individual <code>$LC_</code>-variables (<code>$LC_CTYPE</code>, <code>$LC_[[collation|COLLATE]]</code>, <code>$LC_DATE</code> etc.). <code>$LC_ALL</code> can be used to force the same locale for all aspects.\n\n;{{anchor|$TZ}}<code>$TZ</code>: Refers to [[time zone]]. It can be in several formats, either specifying the timezone itself or referencing a file (in <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>).\n\n==={{anchor|DOS-ENV}}DOS ===\n{{anchor|Pre-environment|System environment|Master environment|Local environment|Pre-environment variable|System environment variable|Master environment variable|Local environment variable}}\nUnder DOS, the ''master environment'' is provided by the primary command processor, which inherits the ''pre-environment'' defined in <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> when first loaded. Its size can be configured through the <code>COMMAND /E:n</code> parameter between 160<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><!-- DR-DOS COMMAND: 128, MDOS: 120 --> and 32767<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><!-- DR-DOS COMMAND: 32751 --> bytes. ''Local environment'' segments inherited to child processes are typically reduced down to the size of the contents they hold. Some command-line processors (like [[4DOS]]) allow to define a minimum amount of free environment space that will be available when launching secondary shells.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> While the content of environment variables remains unchanged upon storage, their names (without the \"<code>%</code>\") are always converted to uppercase, with the exception of ''pre-environment variables'' defined via the <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code> directive <code>[[SET (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SET]]</code> under [[DR DOS 6.0]] and higher<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/> (and only with <code>[[SWITCHES (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHES=/L]]</code> (for \"allow lowercase names\") under [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher).<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> In principle, [[MS-DOS 7.0]] and higher also supports lowercase variable names (<code>[[#windir|%windir%]]</code>), but provides no means for the user to define them.<!-- but WIN.COM can set %windir% --> Environment variable names containing lowercase letters are stored in the environment just like normal environment variables, but remain invisible to most DOS software, since they are written to expect uppercase variables only.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/> Some command processors<!-- such as 4DOS --> limit the maximum length of a variable name to 80 characters.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> While principally only limited by the size of the ''environment segment'', some DOS and 16-bit Windows programs<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_ENVLEN128\"/> do not expect the contents of environment variables to exceed 128 characters. DR-DOS <code>COMMAND.COM</code> supports environment variables up to 255<!-- not 256 -->, [[4DOS]] even up to 512 characters.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> Since <code>COMMAND.COM</code> can be configured (via <code>/L:128..1024</code>) to support command lines up to 1024 characters internally under MS-DOS 7.0 and higher, environment variables should be expected to contain at least 1024 characters as well. In some versions of DR-DOS, the environment passed to drivers, which often do not need their environment after installation, can be shrunken or relocated through <code>SETENV</code> or <code>[[INSTALL (CONFIG.SYS directive)|INSTALL[HIGH]]]</code>/<code>[[LOADHIGH]]</code> options <code>/Z</code> (zero environment), <code>/D[:[[load drive|loaddrive]]]</code> (substitute drive, e.g. <code>B:TSR.COM</code>) and <code>/E</code> (relocate environment above program) in order to minimize the driver's effectively resulting resident memory footprint.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_SETENV\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CTMOUSE\"/><ref name=\"PTS-DOS_2000\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_COM\"/>\n\nIn batch mode, non-existent environment variables are replaced by a zero-length string.\n\n{{anchor|Reserved environment variable}}''Standard environment variables''<!-- DR-DOS term --> or ''reserved environment variables'' include:\n\n;{{anchor|%APPEND%}}<code>%APPEND%</code> (supported since DOS 3.3): This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which to search for files. It is usually changed via the <code>[[APPEND (DOS command)|APPEND]] /E</code> command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 121<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> characters, therefore the variable is best not modified via the <code>[[SET (DOS command)|SET]]</code> command. [[Long filename]]s containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (<code>\"</code>).\n\n;{{anchor|%CONFIG%}}<code>%CONFIG%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 6.0]] and [[PC DOS 6.1]], also supported by [[Datalight ROM-DOS|ROM-DOS]]<ref name=\"Datalight_2005_ROM-DOS\"/>): This variable holds the symbolic name of the currently chosen boot configuration. It is set by the [[DOS BIOS]] (<code>[[IO.SYS]]</code>, <code>[[IBMBIO.COM]]</code>, etc.) to the name defined by the corresponding <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code> directive <code>[[MENUITEM (CONFIG.SYS directive)|MENUITEM]]</code> before launching the primary command processor. Its main purpose is to allow further special cases in <code>[[AUTOEXEC.BAT]]</code> and similar batchjobs depending on the selected option at boot time. This can be emulated under DR-DOS by utilizing the <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> directive <code>[[SET (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SET]]</code> like <code>SET CONFIG=1</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|%CMDLINE%}}<code>%CMDLINE%</code> (introduced with [[4DOS]], also supported since [[MS-DOS 7.0]]): This variable contains the fully expanded text of the currently executing command line. It can be read by applications to detect the usage of and retrieve long command lines, since the traditional method to retrieve the command line arguments through the [[Program Segment Prefix|PSP]] (or related [[Application programming interface|API]] functions) is limited to 126 characters and is no longer available when [[File Control Block|FCB]]s get expanded or the default [[Disk Transfer Area|DTA]] is used. While 4DOS supports longer command lines, <code>COMMAND.COM</code> still only supports a maximum of 126 characters at the prompt by default (unless overridden with <code>/U:128..255</code> to specify the size of the command line buffer), but nevertheless internal command lines can become longer through f.e. variable expansion (depending on <code>/L:128..1024</code> to specify the size of the internal buffer). In addition to the command-line length byte in the PSP, the PSP command line is normally limited by [[ASCII 13|ASCII-13]], and command lines longer than 126 characters will typically be truncated by having an ASCII-13 inserted at position 127,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/> but this cannot be relied upon in all scenarios.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_CMDLINE\"/> The variable will be suppressed for external commands invoked with a preceding <code>@</code>-symbol like in <code>@XCOPY ...</code> for backward compatibility and in order to minimize the size of the environment when loading non-relocating [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]]s. Some beta versions of [[Microsoft Chicago]] used <code>%CMDLINE%</code> to store only the remainder of the command line excessing 126 characters instead of the complete command line.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%COMSPEC%}}<code>[[COMSPEC (environment variable)|%COMSPEC%]]</code> (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains the full [[8.3 filename|8.3]] path to the [[command processor]], typically <code>C:\\[[COMMAND.COM]]</code> or <code>C:\\DOS\\COMMAND.COM</code>. It must not contain [[long filenames]], but under DR-DOS it may contain file and directory passwords. It is set up by the primary command processor to point to itself (typically reflecting the settings of the <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code> directive <code>[[SHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SHELL]]</code>), so that the resident portion of the command processor can reload its transient portion from disk after the execution of larger programs. The value can be changed at runtime to reflect changes in the configuration, which would require the command processor to reload itself from other locations. The variable is also used when launching secondary shells.\n\n;{{anchor|%COPYCMD%}}<code>%COPYCMD%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 6.2]] and [[PC DOS 6.3]], also supported by [[Datalight ROM-DOS|ROM-DOS]]<ref name=\"Datalight_2005_ROM-DOS\"/>): Allows a user to specify the <code>/Y</code> switch (to assume \"Yes\" on queries) as the default for the <code>[[copy (command)|COPY]]</code>, <code>[[XCOPY]]</code>, and <code>[[move (command)|MOVE]]</code> commands. A default of <code>/Y</code> can be overridden by supplying the <code>/-Y</code> switch on the command line. The <code>/Y</code> switch instructs the command to replace existing files without prompting for confirmation.\n\n;{{anchor|%DIRCMD%}}<code>%DIRCMD%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 5.0]] and [[IBM DOS 5.0|PC DOS 5.0]], also supported by [[Datalight ROM-DOS|ROM-DOS]]<ref name=\"Datalight_2005_ROM-DOS\"/>): Allows a user to specify customized default parameters for the <code>[[dir (command)|DIR]]</code> command, including file specifications. Preset default switches can be overridden by providing the negative switch on the command line. For example, if <code>%DIRCMD%</code> contains the <code>/W</code> switch, then it can be overridden by using <code>DIR /-W</code> at the command line. This is similar to the environment variable <code>[[#%$DIR%|%$DIR%]]</code> under [[DOS Plus]]<ref name=\"Kotulla_1987_Environment\"/> and a facility to define default switches for <code>DIR</code> through its <code>/C</code> or <code>/R</code> switches under [[DR-DOS]] <code>COMMAND.COM</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> <code>%DIRCMD%</code> is also supported by the external <code>SDIR.COM</code>/<code>DIR.COM</code> [[Stacker (disk compression)|Stacker]] commands under [[Novell DOS 7]] and higher.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%LANG%}}<code>%LANG%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 7.0]]): This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.\n\n;{{anchor|%LANGSPEC%}}<code>%LANGSPEC%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 7.0]]): This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.\n\n;{{anchor|%NO_SEP%}}<code>%NO_SEP%</code> (supported since [[PC DOS 6.3]] and [[DR-DOS 7.07]]): This variable controls the display of [[Decimal separator#Digit grouping|thousands-separator]]s in messages of various commands. Issued by default, they can be suppressed by specifying <code>SET NO_SEP=ON</code> or <code>SET NO_SEP=1</code> under PC&nbsp;DOS. DR-DOS additionally allows to override the system's thousands-separator displayed as in f.e. <code>SET NO_SEP=.</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%PATH%}}<code>[[PATH (environment variable)|%PATH%]]</code> (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which the [[command interpreter]] will search for [[executable file]]s. Equivalent to the Unix <code>[[#$PATH|$PATH]]</code> variable (but some DOS and Windows applications also use the list to search for data files similar as <code>[[#$LD_LIBRARY_PATH|$LD_LIBRARY_PATH]]</code> on Unix-like systems). It is usually changed via the <code>[[PATH (DOS command)|PATH]]</code> (or <code>PATH /E</code> under [[MS-DOS 6.0]]) command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 123<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> characters,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_ENVLEN128\"/> therefore the variable should better not be modified via the <code>[[SET (DOS command)|SET]]</code> command.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> [[Long filename]]s containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (<code>\"</code>). By default, the current directory is searched first, but some command-line processors like [[4DOS]] allow \"<code>.</code>\" (for \"current directory\") to be included in the list as well in order to override this search order; some DOS programs are incompatible with this extension.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%PROMPT%}}<code>%PROMPT%</code> (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains a <code>$</code>-tokenized string defining the display of the [[prompt (computing)|prompt]]. It is usually changed via the <code>[[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]</code> command.\n\n;{{anchor|%TEMP%|%TMP%}}<code>%TEMP%</code> (and <code>%TMP%</code>): These variables contain the path to the directory where [[temporary file]]s should be stored. Operating system tools typically only use <code>%TEMP%</code>, whereas third-party programs also use <code>%TMP%</code>. Typically <code>%TEMP%</code> takes precedence over <code>%TMP%</code>.\n\nThe [[DR-DOS]] family supports a number of additional ''standard environment variables''<!-- DR-DOS term --> including:\n\n;{{anchor|%BETA%}}<code>%BETA%</code>: This variable contains an optional message displayed by some versions (including [[DR DOS 3.41]]<!-- not supported by DR DOS 3.31-3.40 -->) of <code>COMMAND.COM</code> at the startup of secondary shells.<ref name=\"Paul_2002_CLS\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%DRDOSCFG%|%NWDOSCFG%|%OPENDOSCFG%}}<code>%DRDOSCFG%</code>/<code>%NWDOSCFG%</code>/<code>%OPENDOSCFG%</code>: This variable contains the directory<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER\"/> (without trailing \"<code>\\</code>\") where to search for <code>.INI</code> and <code>.CFG</code> configuration files (that is, DR-DOS application specific files like <code>TASKMGR.INI</code>, <code>TASKMAX.INI</code>, <code>[[VIEWMAX.INI]]</code>, <code>FASTBACK.CFG</code> etc., class specific files like <code>COLORS.INI</code>, or global files like <code>[[DRDOS.INI]]</code>, <code>[[NWDOS.INI]]</code>, <code>[[OPENDOS.INI]]</code>, or <code>[[DOS.INI]]</code>), as used by the <code>INSTALL</code> and <code>SETUP</code> commands and various DR-DOS programs like <code>DISKOPT</code>, <code>DOSBOOK</code>, <code>EDIT</code>, <code>FBX</code>, <code>FILELINK</code>, <code>LOCK</code>, <code>SECURITY.OVL</code>/<code>NWLOGIN.EXE</code>, <code>SERNO</code>, <code>TASKMAX</code>, <code>TASKMGR</code>, <code>[[VIEWMAX]]</code>, or <code>UNDELETE</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> It must not contain [[long filename]]s.\n\n;{{anchor|%DRCOMSPEC%}}<code>%DRCOMSPEC%</code>: This variable optionally holds an alternative path to the command processor taking precedence over the path defined in the <code>%COMSPEC%</code> variable, optionally including file and directory passwords. Alternatively, it can hold a special value of \"<code>ON</code>\" or \"<code>1</code>\" in order to enforce the usage of the <code>%COMSPEC%</code> variable even in scenarios where the <code>%COMSPEC%</code> variable may point to the wrong command-line processor, for example, when running some versions of the DR-DOS <code>[[SYS (command)|SYS]]</code> command under a foreign operating system.<ref name=\"Paul_2017\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%DRSYS%}}<code>%DRSYS%</code>: Setting this variable to \"<code>ON</code>\" or \"<code>1</code>\" will force some versions of the DR-DOS <code>[[SYS (command)|SYS]]</code> command to work under foreign operating systems instead of displaying a warning.<ref name=\"Paul_2017\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%FBP_USER%|FBP_USER}}<code>%FBP_USER%</code>: Specifies the user name used by the [[FastBack]] command <code>[[FBX (DOS command)|FBX]]</code> and <code>{user}[[.FB]]</code> configuration files under [[Novell DOS 7]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%HOMEDIR%}}<code>%HOMEDIR%</code>: This variable may contain the home directory under DR-DOS (including [[DR DOS 5.0]] and [[DR DOS 6.0|6.0]]).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CLS\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%INFO%}}<code>%INFO%</code>: In some versions of DR-DOS <code>COMMAND.COM</code> this variable defines the string displayed by the <code>$I</code> token of the <code>[[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]</code> command.<ref name=\"Paul_2002_CLS\"/> It can be used, for example, to inform the user how to exit secondary shells.\n\n;{{anchor|%LOGINNAME%}}<code>%LOGINNAME%</code>: In some versions of DR-DOS <code>COMMAND.COM</code> this variable defines the user name displayed by the <code>$U</code> token of the <code>[[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]</code> command, as set up by f.e. login scripts for [[Novell NetWare]].<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CLS\"/> See also the similarly named pseudo-variable <code>[[#%LOGIN_NAME%|%LOGIN_NAME%]]</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|%MDOS_EXEC%}}<code>%MDOS_EXEC%</code>: This variable can take the values \"<code>ON</code>\" or \"<code>OFF</code>\" under [[Multiuser DOS]].<!-- f.e CCI Multiuser DOS 7.22 GOLD --> If enabled, the operating system permits applications to shell out to secondary shells with the [[DOS Program Area]] (DPA) freed in order to have maximum DOS memory available for secondary applications instead of running them in the same domain as under DOS.<ref name=\"CCI_1997_HELP\"/><ref name=\"CCI_1997_PRINTDOC\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%NOCHAR%}}<code>%NOCHAR%</code>: This variable can be used to define the character displayed by some commands in messages for \"No\" in <code>[Y,N]</code> queries, thereby overriding the current system default (typically \"<code>N</code>\" in English versions of DR-DOS). If it contains a string, only the first character, uppercased, will be taken. Some commands also support a command line parameter <code>/Y</code> to automatically assume \"Yes\" on queries, thereby suppressing such prompts. If, however, the parameter <code>/Y:yn</code> is used to specify the \"Yes\"/\"No\" characters (thereby overriding any <code>%NOCHAR%</code> setting), queries are not suppressed.

This always worked with <code>[[NETX]]</code>, but it will also work with [[Personal NetWare]]'s [[Open Data-Link Interface|ODI]]/[[Virtual Loadable Module|VLM]]<!-- since Novell DOS 7 Update 14 --> if the current drive is a PNW-mapped drive (otherwise an empty string is returned). See also the similarly named environment variable <code>[[#%LOGINNAME%|%LOGINNAME%]]</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|%P_STATION%}}<code>%P_STATION%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the physical station number in a format \"<code>????????????</code>\". The value depends on the [[MAC address]] of the network adapter, but can be overridden. It resembles an identically named ''identifier variable'' in [[Novell NetWare]] login scripts.\n\n;{{anchor|%STATION%}}<code>%STATION%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the logical station number starting with \"<code>1</code>\" for the first client. The numbers are assigned by the file server and remain static for as long as the [[IPX]] connection remains established. It resembles an identically named ''identifier variable'' in [[Novell NetWare]] login scripts.\n\n;{{anchor|%FULL_NAME%}}<code>%FULL_NAME%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the full name of the logged in user, if available. It resembles an identically named ''identifier variable'' in [[Novell NetWare]] login scripts. See also the related pseudo-variable <code>[[#%LOGIN_NAME%|%LOGIN_NAME%]]</code>.\n\n==={{anchor|WIN-PSEUDOENV}}Windows ===\n''Dynamic environment variables'' (also named ''internal variables'' or ''system information variables'' under DOS) are pseudo-environment variables supported by <code>[[CMD (Windows)|CMD]]</code> when command-line extensions are enabled, and they expand to various discrete values whenever queried, that is, their values can change when queried multiple times even within the same command. While they can be used in batch jobs and at the prompt, they are not stored in the environment. Consequently, they are neither listed by <code>SET</code> nor do they exist for external programs to read. They are not case-sensitive.\n\nIndirectly, they are also supported under Windows' <code>COMMAND.COM</code>, which has been modified to internally call <code>CMD.EXE</code> to execute the commands.<!-- see ECHO %CMDCMDLINE% under COMMAND.COM -->\n\n;{{anchor|CD}}<code>%CD%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the current directory equivalent to the output of the command <code>[[cd (command)|CD]]</code> when called without arguments. While a long filename can be returned under <code>CMD.EXE</code> depending on the current directory, the fact that the current directory will always be in [[8.3 filename|8.3]] format under <code>COMMAND.COM</code> will cause it to return a short filename under <code>COMMAND.COM</code>, even when <code>COMMAND</code> internally calls <code>CMD</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|CMDCMDLINE}}<code>%CMDCMDLINE%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the original startup parameters of <code>[[CMD.EXE]]</code>, f.e. \"<code>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe</code>\". Under Windows' <code>COMMAND.COM</code>, this may return something like \"<code>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c ...</code>\" due to the fact that <code>COMMAND.COM</code> calls <code>CMD.EXE</code> internally.\n\n;{{anchor|CMDEXTVERSION}}<code>%CMDEXTVERSION%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the version of the command-line extensions of <code>[[CMD.EXE]]</code>, if enabled (e.g. \"<code>1</code>\" under [[Windows NT]], \"<code>2</code>\" under [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]]).\n\n;{{anchor|DATE}}<code>%DATE%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the current date. The date is displayed according to the current user's [[Calendar date|date format]] preferences.\n\n;{{anchor|ERRORLEVEL}}<code>%ERRORLEVEL%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the last set error level, a value between \"<code>0</code>\" and \"<code>255</code>\" (without leading zeros).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\"/><ref name=\"Allen_2005\"/><ref name=\"FD_2003_Errorlevel\"/> External commands and some internal commands set error levels upon execution. See also the identically named pseudo-variable <code>[[#%ERRORLEVEL%|%ERRORLEVEL%]]</code> under DR-DOS and the <code>[[IF ERRORLEVEL (Windows command)|IF ERRORLEVEL]]</code> command.\n\n;{{anchor|RANDOM}}<code>%RANDOM%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns a random number between \"<code>0</code>\" and \"<code>32767</code>\".\n\n;{{anchor|TIME}}<code>%TIME%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the current time. The time is displayed according to the current user's time format preferences. If the <code>%TIME%</code> and <code>[[#DATE|%DATE%]]</code> variables are both used, it is important to read them both in this particular order in rapid succession in order to avoid midnight-rollover problems.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Variable (computer science)]]\n* [[List of Unix commands]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Special folder]]\n* [[Modules Environment]]\n* [[PWB shell]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_CMDLINE\">[[4DOS]] and [[MS-DOS 7.0]] set the length to 127 and insert [[ASCII 13|ASCII-13]] at this position, but [[Borland]] libraries set the length to the invalid value of 128 and do not insert an ASCII-13.

For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store [[temporary file]]s, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the [[directory structure]] owned by the user running the process.\n\nThey were introduced in their modern form in 1979 with [[Version 7 Unix]], so are included in all [[Unix]] [[operating system]] flavors and variants from that point onward including [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. From [[PC&nbsp;DOS 2.0]] in 1982, all succeeding Microsoft operating systems including [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[OS/2]] also have included them as a feature, although with somewhat different syntax, usage and standard variable names.\n\n== Design ==\nIn all [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, each process has its own separate set of environment [[Variable (programming)|variable]]s.  By default, when a process is created, it inherits a duplicate environment of its parent process, except for explicit changes made by the parent when it creates the child. At the [[Application programming interface|API]] level, these changes must be done between running <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>. Alternatively, from [[command shell]]s such as [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via <code>[[env]]</code> or using the <code>ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE &lt;command&gt;</code> notation. A running program can access the values of environment variables for configuration purposes.\n\n[[Shell script]]s and batch files use environment variables to communicate data and preferences to [[child process]]es. They can also be used to store temporary values for reference later in a shell script. However, in Unix, [[#Unix|not exported variables]] are preferred for this as they don't leak outside the process.\n\nIn Unix, an environment variable that is changed in a script or compiled program will only affect that process and possibly child processes. The parent process and any unrelated processes will not be affected. Similarly, changing or removing a variable's value inside a [[DOS]] batch file will change the variable for the duration of <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code>'s existence.\n\nIn Unix, the environment variables are normally initialized during system startup by the system init scripts, and hence inherited by all other processes in the system. Users can, and often do, augment them in the profile script for the command shell they are using. In Microsoft Windows, each environment variable's default value is stored in the [[Windows registry]] or set in the <code>[[AUTOEXEC.BAT]]</code> file.\n\nOn [[Unix]], a [[setuid]] program is given an environment chosen by its caller, but it runs with different authority from its caller. The [[dynamic linker]] will usually load code from locations specified by the environment variables <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>$LD_PRELOAD</code> and run it with the process's authority. If a setuid program did this, it would be insecure, because its caller could get it to run arbitrary code and hence misuse its authority. For this reason, [[libc]] unsets these environment variables at startup in a setuid process. setuid programs usually unset unknown environment variables and check others or set them to reasonable values.\n\n== Syntax ==\nThe variables can be used both in scripts and on the [[command line]]. They are usually referenced by putting special symbols in front of or around the variable name. For instance, to display the user home directory, in most scripting environments, the user has to type:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\necho $HOME\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as <code>COMMAND.COM</code> and <code>cmd.exe</code>, the user has to type this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"dos\">\nECHO %HOME%\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn [[Windows PowerShell]], the user has to type this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"powershell\">\nWrite-Output $env:HOMEPATH\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe commands '''<code>[[env (shell)|env]]</code>''', '''<code>set</code>''', and '''<code>printenv</code>''' display all environment variables and their values. <code>printenv</code> can also be used to print a single variable by giving that variable name as the sole argument to the command.\n\n=== Assignment ===\nThe commands <code>env</code> and <code>set</code> are also used to set environment variables and are often incorporated directly into the shell.\n\n==== Unix ====\nIn Unix, the following commands can also be used, but are often dependent on a certain shell.\n\n ''VARIABLE''=''value''         #\n export ''VARIABLE''        # for [[Bourne shell|Bourne]] and related shells\n\n export ''VARIABLE''=''value''  # for [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], and related shells\n\n setenv ''VARIABLE'' ''value''  # for [[C shell|csh]] and related shells\n\nA few simple principles govern how environment variables achieve their effect.\n\nEnvironment variables are local to the process in which they were set. If two shell processes are spawned and the value of an environment variable is changed in one, that change will not be seen by the other.\n\nWhen a child process is created, it inherits all the environment variables and their values from the parent process. Usually, when a program calls another program, it first creates a child process by [[fork (system call)|fork]]ing, then the child adjusts the environment as needed and lastly the child [[exec (system call)|replaces]] itself with the program to be called. This procedure gives the calling program control over the environment of the called program.\n\nIn Unix and Unix-like systems, the names of environment variables are case-sensitive.\n\nIn Unix shells, variables may be assigned without the '''<code>export</code>''' keyword.  Variables defined in this way are displayed by the '''<code>set</code>''' command, but are '''not''' true environment variables, as they are stored only by the shell and are unknown to all other processes. The <code>printenv</code> command will not display them, and child processes do not inherit them.\n\n ''VARIABLE''=''value''\n\nThe prefix syntax exports a \"true\" environment variable to a child process without affecting the current process:<ref name=\"ClassicShS\"/>\n ''VARIABLE''=''value'' program_name [arguments]\n\nThe persistence of an environment variable can be session-wide or system-wide.\n\n'''unset''' is a builtin command implemented by both the [[Bourne shell]] family  (sh, ksh, bash, etc.) and the [[C shell]] family (csh, tcsh, etc.) of [[Unix shell|Unix command line shell]]s. It unsets a shell variable, removing it from memory and the shell's exported environment. It is implemented as a [[shell builtin]], because it directly manipulates the internals of the shell.<ref name=\"OG_unset\"/><ref name=\"Bash_unset\"/> Read-only shell variables cannot be unset. If one tries to unset a read-only variable, the unset command will print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.\n\n==== DOS, OS/2 and Windows ====\nIn DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as <code>COMMAND.COM</code> and <code>cmd.exe</code>, the '''<code>[[SET (DOS command)|SET]]</code>''' command is used to assign environment variables and values using the following arguments:\n SET ''VARIABLE''=''value''\n\nThe '''<code>SET</code>''' command without any arguments displays all environment variables along with their values.\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of environment variables include:\n\n* <code>[[PATH (variable)|PATH]]</code>: a list of directory paths. When the [[User (computing)|user]] types a command without providing the full path, this list is checked to see whether it contains a path that leads to the command.\n* <code>HOME</code> ([[Unix-like]]) and <code>USERPROFILE</code> (Microsoft Windows): indicate where a user's [[home directory]] is located in the [[file system]].\n* <code>HOME/{.AppName}</code> ([[Unix-like]]) and <code>APPDATA\\{DeveloperName\\AppName}</code> (Microsoft Windows): for storing application settings. Many applications incorrectly use <code>USERPROFILE</code> for application settings in Windows: <code>USERPROFILE</code> should only be used in dialogs that allow user to choose between paths like <code>Documents/Pictures/Downloads/Music</code>; for programmatic purposes, <code>APPDATA</code> (for roaming application settings shared across multiple devices), <code>LOCALAPPDATA</code> (for local application settings) or <code>PROGRAMDATA</code> (for application settings shared between multiple OS users) should be used.<ref name=\"appdata\"/>\n* <code>TERM</code> ([[Unix-like]]): specifies the type of [[computer terminal]] or [[terminal emulator]] being used (e.g., <code>[[vt100]]</code> or <code>[[dumb terminal|dumb]]</code>).\n* <code>PS1</code> ([[Unix-like]]): specifies how the prompt is displayed in the [[Bourne shell]] and variants.\n* <code>MAIL</code> ([[Unix-like]]): used to indicate where a user's mail is to be found.\n* <code>TEMP</code>: location where processes can store temporary files.\n\n== True environment variables ==\n\n==={{anchor|UNIX-ENV}}Unix ===\n{{anchor|$PATH}}\n{{See also|Path (computing)}}\n;<code>$PATH</code>: Contains a colon-separated list of directories that the shell searches for commands that do not contain a slash in their name (commands with slashes are interpreted as file names to execute, and the shell attempts to execute the files directly). It is equivalent to the [[DOS]], [[OS/2]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] <code>[[#%PATH%|%PATH%]]</code> variable.\n\n;{{anchor|$HOME}}<code>$HOME</code>: Contains the location of the user's [[home directory]]. Although the current user's home directory can also be found out through the C-functions <code>getpwuid</code> and <code>getuid</code>, <code>$HOME</code> is often used for convenience in various shell scripts (and other contexts). Using the environment variable also gives the user the possibility to point to another directory.\n\n;{{anchor|$PWD}}<code>$PWD</code>: This variable points to the current directory. Equivalent to the output of the command pwd when called without arguments.\n\n;{{anchor|$DISPLAY}}<code>$DISPLAY</code>: Contains the identifier for the display that [[X11]] programs should use by default.\n\n;{{anchor|$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}<code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>: On many Unix systems with a [[dynamic linker]], contains a colon-separated list of directories that the dynamic linker should search for [[shared object]]s when building a process image after <code>exec</code>, before searching in any other directories.\n\n;{{anchor|$LIBPATH}}<code>$LIBPATH</code> or <code>$SHLIB_PATH</code>: Alternatives to <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> typically used on older Unix versions.\n\n;{{anchor|$LANG|$LC_ALL|$LC_CTYPE|$LC_COLLATE|$LC_DATE}}<code>$LANG, $LC_ALL, $LC_...</code>: <code>$LANG</code> is used to set to the default [[Locale (computer software)|locale]]. For example, if the locale values are <code>pt_BR</code>, then the language is set to (Brazilian) Portuguese and Brazilian practice is used where relevant. Different aspects of localization are controlled by individual <code>$LC_</code>-variables (<code>$LC_CTYPE</code>, <code>$LC_[[collation|COLLATE]]</code>, <code>$LC_DATE</code> etc.). <code>$LC_ALL</code> can be used to force the same locale for all aspects.\n\n;{{anchor|$TZ}}<code>$TZ</code>: Refers to [[time zone]]. It can be in several formats, either specifying the timezone itself or referencing a file (in <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>).\n\n==={{anchor|DOS-ENV}}DOS ===\n{{anchor|Pre-environment|System environment|Master environment|Local environment|Pre-environment variable|System environment variable|Master environment variable|Local environment variable}}\nUnder DOS, the ''master environment'' is provided by the primary command processor, which inherits the ''pre-environment'' defined in <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> when first loaded. Its size can be configured through the <code>COMMAND /E:n</code> parameter between 160<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><!-- DR-DOS COMMAND: 128, MDOS: 120 --> and 32767<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><!-- DR-DOS COMMAND: 32751 --> bytes. ''Local environment'' segments inherited to child processes are typically reduced down to the size of the contents they hold. Some command-line processors (like [[4DOS]]) allow to define a minimum amount of free environment space that will be available when launching secondary shells.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> While the content of environment variables remains unchanged upon storage, their names (without the \"<code>%</code>\") are always converted to uppercase, with the exception of ''pre-environment variables'' defined via the <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code> directive <code>[[SET (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SET]]</code> under [[DR DOS 6.0]] and higher<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/> (and only with <code>[[SWITCHES (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHES=/L]]</code> (for \"allow lowercase names\") under [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher).<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> In principle, [[MS-DOS 7.0]] and higher also supports lowercase variable names (<code>[[#windir|%windir%]]</code>), but provides no means for the user to define them.<!-- but WIN.COM can set %windir% --> Environment variable names containing lowercase letters are stored in the environment just like normal environment variables, but remain invisible to most DOS software, since they are written to expect uppercase variables only.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/> Some command processors<!-- such as 4DOS --> limit the maximum length of a variable name to 80 characters.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> While principally only limited by the size of the ''environment segment'', some DOS and 16-bit Windows programs<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_ENVLEN128\"/> do not expect the contents of environment variables to exceed 128 characters. DR-DOS <code>COMMAND.COM</code> supports environment variables up to 255<!-- not 256 -->, [[4DOS]] even up to 512 characters.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> Since <code>COMMAND.COM</code> can be configured (via <code>/L:128..1024</code>) to support command lines up to 1024 characters internally under MS-DOS 7.0 and higher, environment variables should be expected to contain at least 1024 characters as well. In some versions of DR-DOS, the environment passed to drivers, which often do not need their environment after installation, can be shrunken or relocated through <code>SETENV</code> or <code>[[INSTALL (CONFIG.SYS directive)|INSTALL[HIGH]]]</code>/<code>[[LOADHIGH]]</code> options <code>/Z</code> (zero environment), <code>/D[:[[load drive|loaddrive]]]</code> (substitute drive, e.g. <code>B:TSR.COM</code>) and <code>/E</code> (relocate environment above program) in order to minimize the driver's effectively resulting resident memory footprint.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_SETENV\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CTMOUSE\"/><ref name=\"PTS-DOS_2000\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_COM\"/>\n\nIn batch mode, non-existent environment variables are replaced by a zero-length string.\n\n{{anchor|Reserved environment variable}}''Standard environment variables''<!-- DR-DOS term --> or ''reserved environment variables'' include:\n\n;{{anchor|%APPEND%}}<code>%APPEND%</code> (supported since DOS 3.3): This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which to search for files. It is usually changed via the <code>[[APPEND (DOS command)|APPEND]] /E</code> command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 121<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> characters, therefore the variable is best not modified via the <code>[[SET (DOS command)|SET]]</code> command. [[Long filename]]s containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (<code>\"</code>).\n\n;{{anchor|%CONFIG%}}<code>%CONFIG%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 6.0]] and [[PC DOS 6.1]], also supported by [[Datalight ROM-DOS|ROM-DOS]]<ref name=\"Datalight_2005_ROM-DOS\"/>): This variable holds the symbolic name of the currently chosen boot configuration. It is set by the [[DOS BIOS]] (<code>[[IO.SYS]]</code>, <code>[[IBMBIO.COM]]</code>, etc.) to the name defined by the corresponding <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code> directive <code>[[MENUITEM (CONFIG.SYS directive)|MENUITEM]]</code> before launching the primary command processor. Its main purpose is to allow further special cases in <code>[[AUTOEXEC.BAT]]</code> and similar batchjobs depending on the selected option at boot time. This can be emulated under DR-DOS by utilizing the <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> directive <code>[[SET (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SET]]</code> like <code>SET CONFIG=1</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|%CMDLINE%}}<code>%CMDLINE%</code> (introduced with [[4DOS]], also supported since [[MS-DOS 7.0]]): This variable contains the fully expanded text of the currently executing command line. It can be read by applications to detect the usage of and retrieve long command lines, since the traditional method to retrieve the command line arguments through the [[Program Segment Prefix|PSP]] (or related [[Application programming interface|API]] functions) is limited to 126 characters and is no longer available when [[File Control Block|FCB]]s get expanded or the default [[Disk Transfer Area|DTA]] is used. While 4DOS supports longer command lines, <code>COMMAND.COM</code> still only supports a maximum of 126 characters at the prompt by default (unless overridden with <code>/U:128..255</code> to specify the size of the command line buffer), but nevertheless internal command lines can become longer through f.e. variable expansion (depending on <code>/L:128..1024</code> to specify the size of the internal buffer). In addition to the command-line length byte in the PSP, the PSP command line is normally limited by [[ASCII 13|ASCII-13]], and command lines longer than 126 characters will typically be truncated by having an ASCII-13 inserted at position 127,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/> but this cannot be relied upon in all scenarios.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_CMDLINE\"/> The variable will be suppressed for external commands invoked with a preceding <code>@</code>-symbol like in <code>@XCOPY ...</code> for backward compatibility and in order to minimize the size of the environment when loading non-relocating [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]]s. Some beta versions of [[Microsoft Chicago]] used <code>%CMDLINE%</code> to store only the remainder of the command line excessing 126 characters instead of the complete command line.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%COMSPEC%}}<code>[[COMSPEC (environment variable)|%COMSPEC%]]</code> (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains the full [[8.3 filename|8.3]] path to the [[command processor]], typically <code>C:\\[[COMMAND.COM]]</code> or <code>C:\\DOS\\COMMAND.COM</code>. It must not contain [[long filenames]], but under DR-DOS it may contain file and directory passwords. It is set up by the primary command processor to point to itself (typically reflecting the settings of the <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code> directive <code>[[SHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SHELL]]</code>), so that the resident portion of the command processor can reload its transient portion from disk after the execution of larger programs. The value can be changed at runtime to reflect changes in the configuration, which would require the command processor to reload itself from other locations. The variable is also used when launching secondary shells.\n\n;{{anchor|%COPYCMD%}}<code>%COPYCMD%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 6.2]] and [[PC DOS 6.3]], also supported by [[Datalight ROM-DOS|ROM-DOS]]<ref name=\"Datalight_2005_ROM-DOS\"/>): Allows a user to specify the <code>/Y</code> switch (to assume \"Yes\" on queries) as the default for the <code>[[copy (command)|COPY]]</code>, <code>[[XCOPY]]</code>, and <code>[[move (command)|MOVE]]</code> commands. A default of <code>/Y</code> can be overridden by supplying the <code>/-Y</code> switch on the command line. The <code>/Y</code> switch instructs the command to replace existing files without prompting for confirmation.\n\n;{{anchor|%DIRCMD%}}<code>%DIRCMD%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 5.0]] and [[IBM DOS 5.0|PC DOS 5.0]], also supported by [[Datalight ROM-DOS|ROM-DOS]]<ref name=\"Datalight_2005_ROM-DOS\"/>): Allows a user to specify customized default parameters for the <code>[[dir (command)|DIR]]</code> command, including file specifications. Preset default switches can be overridden by providing the negative switch on the command line. For example, if <code>%DIRCMD%</code> contains the <code>/W</code> switch, then it can be overridden by using <code>DIR /-W</code> at the command line. This is similar to the environment variable <code>[[#%$DIR%|%$DIR%]]</code> under [[DOS Plus]]<ref name=\"Kotulla_1987_Environment\"/> and a facility to define default switches for <code>DIR</code> through its <code>/C</code> or <code>/R</code> switches under [[DR-DOS]] <code>COMMAND.COM</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> <code>%DIRCMD%</code> is also supported by the external <code>SDIR.COM</code>/<code>DIR.COM</code> [[Stacker (disk compression)|Stacker]] commands under [[Novell DOS 7]] and higher.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%LANG%}}<code>%LANG%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 7.0]]): This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.\n\n;{{anchor|%LANGSPEC%}}<code>%LANGSPEC%</code> (supported since [[MS-DOS 7.0]]): This variable is supported by some tools to switch the locale for messages in multilingual issues.\n\n;{{anchor|%NO_SEP%}}<code>%NO_SEP%</code> (supported since [[PC DOS 6.3]] and [[DR-DOS 7.07]]): This variable controls the display of [[Decimal separator#Digit grouping|thousands-separator]]s in messages of various commands. Issued by default, they can be suppressed by specifying <code>SET NO_SEP=ON</code> or <code>SET NO_SEP=1</code> under PC&nbsp;DOS. DR-DOS additionally allows to override the system's thousands-separator displayed as in f.e. <code>SET NO_SEP=.</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%PATH%}}<code>[[PATH (environment variable)|%PATH%]]</code> (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains a semicolon-delimited list of directories in which the [[command interpreter]] will search for [[executable file]]s. Equivalent to the Unix <code>[[#$PATH|$PATH]]</code> variable (but some DOS and Windows applications also use the list to search for data files similar as <code>[[#$LD_LIBRARY_PATH|$LD_LIBRARY_PATH]]</code> on Unix-like systems). It is usually changed via the <code>[[PATH (DOS command)|PATH]]</code> (or <code>PATH /E</code> under [[MS-DOS 6.0]]) command, which also ensures that the directory names are converted into uppercase. Some DOS software actually expects the names to be stored in uppercase and the length of the list not to exceed 123<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> characters,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_ENVLEN128\"/> therefore the variable should better not be modified via the <code>[[SET (DOS command)|SET]]</code> command.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> [[Long filename]]s containing spaces or other special characters must not be quoted (<code>\"</code>). By default, the current directory is searched first, but some command-line processors like [[4DOS]] allow \"<code>.</code>\" (for \"current directory\") to be included in the list as well in order to override this search order; some DOS programs are incompatible with this extension.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%PROMPT%}}<code>%PROMPT%</code> (supported since DOS 2.0): This variable contains a <code>$</code>-tokenized string defining the display of the [[prompt (computing)|prompt]]. It is usually changed via the <code>[[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]</code> command.\n\n;{{anchor|%TEMP%|%TMP%}}<code>%TEMP%</code> (and <code>%TMP%</code>): These variables contain the path to the directory where [[temporary file]]s should be stored. Operating system tools typically only use <code>%TEMP%</code>, whereas third-party programs also use <code>%TMP%</code>. Typically <code>%TEMP%</code> takes precedence over <code>%TMP%</code>.\n\nThe [[DR-DOS]] family supports a number of additional ''standard environment variables''<!-- DR-DOS term --> including:\n\n;{{anchor|%BETA%}}<code>%BETA%</code>: This variable contains an optional message displayed by some versions (including [[DR DOS 3.41]]<!-- not supported by DR DOS 3.31-3.40 -->) of <code>COMMAND.COM</code> at the startup of secondary shells.<ref name=\"Paul_2002_CLS\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|%DRDOSCFG%|%NWDOSCFG%|%OPENDOSCFG%}}<code>%DRDOSCFG%</code>/<code>%NWDOSCFG%</code>/<code>%OPENDOSCFG%</code>: This variable contains the directory<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER\"/> (without trailing \"<code>\\</code>\") where to search for <code>.INI</code> and <code>.CFG</code> configuration files (that is, DR-DOS application specific files like <code>TASKMGR.INI</code>, <code>TASKMAX.INI</code>, <code>[[VIEWMAX.INI]]</code>, <code>FASTBACK.CFG</code> etc., class specific files like <code>COLORS.INI</code>, or global files like <code>[[DRDOS.INI]]</code>, <code>[[NWDOS.INI]]</code>, <code>[[OPENDOS.INI]]</code>, or <code>[[DOS.INI]]</code>), as used by the <code>INSTALL</code> and <code>SETUP</code> commands and various DR-DOS programs like <code>DISKOPT</code>, <code>DOSBOOK</code>, <code>EDIT</code>, <code>FBX</code>, <code>FILELINK</code>, <code>LOCK</code>, <code>SECURITY.OVL</code>/<code>NWLOGIN.EXE</code>, <code>SERNO</code>, <code>TASKMAX</code>, <code>TASKMGR</code>, <code>[[VIEWMAX]]</code>, or <code>UNDELETE</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> It must not contain [[long filename]]s.\n\n;{{anchor|%DRCOMSPEC%}}<code>%DRCOMSPEC%</code>: This variable optionally holds an alternative path to the command processor taking precedence over the path defined in the <code>%COMSPEC%</code> variable, optionally including file and directory passwords.

Its uses include storing of [[Theme (computing)|desktop themes]], [[Windows error reporting]], caching and profiles of web browsers.\n\n;{{anchor|ComSpec|COMSPEC}}<code>%[[ComSpec]]%</code><!-- mixed case for CMD under XP -->/<code>%[[COMSPEC]]%</code>:The <code>%ComSpec%</code> variable contains the full path to the command processor; on the Windows NT family of operating systems, this is [[cmd.exe]], while on [[Windows 9x]], <code>%COMSPEC%</code> is [[COMMAND.COM]].\n\n;{{anchor|OS}}<code>%OS%</code>:The <code>%OS%</code> variable contains a symbolic name of the operating system family to distinguish between differing feature sets in [[batchjob]]s. It resembles an identically named environment variable <code>[[#%OS%|%OS%]]</code> found in all DOS-related operating systems of [[Digital Research]]-origin like Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, REAL/32, DOS Plus, DR DOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS. <code>%OS%</code> always holds the string \"<code>Windows_NT</code>\" on the [[Windows NT family]].<ref name=\"Ten_XP\"/>\n\n;{{anchor|PATH}}<code>%PATH%</code><!-- all-uppercase at least under XP -->: This variable contains a semicolon-delimited (do not put spaces in between) list of directories in which the command interpreter will search for an executable file that matches the given command. Environment variables that represent paths may be nested within the <code>%PATH%</code> variable, but only at one level of indirection. If this sub-path environment variable itself contains an environment variable representing a path, <code>%PATH%</code> will not expand properly in the variable substitution. Equivalent to the [[Unix]] <code>[[#$PATH|$PATH]]</code> variable.\n\n;{{anchor|ProgramFiles|ProgramFiles(x86)|ProgramW6432}}<code>%ProgramFiles%</code>, <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%</code>, <code>%ProgramW6432%</code>: The <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> variable points to the ''Program Files'' directory, which stores all the installed programs of Windows and others. The default on English-language systems is \"<code>C:\\Program Files</code>\". In 64-bit editions of Windows (XP, 2003, Vista), there are also <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%</code>, which defaults to \"<code>C:\\Program Files (x86)</code>\", and <code>%ProgramW6432%</code>, which defaults to \"<code>C:\\Program Files</code>\". The <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> itself depends on whether the process requesting the environment variable is itself 32-bit or 64-bit (this is caused by [[WoW64|Windows-on-Windows 64-bit]] redirection).\n\n;{{anchor|CommonProgramFiles}}<code>%CommonProgramFiles%</code>: This variable points to the ''Common Files'' directory. The default is \"<code>C:\\Program Files\\Common Files</code>\" in the English version of Windows.\n\n;{{anchor|SystemDrive}}<code>%SystemDrive%</code>: The <code>%SystemDrive%</code> variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the drive upon which the system directory was placed. The value of <code>%SystemDrive%</code> is in most cases \"<code>C:</code>\".\n\n;{{anchor|SystemRoot}}<code>%SystemRoot%</code>:The <code>%SystemRoot%</code> variable is a special system-wide environment variable found on the Windows NT family of operating systems. Its value is the location of the system directory, including the drive and path. The drive is the same as <code>%SystemDrive%</code> and the default path on a clean installation depends upon the version of the operating system. By default:\n:* [[Windows XP]] and newer versions use \"<code>\\WINDOWS</code>\".\n:* [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows NT 4.0|NT 4.0]] and [[Windows NT 3.1|NT 3.1]] use \"<code>\\WINNT</code>\".\n:* [[Windows NT 3.5]] and [[Windows NT 3.51|NT 3.51]] uses \"<code>\\WINNT35</code>\".\n:* [[Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server]] uses \"<code>\\WTSRV</code>\".\n\n;{{anchor|windir}}<code>%windir%</code><!-- all-lowercase at least under Windows 95/98/98SE and Windows XP -->:This variable points to the ''Windows'' directory. (On the Windows NT family of operating systems, it is identical to the <code>%SystemRoot%</code> variable). [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows ME]] are, by default, installed in \"<code>C:\\Windows</code>\". For other versions of Windows, see the <code>%SystemRoot%</code> entry above.\n\n''User management variables''{{citation needed|date=August 2014|reason=Is this an official name used in Microsoft literature?

As a general rule, these variables do not refer to critical system resources or locations that are necessary for the OS to run.\n\n;{{anchor|ALLUSERSPROFILE|PROGRAMDATA}}<code>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%</code><!-- all-uppercase at least under XP --> (<code>%PROGRAMDATA%</code> since Windows Vista): This variable expands to the full path to the ''All Users'' profile directory. This profile contains resources and settings that are used by all system accounts. [[Shortcut (computing)|Shortcut]] links copied to the ''All Users''\\' ''Start menu'' or ''Desktop'' directories will appear in every user's ''Start menu'' or ''[[Desktop metaphor|Desktop]]'', respectively.\n\n;{{anchor|USERDOMAIN}}<code>%USERDOMAIN%</code><!-- all-uppercase at least under XP -->: The name of the ''[[Workgroup (computer networking)|Workgroup]]'' or ''[[Windows Server domain|Windows Domain]]'' to which the current user belongs. The related variable, <code>%LOGONSERVER%</code>, holds the [[hostname]] of the server that authenticated the current user's login credentials (name and password). For home PCs and PCs in a workgroup, the authenticating server is usually the PC itself. For PCs in a Windows domain, the authenticating server is a [[domain controller]] (a primary domain controller, or PDC, in Windows NT 4-based domains).\n\n;{{anchor|USERPROFILE}}<code>%USERPROFILE%</code><!-- all-uppercase at least under XP -->: A special system-wide environment variable found on Windows NT and its derivatives. Its value is the location of the current user's profile directory, in which is found that user's HKCU registry hive (<code>NTUSER</code>). Users can also use the <code>%USERNAME%</code> variable to determine the active users login identification.\n\n''Optional System variables''{{citation needed|date=August 2014|reason=Is this an official name used in Microsoft literature? If not, we should not italicize it and use the official name instead.}} are not explicitly specified by default but can be used to modify the default behavior of certain built-in console commands.  These variables also do not need to be explicitly specified as command line arguments.\n\n==== Default values ====\nThe following tables shows typical default values of certain environment variables under English versions of Windows as they can be retrieved under <code>[[CMD (Windows)|CMD]]</code>.\n\n(Some of these variables are also defined when running <code>COMMAND.COM</code> under Windows, but differ in certain important details: Under <code>COMMAND.COM</code>, the names of environment variable are always uppercased. Some, but not all variables contain short [[8.3 filename|8.3]] rather than [[long file name]]s. While some variables present in the <code>CMD</code> environment are missing, there are also some variables specific to the <code>COMMAND</code> environment.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The returned values represent the status of the system in the moment these variables are queried; that is, reading them multiple times in a row may return different values even within the same command; querying them has no direct effect on the system. Since they are not stored in the environment, they are not listed by [[SET (DOS command)|SET]] and do not exist for external programs to retrieve. If a true environment variable of the same name is defined, it takes precedence over the corresponding variable until the environment variable is deleted again.

See also the similar pseudo-variable <code>[[#%MONTH%|%MONTH%]]</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|%_ROWS%}}<code>%_ROWS%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the current number of screen rows depending on the display mode, f.e. \"<code>25</code>\", \"<code>43</code>\", \"<code>50</code>\", etc. This variable was originally introduced by [[4DOS]],<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> but also became available with <code>COMMAND.COM</code> since DR-DOS 7.02. See a similar environment variable <code>[[#%$LENGTH%|%$LENGTH%]]</code> under DOS Plus.\n\n;{{anchor|%_SECOND%}}<code>%_SECOND%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the seconds of the current time without leading zeros, f.e. \"<code>0</code>\"..\"<code>59</code>\". This variable was originally introduced by [[4DOS]],<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> but also became available with <code>COMMAND.COM</code> since DR-DOS 7.02. See also the similar pseudo-variable <code>[[#%SECOND%|%SECOND%]]</code>.\n\n''System information variables'' supported by DR-DOS <code>COMMAND.COM</code> with networking loaded:\n\n;{{anchor|%LOGIN_NAME%}}<code>%LOGIN_NAME%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the user name. This always worked with <code>[[NETX]]</code>, but it will also work with [[Personal NetWare]]'s [[Open Data-Link Interface|ODI]]/[[Virtual Loadable Module|VLM]]<!-- since Novell DOS 7 Update 14 --> if the current drive is a PNW-mapped drive (otherwise an empty string is returned). See also the similarly named environment variable <code>[[#%LOGINNAME%|%LOGINNAME%]]</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|%P_STATION%}}<code>%P_STATION%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the physical station number in a format \"<code>????????????</code>\". The value depends on the [[MAC address]] of the network adapter, but can be overridden. It resembles an identically named ''identifier variable'' in [[Novell NetWare]] login scripts.\n\n;{{anchor|%STATION%}}<code>%STATION%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the logical station number starting with \"<code>1</code>\" for the first client. The numbers are assigned by the file server and remain static for as long as the [[IPX]] connection remains established. It resembles an identically named ''identifier variable'' in [[Novell NetWare]] login scripts.\n\n;{{anchor|%FULL_NAME%}}<code>%FULL_NAME%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the full name of the logged in user, if available. It resembles an identically named ''identifier variable'' in [[Novell NetWare]] login scripts. See also the related pseudo-variable <code>[[#%LOGIN_NAME%|%LOGIN_NAME%]]</code>.\n\n==={{anchor|WIN-PSEUDOENV}}Windows ===\n''Dynamic environment variables'' (also named ''internal variables'' or ''system information variables'' under DOS) are pseudo-environment variables supported by <code>[[CMD (Windows)|CMD]]</code> when command-line extensions are enabled, and they expand to various discrete values whenever queried, that is, their values can change when queried multiple times even within the same command. While they can be used in batch jobs and at the prompt, they are not stored in the environment. Consequently, they are neither listed by <code>SET</code> nor do they exist for external programs to read. They are not case-sensitive.\n\nIndirectly, they are also supported under Windows' <code>COMMAND.COM</code>, which has been modified to internally call <code>CMD.EXE</code> to execute the commands.<!-- see ECHO %CMDCMDLINE% under COMMAND.COM -->\n\n;{{anchor|CD}}<code>%CD%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the current directory equivalent to the output of the command <code>[[cd (command)|CD]]</code> when called without arguments. While a long filename can be returned under <code>CMD.EXE</code> depending on the current directory, the fact that the current directory will always be in [[8.3 filename|8.3]] format under <code>COMMAND.COM</code> will cause it to return a short filename under <code>COMMAND.COM</code>, even when <code>COMMAND</code> internally calls <code>CMD</code>.\n\n;{{anchor|CMDCMDLINE}}<code>%CMDCMDLINE%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the original startup parameters of <code>[[CMD.EXE]]</code>, f.e. \"<code>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe</code>\". Under Windows' <code>COMMAND.COM</code>, this may return something like \"<code>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c ...</code>\" due to the fact that <code>COMMAND.COM</code> calls <code>CMD.EXE</code> internally.\n\n;{{anchor|CMDEXTVERSION}}<code>%CMDEXTVERSION%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the version of the command-line extensions of <code>[[CMD.EXE]]</code>, if enabled (e.g. \"<code>1</code>\" under [[Windows NT]], \"<code>2</code>\" under [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]]).\n\n;{{anchor|DATE}}<code>%DATE%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the current date. The date is displayed according to the current user's [[Calendar date|date format]] preferences.\n\n;{{anchor|ERRORLEVEL}}<code>%ERRORLEVEL%</code>: This pseudo-variable expands to the last set error level, a value between \"<code>0</code>\" and \"<code>255</code>\" (without leading zeros).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\"/><ref name=\"Allen_2005\"/><ref name=\"FD_2003_Errorlevel\"/> External commands and some internal commands set error levels upon execution. See also the identically named pseudo-variable <code>[[#%ERRORLEVEL%|%ERRORLEVEL%]]</code> under DR-DOS and the <code>[[IF ERRORLEVEL (Windows command)|IF ERRORLEVEL]]</code> command.\n\n;{{anchor|RANDOM}}<code>%RANDOM%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns a random number between \"<code>0</code>\" and \"<code>32767</code>\".\n\n;{{anchor|TIME}}<code>%TIME%</code>: This pseudo-variable returns the current time. The time is displayed according to the current user's time format preferences. If the <code>%TIME%</code> and <code>[[#DATE|%DATE%]]</code> variables are both used, it is important to read them both in this particular order in rapid succession in order to avoid midnight-rollover problems.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Variable (computer science)]]\n* [[List of Unix commands]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Special folder]]\n* [[Modules Environment]]\n* [[PWB shell]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_CMDLINE\">[[4DOS]] and [[MS-DOS 7.0]] set the length to 127 and insert [[ASCII 13|ASCII-13]] at this position, but [[Borland]] libraries set the length to the invalid value of 128 and do not insert an ASCII-13.
