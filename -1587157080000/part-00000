It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

a [[light rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, that is owned and operated by [[TriMet]]. It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

''N.B''. The title in English is at the head of the Ukrainian title.\n\n==[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Hymnals]]==\nThe official sacred music of most of the Roman Catholic Church (specifically, the [[Roman Rite]]) is in the form of [[Gregorian chant]], and appears in the [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Gradual]].  The Missal contains all that is to be sung during Mass by the priest at the altar, while the [[Gradual]] contains all the music sung by the choir.   The standard [[Roman Gradual]] contains complex Gregorian Chant while the ''Graduale Simplex'' substitutes easier Gregorian chants.  All of these are in Latin, and are published for use throughout most of the Latin Rite (the vast majority of Roman Catholic parishes).\n\nOf Eastern Catholic rites, several of these have hymnals and service books translated in whole or in part into English.  The Byzantine Rite Catholics generally use the same music as the Eastern Orthodox, although some specific Catholic translations of some hymn books into English do exist.  All of the Byzantine Rite churches, and their Eastern Orthodox counterparts, use essentially the same lyrics in their hymns; the primary difference between different Byzantine Rite Catholic churches, such as between [[Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Melkite Catholic Church]] of Antioch, is in the form of the music used.  The churches of the [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] ethnic group, which following the Union of Brest became [[Eastern Catholics]] developed a form of congregational singing known as [[Prostopinije]]; recently, many Rusyns in the United States and central Europe have rejoined the Eastern Orthodox church, but Prostopinije remains in use by both groups of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage, and has been adapted for use in both traditional and modern English.\n\nOf the other Eastern Catholic Rites, the hymnals and service books of the [[Maronites]] have been translated into English, however, for other Eastern Catholic arites, often only the liturgy of the Mass has been translated into English, frequently without seasonal propers.\n\nThe Latin Rite contains three other liturgical traditions still in use: the subtly different Rite of Braga, which is mostly like the [[Tridentine Mass]] but differing in a few minor points, historically used in Portugal before the introduction of the Novus Ordo Mossae, and the substantially different [[Ambrosian Rite]], used by most Catholic parishes in Milan and some adjoining regions, and the [[Mozarabic Rite]], which is also very different from the [[Roman Rite]]; at one time it was the standard liturgy throughout most of Spain during the period of Moorish occupation; later, its use dwindled, and it is now celebrated daily in a single chapel in the [[Toledo Cathedral]] built especially for that purpose; it sees very limited use elsewhere.   These rites have only partially been translated into English, and are never celebrated in English, the diaspora from their locales having adopted the [[Roman Rite]].\n\nThere are also several monastic rites slightly different from the old [[Tridentine Mass]], such as the [[Dominican Rite]] and the [[Carthusian Rite]].  The latter remains in use, exclusively in Latin; the former was translated entirely into English, but is always celebrated in Latin; its use has become rare, but it is still celebrated on occasion.  There exist official English translations of the [[Missal]] and [[Breviary]] of the Dominican Rite, but not of the other distinctive monastic usages.\n\nIt has been the practice to publish hymnals of songs in the vernacular language for more than 400 years, and many of these now contain some Latin Gregorian chants.

[[Byzantine Chant]] is the original musical tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but this developed into a large number of regional variations, including the tonal, polyphonic four-part harmony of the Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian churches, and the three part melodies of the [[Church of Georgia]].<ref>The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity; the Oxford History of Christian Worship</ref>\n\nAll of the Eastern Orthodox and [[Byzantine Catholic]] churches share a common set of hymnals, which provide the basic text for the hymns.  The Octoechos contains the hymns sung in each of the eight tones, used throughout most of the year; the Triodion contains the special hymns and liturgical propers of [[Lent]] and [[Holy Week]], the Pentecostarion, also known as the Flowery Triodion, contains the equivalent proper hymns for Pascha ([[Easter]]), [[Brightweek]], and the period of time lasting through the liturgical season generally known as [[Eastertide]] in the West, including the feast of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], [[Pentecost]] and culminating on the first Sunday after Pentecost, All Saints Day (according to the Byzantine liturgical calendar.<ref>The Orthodox Church, by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware</ref>\n\nThe [[Menaion]] contains the hymns for various holidays and feasts throughout the year.  Variants of it include the [[Festal Menaion]], containing only the most important feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos, the General Menaion, which provides abstract services for particular classes of saint, and the Monthly Menaion, a twelve volume set, all of which has been translated into English, containing all the proper hymns (canons, troparia, kontakia) for the feast says of individual saints throughout the year.   Lastly, the [[Irmologion]], not specifically translated into English but included in other volumes, such as some editions of the Octoechos and Pentecostarion, contains the Irmoi, a standard set of responsaries sung during the canons at Matins.<ref>The Festal Menaion, translated by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware and Mother Mary</ref>\n\nAll of these works aside from the [[Irmologion]] exist in English translations, in various forms, including anthologies.  One of the oldest and most comprehensive is The Divine Prayers and Services of the Orthodox Church, compiled by Fr. Seraphim Nassar, which contains substantial excerpts from the Octoechos, the Menaion, the Triodion and the Pentecostarion.\n\n==[[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox hymnals]]==\n\nLike the Byzantine Rite, the [[West Syriac Rite]] uses an eight mode system of chant similar to [[Byzantine Chant]] and [[Gregorian Chant]], however, traditionally this was not notated, but rather, the melodies were passed down via oral tradition.  The principal hymnal of the Syriac Orthodox Church is the Beth Gazo (\"Treasury\"); proper hymns for various feasts are also found in the books of the liturgy, the Shi'mo, or Divine Office, and the Fanqitho, which replaces the Shi'mo in Great Lent, Holy Week, Pascha and during major feasts throughout the church year.   Of these, only the book of the Liturgy containing the Anaphoras in various forms and the Shi'mo, have been translated into English.<ref>Margoneetho: Shriac Orthodox Resources</ref>\n\nThe [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Rite]] also lacks a system of musical notation; its system of chant, Tasbeha, is somewhat less complex than West Syriac Chant; it is not based on eight modes, but rather a few sets of melodies for use on different occasions; it is passed down primarily as oral tradition, and certain portions of it, for example the chanting of the priests, rely on improvization based on the use of standard musical phrases.  The Coptic [[Euchologion]] contains the hymns of the Divine Liturgy, whereas the books of the [[Annual Psalmody]] and the [[Khiak Psalmody]] contain the hymns of the divine office, the latter specifically for the season of Advent.  There is also a book of offices for Holy Week, and various books containing special services such as funerals, marriages and ordinations, all of which have been translated into English.   There also exist trilingual hymnals containing the [[Divine Liturgy of St. Basil]] set to Western notation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity</ref>\n\nIn contrast, both the [[Armenian Rite]] and [[Ethiopian Rite]] make use of musical notation, which in the case of the Ethiopian church is ancient, dating back to the 6th century; however, these churches serve their liturgies exclusively in [[Classical Armenian]] and [[Ge'ez]] respectively, and consequently, very little of their hymnals or other service books have been translated into English.  The hymnals and service books of the Ethiopian church are particularly obscure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==[[Assyrian Church of the East|Hymnals of the Church of the East]]==\n\nThe [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Ancient Church of the East]], the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and the [[Syro Malabar Catholic Church]] use the [[East Syriac Rite]], which like the [[West Syriac Rite]] lacks a system of musical notation and is instead passed down through oral tradition; it makes use of the following hymnals:  the \"Turgama\" (Interpretation), containing hymns sung by deacons during the liturgy (our Graduals and Sequences), the David (Dawidha = Psalter), \"Khudhra\" (= \"cycle\", containing antiphons, [[responsory|responsories]], hymns, and collects for all Sundays), \"Kash K\u00f5l\" (= \"Collection of all\"; the same chants for week-days), \"Kdham u-Wathar\" (= \"Before and after\"; certain prayers, psalms, and collects most often used, from the other books), \"Gezza\" (\"Treasury\", services for feast-days), Abu-Halim (the name of the compiler, containing collects for the end of the Nocturns on Sundays), \"Bautha d'Ninwaie\" (= \"Prayer of the Ninevites\", a collection of hymns ascribed to St. Ephraem, used in Lent). The Baptism Office (\"Taksa d'Amadha\") is generally bound up with the Liturgies. The \"Taksa d'Siamidha\" has the ordination services. The \"Taksa d'Husaia\" contains the office for Penance, the \"Kthawa d'Burrakha\" is the marriage service, the \"Kahneita\", the burial of clergy, the \"Annidha\" that of laymen. Lastly the \"Khamis\" and \"Warda\" are further collections of hymns (see Badger, \"The Nestorians and their Rituals\", London, 1852, II, 16-25). Naturally not every church possesses this varied collection of books, and most have not been translated into English.  Nonetheless, there are 19th century translations available of the Divine Liturgy and the Divine Office.<ref>1911 Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hymnals}}\n[[Category:Hymnals| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of books by type]]\n[[Category:Christian music lists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{redirect|Chalice Hymnal|the album by Grails|Chalice Hymnal (album)}}\n[[Hymnals]], also called hymnbooks (or hymn books) and occasionally hymnaries, are books of [[hymn]]s sung by religious congregations.

The title in English is at the head of the Ukrainian title.\n\n==[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Hymnals]]==\nThe official sacred music of most of the Roman Catholic Church (specifically, the [[Roman Rite]]) is in the form of [[Gregorian chant]], and appears in the [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Gradual]].  The Missal contains all that is to be sung during Mass by the priest at the altar, while the [[Gradual]] contains all the music sung by the choir.   The standard [[Roman Gradual]] contains complex Gregorian Chant while the ''Graduale Simplex'' substitutes easier Gregorian chants.  All of these are in Latin, and are published for use throughout most of the Latin Rite (the vast majority of Roman Catholic parishes).\n\nOf Eastern Catholic rites, several of these have hymnals and service books translated in whole or in part into English.  The Byzantine Rite Catholics generally use the same music as the Eastern Orthodox, although some specific Catholic translations of some hymn books into English do exist.  All of the Byzantine Rite churches, and their Eastern Orthodox counterparts, use essentially the same lyrics in their hymns; the primary difference between different Byzantine Rite Catholic churches, such as between [[Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Melkite Catholic Church]] of Antioch, is in the form of the music used.  The churches of the [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] ethnic group, which following the Union of Brest became [[Eastern Catholics]] developed a form of congregational singing known as [[Prostopinije]]; recently, many Rusyns in the United States and central Europe have rejoined the Eastern Orthodox church, but Prostopinije remains in use by both groups of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage, and has been adapted for use in both traditional and modern English.\n\nOf the other Eastern Catholic Rites, the hymnals and service books of the [[Maronites]] have been translated into English, however, for other Eastern Catholic arites, often only the liturgy of the Mass has been translated into English, frequently without seasonal propers.\n\nThe Latin Rite contains three other liturgical traditions still in use: the subtly different Rite of Braga, which is mostly like the [[Tridentine Mass]] but differing in a few minor points, historically used in Portugal before the introduction of the Novus Ordo Mossae, and the substantially different [[Ambrosian Rite]], used by most Catholic parishes in Milan and some adjoining regions, and the [[Mozarabic Rite]], which is also very different from the [[Roman Rite]]; at one time it was the standard liturgy throughout most of Spain during the period of Moorish occupation; later, its use dwindled, and it is now celebrated daily in a single chapel in the [[Toledo Cathedral]] built especially for that purpose; it sees very limited use elsewhere.   These rites have only partially been translated into English, and are never celebrated in English, the diaspora from their locales having adopted the [[Roman Rite]].\n\nThere are also several monastic rites slightly different from the old [[Tridentine Mass]], such as the [[Dominican Rite]] and the [[Carthusian Rite]].  The latter remains in use, exclusively in Latin; the former was translated entirely into English, but is always celebrated in Latin; its use has become rare, but it is still celebrated on occasion.  There exist official English translations of the [[Missal]] and [[Breviary]] of the Dominican Rite, but not of the other distinctive monastic usages.\n\nIt has been the practice to publish hymnals of songs in the vernacular language for more than 400 years, and many of these now contain some Latin Gregorian chants.  They include the following:\n\n===[[Catholic Church in Australia]]===\n*Catholic Worship Book II (Official music resource of the Australian Catholic Church)\n*Gather Australia\n*As One Voice\n*Together in Song\n*New Living Parish Hymn Book\n\n===[[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]], [[Ottawa]]===\n*Catholic Book of Worship (three editions) (1972,1980,1994)\n\n===[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Port of Spain]]===\n*Caribbean Worship and Song (three editions) (2012)\n\n===Hymnals from third-party publishers in use in the Catholic Church===\n\n====Portland, OR: [[Oregon Catholic Press|OCP]] Publications====\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*Journeysongs\n**{{Cite |title = Journeysongs.| date = 1994|oclc=31789925}}\n**{{Cite | isbn = 978-1-57992-112-5 | title = Journeysongs.| edition=  2nd}}\n**{{Cite | isbn = 978-1-57992-151-4| edition= 3rd| date = 2012|title=Journeysongs}}\n*[[Glory and Praise|Glory & Praise]] Volumes 1,2, & 3 (any one or combination thereof, softbound or hardbound)\n*[[Glory and Praise|Glory & Praise]] (Classic Edition, 2nd Edition, Comprehensive, Young People's Edition)\n*{{Cite| isbn = 978-1-57992-122-4|  title = One Faith, Una Voz| date = 2005}} (bilingual)\n{{Col-break}}\n*Heritage Missal (Published Yearly, {{ISSN|1527-6333}})\n*Today's Missal (Published Yearly, {{ISSN|0199-8803}})\n*Breaking Bread (Published Yearly,  {{ISSN|1939-2575}})\n*{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-57992-007-4 | title = Spirit & song: a seeker's guide for liturgy and prayer| date = 1999}}\n*{{Cite|isbn = 978-1-57992-129-3 | title = Spirit & song 2: more resources for prayer & worship| date = 2005}}\n*{{Cite| last1 = Catholic Church| last2 = United States Conference of Catholic Bishops| last3 = Committee on Divine Worship| title = Spirit & song.| date = 2013|edition= 2nd|ref=none}}\n*Rise Up and Sing (2 editions)\n*{{Cite| isbn = 978-1-57992-139-2| title = Never Too Young: Spirit & Song for Young People|  date = 2007}}\n*Flor y Canto (Spanish-language hymns)\n{{col-end}}\n\n====Chicago, IL: [[GIA Publications]]====\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*Gather Series\n:*Gather (1988)\n:*Gather II (1992)\n:*Gather Comprehensive (1994)\n:*Gather Comprehensive, 2nd ed.

[[Byzantine Chant]] is the original musical tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but this developed into a large number of regional variations, including the tonal, polyphonic four-part harmony of the Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian churches, and the three part melodies of the [[Church of Georgia]].<ref>The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity; the Oxford History of Christian Worship</ref>\n\nAll of the Eastern Orthodox and [[Byzantine Catholic]] churches share a common set of hymnals, which provide the basic text for the hymns.  The Octoechos contains the hymns sung in each of the eight tones, used throughout most of the year; the Triodion contains the special hymns and liturgical propers of [[Lent]] and [[Holy Week]], the Pentecostarion, also known as the Flowery Triodion, contains the equivalent proper hymns for Pascha ([[Easter]]), [[Brightweek]], and the period of time lasting through the liturgical season generally known as [[Eastertide]] in the West, including the feast of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], [[Pentecost]] and culminating on the first Sunday after Pentecost, All Saints Day (according to the Byzantine liturgical calendar.<ref>The Orthodox Church, by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware</ref>\n\nThe [[Menaion]] contains the hymns for various holidays and feasts throughout the year.  Variants of it include the [[Festal Menaion]], containing only the most important feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos, the General Menaion, which provides abstract services for particular classes of saint, and the Monthly Menaion, a twelve volume set, all of which has been translated into English, containing all the proper hymns (canons, troparia, kontakia) for the feast says of individual saints throughout the year.   Lastly, the [[Irmologion]], not specifically translated into English but included in other volumes, such as some editions of the Octoechos and Pentecostarion, contains the Irmoi, a standard set of responsaries sung during the canons at Matins.<ref>The Festal Menaion, translated by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware and Mother Mary</ref>\n\nAll of these works aside from the [[Irmologion]] exist in English translations, in various forms, including anthologies.  One of the oldest and most comprehensive is The Divine Prayers and Services of the Orthodox Church, compiled by Fr. Seraphim Nassar, which contains substantial excerpts from the Octoechos, the Menaion, the Triodion and the Pentecostarion.\n\n==[[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox hymnals]]==\n\nLike the Byzantine Rite, the [[West Syriac Rite]] uses an eight mode system of chant similar to [[Byzantine Chant]] and [[Gregorian Chant]], however, traditionally this was not notated, but rather, the melodies were passed down via oral tradition.  The principal hymnal of the Syriac Orthodox Church is the Beth Gazo (\"Treasury\"); proper hymns for various feasts are also found in the books of the liturgy, the Shi'mo, or Divine Office, and the Fanqitho, which replaces the Shi'mo in Great Lent, Holy Week, Pascha and during major feasts throughout the church year.   Of these, only the book of the Liturgy containing the Anaphoras in various forms and the Shi'mo, have been translated into English.<ref>Margoneetho: Shriac Orthodox Resources</ref>\n\nThe [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Rite]] also lacks a system of musical notation; its system of chant, Tasbeha, is somewhat less complex than West Syriac Chant; it is not based on eight modes, but rather a few sets of melodies for use on different occasions; it is passed down primarily as oral tradition, and certain portions of it, for example the chanting of the priests, rely on improvization based on the use of standard musical phrases.  The Coptic [[Euchologion]] contains the hymns of the Divine Liturgy, whereas the books of the [[Annual Psalmody]] and the [[Khiak Psalmody]] contain the hymns of the divine office, the latter specifically for the season of Advent.  There is also a book of offices for Holy Week, and various books containing special services such as funerals, marriages and ordinations, all of which have been translated into English.   There also exist trilingual hymnals containing the [[Divine Liturgy of St. Basil]] set to Western notation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity</ref>\n\nIn contrast, both the [[Armenian Rite]] and [[Ethiopian Rite]] make use of musical notation, which in the case of the Ethiopian church is ancient, dating back to the 6th century; however, these churches serve their liturgies exclusively in [[Classical Armenian]] and [[Ge'ez]] respectively, and consequently, very little of their hymnals or other service books have been translated into English.  The hymnals and service books of the Ethiopian church are particularly obscure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==[[Assyrian Church of the East|Hymnals of the Church of the East]]==\n\nThe [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Ancient Church of the East]], the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and the [[Syro Malabar Catholic Church]] use the [[East Syriac Rite]], which like the [[West Syriac Rite]] lacks a system of musical notation and is instead passed down through oral tradition; it makes use of the following hymnals:  the \"Turgama\" (Interpretation), containing hymns sung by deacons during the liturgy (our Graduals and Sequences), the David (Dawidha = Psalter), \"Khudhra\" (= \"cycle\", containing antiphons, [[responsory|responsories]], hymns, and collects for all Sundays), \"Kash K\u00f5l\" (= \"Collection of all\"; the same chants for week-days), \"Kdham u-Wathar\" (= \"Before and after\"; certain prayers, psalms, and collects most often used, from the other books), \"Gezza\" (\"Treasury\", services for feast-days), Abu-Halim (the name of the compiler, containing collects for the end of the Nocturns on Sundays), \"Bautha d'Ninwaie\" (= \"Prayer of the Ninevites\", a collection of hymns ascribed to St. Ephraem, used in Lent). The Baptism Office (\"Taksa d'Amadha\") is generally bound up with the Liturgies. The \"Taksa d'Siamidha\" has the ordination services. The \"Taksa d'Husaia\" contains the office for Penance, the \"Kthawa d'Burrakha\" is the marriage service, the \"Kahneita\", the burial of clergy, the \"Annidha\" that of laymen. Lastly the \"Khamis\" and \"Warda\" are further collections of hymns (see Badger, \"The Nestorians and their Rituals\", London, 1852, II, 16-25).

Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]) not only to give [[speculative fiction]] a second look, but to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the [[Nebula Award]] for science fiction and fantasy.

When his wife graduated from Clarke in 1979, he resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, they moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in 1979, which they had \"fallen in love with\" after a visit the year before on their way to the [[36th World Science Fiction Convention|worldcon in Phoenix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/george-r-r-martin-interview|title=George R.R.

In 1975 his story \"...for a single yesterday\" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in ''[[Epoch (anthology)|Epoch]]'', a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, ''[[Dying of the Light (1977 novel)|Dying of the Light]]'', was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-rolling-stone-interview-20140613|title=George R.R.

The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed [[Bobby Fischer]]'s victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When the chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/song-of-ice-and-fire-author-george-rr-martin-on-success-chess-and-the-wrath-of-superfans-9652448.html|title=George RR Martin on success, chess and the wrath of superfans|website=independent.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgerrmartin.com/life/|title=Life & Times of George R.R.

Martin considered ''[[Sandkings (novelette)|Sandkings]]'' (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella ''[[Nightflyers]]'' (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, ''[[Nightflyers (film)|Nightflyers]]'', with a screenplay co-written by Martin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrm.livejournal.com/555986.html|title=The NIGHTFLYER Flies Again|last=grrm|date=November 27, 2017|website=livejournal.com}}</ref> Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget.<ref name=\"NPR2012\">{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/15/161142894/thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-plays-not-my-job?ps=view&ec=mostpopular | title='Thrones' Author George R.R.

Unlike traditional vampire novels, in ''Fevre Dream'' vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised ''Fevre Dream'' for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: \"This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time\".<ref name=\"D'Amassa pages 388-390\">D'Amassa, Don \"Martin, George\" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 1997 page 390.</ref> Martin followed up ''Fevre Dream'' with another [[horror novel]], ''[[The Armageddon Rag]]'' (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of ''The Armageddon Rag'' \"essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time\", he recalled, and made him consider going into [[real estate]] instead.<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/failure-nearly-made-apos-game-143043933.html This failure nearly made 'Game of Thrones' creator George R.R. Martin stop writing and go into real estate]</ref>\n\nIn 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like [[Solomon Kane]], [[Elric]], [[Nicholas van Rijn]] and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel ''Black and White and Red All Over'', which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of ''The Armageddon Rag'', all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in ''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt ''The Armageddon Rag'' into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.<ref name=\"berwick20120601\">{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 1, 2012 | access-date=June 1, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mp2dODRtZOUC&pg=PT8&dq=fantasy+Moorcock's+Elric+Howard's+Solomon+Kane,+Gray+Mouser+Dominic+Flandry#v=onepage&q=fantasy+Moorcock's+Elric+Howard's+Solomon+Kane,+Gray+Mouser+Dominic+Flandry|title=Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective|first=George R.

After the [[CBS]] series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series [[Max Headroom (TV series)|''Max Headroom'']]. He worked on scripts and created the show's \"Ped Xing\" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.\n\nIn 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in ''[[Portraits of His Children]]''. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author ''[[Wild Cards]]'' book series, which takes place in a [[shared universe]] in which a small slice of post\u2013[[World War II]] humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from [[Tor Books]].

Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The series was renewed shortly after the first episode aired.\n\nThe first season was nominated for 13 [[Emmy Awards]], ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for [[Peter Dinklage]] as Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe first season was also nominated for a 2012 Hugo Award, fantasy and science fiction's oldest award, presented by the [[World Science Fiction Society]] each year at the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon]]; the show went on to win the 2012 Hugo for ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form'', at [[Chicon 7]], the [[70th World Science Fiction Convention]]. Martin took home one of the three Hugo Award trophies awarded in that collaborative category, the other two going to ''Game of Thrones'' show-runners [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B.

The second season was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, including another Supporting Actor nomination for Dinklage. It went on to win six of those Emmys in the Technical Arts categories, which were awarded the week before the regular televised 2012 awards show. The second-season episode \"[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]\", written by Martin, was nominated the following year for the 2013 Hugo Award in the ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form'' category; that episode went on to win the Hugo Award at LoneStarCon 3, the [[71st World Science Fiction Convention]]. In addition to Martin, show-runners Benioff and Weiss (who contributed several scenes to the final screenplay) and episode director Neil Marshal (who expanded the scope of the episode on set) received Hugo statuettes.\n\nSeasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen [[Emmy Awards]], including Outstanding Drama Series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-hbo-marathon-year-end-1201946918/ |title='Game of Thrones': Year-End Marathon to Air on HBO |last=Yee |first=Lawrence |date=December 21, 2016 |website=Variety |publisher=Variety |access-date=December 21, 2016 |quote=It has been nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Drama every season it's aired, winning the award the last two years.

This story has a strong sense of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to [[idealism]]s in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them.

It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.<ref name=\"TMWagner\" /></blockquote>Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. ''Publishers Weekly'' writes of his ongoing epic fantasy ''A Song of Ice and Fire'': \"The complexity of characters such as [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like [[J.

Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent \"heroic knights and chivalry\" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from [[J. R. R.

That same year the enormous success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-rolling-stone-interview-20140613|title=George R.R.

The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed [[Bobby Fischer]]'s victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When the chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/song-of-ice-and-fire-author-george-rr-martin-on-success-chess-and-the-wrath-of-superfans-9652448.html|title=George RR Martin on success, chess and the wrath of superfans|website=independent.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgerrmartin.com/life/|title=Life & Times of George R.R.

Martin considered ''[[Sandkings (novelette)|Sandkings]]'' (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella ''[[Nightflyers]]'' (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, ''[[Nightflyers (film)|Nightflyers]]'', with a screenplay co-written by Martin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrm.livejournal.com/555986.html|title=The NIGHTFLYER Flies Again|last=grrm|date=November 27, 2017|website=livejournal.com}}</ref> Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget.<ref name=\"NPR2012\">{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/15/161142894/thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-plays-not-my-job?ps=view&ec=mostpopular | title='Thrones' Author George R.R.

Unlike traditional vampire novels, in ''Fevre Dream'' vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised ''Fevre Dream'' for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: \"This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time\".<ref name=\"D'Amassa pages 388-390\">D'Amassa, Don \"Martin, George\" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 1997 page 390.</ref> Martin followed up ''Fevre Dream'' with another [[horror novel]], ''[[The Armageddon Rag]]'' (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of ''The Armageddon Rag'' \"essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time\", he recalled, and made him consider going into [[real estate]] instead.<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/failure-nearly-made-apos-game-143043933.html This failure nearly made 'Game of Thrones' creator George R.R. Martin stop writing and go into real estate]</ref>\n\nIn 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like [[Solomon Kane]], [[Elric]], [[Nicholas van Rijn]] and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel ''Black and White and Red All Over'', which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of ''The Armageddon Rag'', all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in ''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt ''The Armageddon Rag'' into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.<ref name=\"berwick20120601\">{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 1, 2012 | access-date=June 1, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mp2dODRtZOUC&pg=PT8&dq=fantasy+Moorcock's+Elric+Howard's+Solomon+Kane,+Gray+Mouser+Dominic+Flandry#v=onepage&q=fantasy+Moorcock's+Elric+Howard's+Solomon+Kane,+Gray+Mouser+Dominic+Flandry|title=Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective|first=George R.

After the [[CBS]] series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series [[Max Headroom (TV series)|''Max Headroom'']]. He worked on scripts and created the show's \"Ped Xing\" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.\n\nIn 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in ''[[Portraits of His Children]]''. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author ''[[Wild Cards]]'' book series, which takes place in a [[shared universe]] in which a small slice of post\u2013[[World War II]] humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from [[Tor Books]].

His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to [[idealism]]s in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them.

It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.<ref name=\"TMWagner\" /></blockquote>Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. ''Publishers Weekly'' writes of his ongoing epic fantasy ''A Song of Ice and Fire'': \"The complexity of characters such as [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like [[J.
