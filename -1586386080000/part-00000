Both [[defendant]]s instructed [[Richard Rampton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] while Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior counsel. The expert witnesses for the defence included [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] historian [[Richard J. Evans]], [[Christopher Browning]], [[Robert Jan van Pelt]], and [[Peter Longerich]].\n\n[[English defamation law|English libel law]] places the burden of proof on the defendant rather than the plaintiff. [[wikisource:David Irving v. Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt and Penguin won the case]] using the justification defence, namely by demonstrating in court that Lipstadt's accusations against Irving were substantially true and therefore not libelous. The case was argued as a [[bench trial]] before [[Charles Gray (English judge)|Mr Justice Gray]], who produced a written judgment 349 pages long detailing Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of [[World War II]]. ''[[The Times]]'' (April 14, 2000, p.&nbsp;23) said of Lipstadt's victory, \"History has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.\"<ref>[http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/index.html Holocaust Denial On Trial: Holocaust Denial and the 2000 Libel Trial in the U.K.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815102201/http://hdot.org/en/trial/index.html |date=2015-08-15 }}, a project of The Rabbi Donald A.

In Austria, minimizing the atrocities of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] is a crime punishable with up to 10 years' imprisonment. Speaking of Irving, Lipstadt said, \"I am uncomfortable with imprisoning people for speech. Let him go and let him fade from everyone's radar screens ...

Speaking of Nolte in a 2003 interview, Lipstadt stated:\n\n{{quote|Historians such as the German Ernst Nolte are, in some ways, even more dangerous than the deniers. Nolte is an anti-Semite of the first order, who attempts to rehabilitate [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] by saying that he was no worse than [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]; but he is careful not to deny the Holocaust. Holocaust-deniers make Nolte's life more comfortable. They have, with their radical argumentation, pulled the center a little more to their side. Consequently, a less radical extremist, such as Nolte, finds himself closer to the middle ground, which makes him more dangerous.<ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm \"Denial of the Holocaust and Immoral Equivalence\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816010915/http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm |date=2007-08-16 }} ''The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs'' (August 1, 2003).</ref>}}\n\nIn late 2011, Lipstadt attacked American and Israeli politicians for what she called their invocation of the Holocaust for contemporary political purposes, something she thought mangled history.

Both [[defendant]]s instructed [[Richard Rampton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] while Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior counsel. The expert witnesses for the defence included [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] historian [[Richard J. Evans]], [[Christopher Browning]], [[Robert Jan van Pelt]], and [[Peter Longerich]].\n\n[[English defamation law|English libel law]] places the burden of proof on the defendant rather than the plaintiff. [[wikisource:David Irving v. Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt and Penguin won the case]] using the justification defence, namely by demonstrating in court that Lipstadt's accusations against Irving were substantially true and therefore not libelous. The case was argued as a [[bench trial]] before [[Charles Gray (English judge)|Mr Justice Gray]], who produced a written judgment 349 pages long detailing Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of [[World War II]]. ''[[The Times]]'' (April 14, 2000, p.&nbsp;23) said of Lipstadt's victory, \"History has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.\"<ref>[http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/index.html Holocaust Denial On Trial: Holocaust Denial and the 2000 Libel Trial in the U.K.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815102201/http://hdot.org/en/trial/index.html |date=2015-08-15 }}, a project of The Rabbi Donald A.

Speaking of Nolte in a 2003 interview, Lipstadt stated:\n\n{{quote|Historians such as the German Ernst Nolte are, in some ways, even more dangerous than the deniers. Nolte is an anti-Semite of the first order, who attempts to rehabilitate [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] by saying that he was no worse than [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]; but he is careful not to deny the Holocaust. Holocaust-deniers make Nolte's life more comfortable. They have, with their radical argumentation, pulled the center a little more to their side. Consequently, a less radical extremist, such as Nolte, finds himself closer to the middle ground, which makes him more dangerous.<ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm \"Denial of the Holocaust and Immoral Equivalence\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816010915/http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-11.htm |date=2007-08-16 }} ''The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs'' (August 1, 2003).</ref>}}\n\nIn late 2011, Lipstadt attacked American and Israeli politicians for what she called their invocation of the Holocaust for contemporary political purposes, something she thought mangled history.

{"title_page": "Series (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{short description|Infinite sum}}\n{{about|infinite sums|finite sums|Summation}}\n{{Calculus}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''series''' is, roughly speaking, a description of the operation of adding infinitely many quantities, one after the other, to a given starting quantity.<ref>{{cite book |title=Calculus Made Easy |last1=Thompson |first1=Silvanus |authorlink1=Silvanus P.

Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch up with the tortoise.\n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) [[Sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> of [[Term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is, numbers, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like\n: <math>a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots,</math>\nor, using the [[summation sign]],\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i.</math>\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the {{math|''n''}}th '''partial sums''' of the series. That is,\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i  = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.</math>\nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is '''convergent''' or '''summable''', or that the sequence <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the '''sum''' of the series. Otherwise, the series is said to be '''divergent'''.\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbb R</math> of the [[real number]]s or the field <math>\\mathbb C</math> of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form<ref name=\"SW501\">{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}</ref>\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots, </math>\nwhere <math>(a_n)</math> is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms <math>a_0,a_1,\\dots</math> by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n </math> .\n\nIf an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series <math>s=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n,</math> its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is\n:<math>s_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_k.</math>\nBy definition, the series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math> ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.<ref name=\"SW501\" /> In this case, one usually writes\n:<math>L = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n.</math>\nA series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\n===Convergent series===\n[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]\nA series {{math|\u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}</ref> When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^k a_n.</math>\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\n:<math> 1 + \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots+ \\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, \u00bd, \u00bc, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off \u00bd, we still have a piece of length \u00bd unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&nbsp;\u00bc.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>S/2 = \\frac{1+ \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{16} +\\cdots.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>S-S/2 = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 2.</math>\n\nThe idiom can be extended to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in\n\n:<math>x = 0.111\\dots </math>,\n\nencodes the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{10^n}.</math>\n\nSince these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111... can be identified with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 \u00d7 0.111... = 0.999... = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].\n\n==Examples of numerical series==\n{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}\n* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).  Example:\n::<math>1 + {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 8} + {1 \\over 16} + \\cdots=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{1 \\over 2^n}.</math>\n:In general, the geometric series\n::<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty z^n</math>\n:converges [[if and only if]] <math display=\"inline\">|z| < 1</math>.\n* [[Hypergeometric series]]:\n:<math>_rF_s \\left[ \\begin{matrix}a_1, a_2, \\dotsc, a_r \\\\ b_1, b_2, \\dotsc, b_s \\end{matrix}; z \\right] := \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(a_1)_n (a_2)_n \\dotsb (a_r)_n}{(b_1)_n (b_2)_n \\dotsb (b_s)_n \\; n!} z^n</math>\nand their generalizations (such as [[basic hypergeometric series]] and [[elliptic hypergeometric series]]) frequently appear in [[integrable systems]] and [[mathematical physics]].<ref>Gasper, G., Rahman, M. (2004). Basic hypergeometric series. [[Cambridge university press]].</ref>\n* An ''[[arithmetico-geometric series]]'' is a generalization of the geometric series, which has coefficients of the common ratio equal to the terms in an [[arithmetic sequence]].  Example:\n::<math>3 + {5 \\over 2} + {7 \\over 4} + {9 \\over 8} + {11 \\over 16} + \\cdots=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{(3+2n) \\over 2^n}.</math>\n* The ''[[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]'' is the series\n::<math>1 + {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} + {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} + \\cdots = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {1 \\over n}.</math>\n:The harmonic series is [[harmonic series (mathematics)#Divergence|divergent]].\n* An ''[[alternating series]]'' is a series where terms alternate signs.  Examples:\n::<math>1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots =\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {\\left(-1\\right)^{n-1} \\over n}=\\ln(2) \\quad </math> ([[alternating harmonic series]])\n\nand\n\n::<math>-1+\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{1}{9} + \\cdots =\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(-1\\right)^n}{2n-1} = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}</math>\n* The [[harmonic series (mathematics)#P-series|''p''-series]]\n::<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^p}</math>\n:converges if ''p'' > 1 and diverges for ''p'' \u2264 1, which can be shown with the integral criterion described below in [[Series (mathematics)#Convergence tests|convergence tests]]. As a function of ''p'', the sum of this series is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].\n* A [[telescoping series]]\n::<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (b_n-b_{n+1})</math>\n:converges if the [[sequence]] ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to a limit ''L'' as ''n'' goes to infinity. The value of the series is then ''b''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''L''.\n* There are some elementary series whose convergence is not yet known/proven. For example, it is unknown whether the Flint Hills series {{anchor|Flint Hills series|Flint Hills Series}}\n::<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\csc^{2} n}{n^{3}}</math>\n:converges or not. The convergence depends on how well <math>\\pi</math> can be approximated with rational numbers (which is unknown as of yet). More specifically, the values of ''n'' with large numerical contributions to the sum are the numerators of the continued fraction convergents of <math>\\pi</math>, a sequence beginning with 1, 3, 22, 333, 355, 103993, ... {{OEIS|A046947}}.

It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[Linear map|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the [[vector space]] of sequences, denoted \u03a3. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, denoted \u0394. These behave as discrete analogs of [[Integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) has series (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that <math>\\int_0^x 1\\,dt = x.</math>\n\nIn [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].\n\n==Properties of series==\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a<sub>n</sub> (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a<sub>n</sub> (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\n===Non-negative terms===\nWhen ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}</math>\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\n:<math>\\frac1 {n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}, \\quad n \\ge 2,</math>\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].\n\n===Absolute convergence===\n{{Main|Absolute convergence}}\nA series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n</math>\nis said to '''converge absolutely''' if the series of [[absolute value]]s\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left|a_n\\right|</math>\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\n===Conditional convergence===\n{{Main|Conditional convergence}}\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\n:<math>\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \\over n} = 1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to&nbsp;ln&nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&nbsp;''S''.\n\n[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\n:<math>\\sum a_n = \\sum \\lambda_n b_n</math>\n\nwhere the partial sums ''B''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''<sub>0</sub> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''b<sub>n</sub>''}} are bounded, ''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub> has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim \u03bb<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} exists:\n\n:<math>\\sup_N \\Bigl| \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\Bigr| < \\infty, \\ \\ \\sum |\\lambda_{n+1} - \\lambda_n| < \\infty\\ \\text{and} \\ \\lambda_n B_n \\ \\text{converges,}</math>\n\nthen the series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} is convergent.  This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin(n x)}{\\ln n}</math>\n\nwith 0&nbsp;< ''x''&nbsp;< 2\u03c0.  Abel's method consists in writing ''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;= ''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212 ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} to the absolutely convergent series\n\n:<math> \\sum (\\lambda_n - \\lambda_{n+1}) \\, B_n.</math>\n\n===Evaluation of truncation errors===\nThe evaluation of truncation errors is an important procedure in [[numerical analysis]] (especially [[validated numerics]] and [[computer-assisted proof]]).\n====[[Alternating series]]====\nWhen conditions of the [[alternating series test]] is satisfied by <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>, there is an exact error evaluation.<ref>[https://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Calculus-Concepts/section/9.9/ Positive and Negative Terms: Alternating Series]</ref> Set <math>s_n</math> as the partial sum of the given alternating series <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>.

If \u2211|''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;| diverges, and |''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;|&nbsp;\u2265 |''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;| for all sufficiently large ''n''&nbsp;, then \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp; also fails to converge absolutely (though it could still be conditionally convergent, for example, if the ''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp; alternate in sign).\n* Comparison test 2 (see [[Limit comparison test]]): If \u2211''b<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp; is an absolutely convergent series such that |''a<sub>n+1</sub>''&nbsp;/''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;|&nbsp;\u2264 |''b<sub>n+1</sub>''&nbsp;/''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;| for sufficiently large ''n''&nbsp;, then \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp; converges absolutely as well.

When the ratio is less than 1, but not less than a constant less than 1, convergence is possible but this test does not establish it.\n* [[Root test]]: If there exists a constant ''C''&nbsp;< 1 such that |''a''<sub>''n''</sub>|<sup>1/''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2264 ''C'' for all sufficiently large&nbsp;''n'', then \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges absolutely.\n* [[Integral test for convergence|Integral test]]: if ''\u0192''(''x'') is a positive [[monotone decreasing]] function defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>1, \u221e<nowiki>)</nowiki><!--DO NOT \"FIX\" THE \"TYPO\" IN THE FOREGOING.

Such a series converges if the [[sequence]] ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[monotone decreasing]] and converges to&nbsp;0. The converse is in general not true.\n* For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].\n\n==Series of functions==\n{{Main|Function series}}\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n(x)</math>\n\n'''[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]]''' on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums\n:<math>s_N(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)</math>\nconverge to ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e for each ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''E''.\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called '''[[uniform convergence]]'''.  The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''\u0192''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,\n:<math>|s_N(x) - f(x)|</math>\ncan be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''\u0192''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''\u0192'' provided\n:<math>\\int_E \\left|s_N(x)-f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx \\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\n===Power series===\n:{{Main|Power series}}\n\nA '''power series''' is a series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-c)^n.</math>\n\nThe [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\nis the Taylor series of <math>e^x</math> at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.\n\nUnless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\n=== Formal power series ===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example, using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: \u00a7III.2.11.</ref>  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\n===Laurent series===\n{{Main|Laurent series}}\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n x^n.</math>\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\n===Dirichlet series===\n:{{Main|Dirichlet series}}\n\nA [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n^s},</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]].  For example, if all ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the [[Riemann zeta function]]\n\n:<math>\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}.</math>\n\nLike the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in [[analytic number theory]].  Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;> 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on <math>\\mathbf{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}</math>&thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&nbsp;1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].\n\n===Trigonometric series===\n{{Main|Trigonometric series}}\nA series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':\n:<math>\\tfrac12 A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(A_n\\cos nx + B_n \\sin nx\\right).</math>\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.\n\n==History of the theory of infinite series==\n\n===Development of infinite series===\n[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|\u03c0]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].\n\n===Convergence criteria===\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1\\cdot\\gamma}x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\beta(\\beta+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\gamma(\\gamma+1)}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\n[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.\n\n[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]\n:<math>1 + \\frac{m}{1!}x + \\frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of <math>m</math> and <math>x</math>. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]\n(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\n[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been\nstudied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\n===Uniform convergence===\nThe theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847\u201348). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\n===Semi-convergence===\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schl\u00f6milch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]\n\n:<math>F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \\cdots + (x - 1)^n.</math>\n\n[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose \"loi supr\u00eame\" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\n===Fourier series===\n[[Fourier series]] were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\n[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still\nearlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,\nas did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schr\u00f6ter|Schr\u00f6ter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820\u201323) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli|Schl\u00e4fli]], and\n[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],\nKrause, Byerly and [[Paul \u00c9mile Appell|Appell]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Asymptotic series===\n[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge, but they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\n===Divergent series===\n{{Main|Divergent series}}\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman\u2013Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.\n\n===Series in Banach spaces===\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,\n:<math>\\biggl\\|x - \\sum_{n=0}^N x_n\\biggr\\|\\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.\n\n===Summations over arbitrary index sets===\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.<ref>{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref>  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf <math>a:I \\mapsto G</math> is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the \"series\" associated to <math>a</math> is the [[formal sum]] of the elements <math>a(x) \\in G </math> over the index elements <math>x \\in I</math> denoted by the\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in I} a(x).</math>\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers <math>I=\\mathbb{N}</math>, the function <math>a:\\mathbb{N} \\mapsto G</math> is a [[sequence]] denoted by <math>a(n)=a_n</math>. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite <math>\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> as <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots.</math>\n\n====Families of non-negative numbers====\nWhen summing a family {''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}, ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\sup \\Bigl\\{ \\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A \\text{ finite, } A \\subset I\\Bigr\\} \\in [0, +\\infty].</math>\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> 0 is countable.  Indeed, for every ''n''&nbsp;\u2265 1, the set <math> A_n = \\{ i \\in I \\,:\\, a_i > 1/n \\}</math> is finite, because\n\n:<math> \\frac 1 n \\, \\textrm{card}(A_n) \\le \\sum_{i\\in A_n} a_i  \\le \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i < \\infty.</math>\n\nIf ''I''&thinsp; is countably infinite and enumerated as ''I''&nbsp;= {''i''<sub>0</sub>, ''i''<sub>1</sub>,...} then the above defined sum satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} a_{i_k},</math>\n\nprovided the value \u221e is allowed for the sum of the series.\n\nAny sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the [[counting measure]], which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.\n\n====Abelian topological groups====\nLet ''a''&nbsp;: ''I'' \u2192 ''X'', where ''I''&thinsp; is any set and ''X''&thinsp; is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Let ''F''&thinsp; be the collection of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]s of ''I'', with ''F'' viewed as a [[directed set]], [[Partially ordered set|ordered]] under [[inclusion (mathematics)|inclusion]] with [[union (set theory)|union]] as [[join (mathematics)|join]].  Define the sum ''S''&thinsp; of the family ''a'' as the limit\n\n:<math> S = \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\lim \\Bigl\\{\\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A\\in F\\Bigr\\}</math>\n\nif it exists and say that the family ''a'' is unconditionally summable.  Saying that the sum ''S''&thinsp; is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>S - \\sum_{i \\in A} a_i \\in V, \\quad A \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nBecause ''F''&thinsp; is not [[total order|totally ordered]], this is not a [[limit of a sequence]] of partial sums, but rather of a [[net (mathematics)|net]].<ref name=\"Bourbaki\">{{cite book|title=General Topology: Chapters 1\u20134 |first=Nicolas |last=Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64241-1 |pages=261\u2013270}}</ref><ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite book|title=Topology |first=Gustave |last=Choquet |authorlink=Gustave Choquet |year=1966 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-173450-3 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nFor every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a smaller neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; such that ''V''&nbsp;\u2212 ''V''&nbsp;\u2282 ''W''. It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is, for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in A_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in A_2} a_i \\in W, \\quad A_1, A_2 \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nWhen ''X''&thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&thinsp; is complete and ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&nbsp;\u2282 ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a<sub>j</sub>'', ''j''&nbsp;\u2208 ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\nIf a family ''a'' in ''X''&thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208 ''W''&thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''<sub>0</sub>.  If ''X''&thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\u2260 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\n====Unconditionally convergent series====\nSuppose that ''I''&nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n''&nbsp;\u2208 '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} a_n.</math>\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{\\sigma(n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n.</math>\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''\u03b5''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= \u00b11<!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n</math>\n\nconverges in ''X''.  If ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> of vectors in ''X''&thinsp; converges absolutely if\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\|a_n\\| < +\\infty.</math>\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).\n\n====Well-ordered sums====\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example, an [[ordinal number]] ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha + 1} a_\\beta = a_{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta</math>\n\nand for a limit ordinal ''\u03b1'',\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta = \\lim_{\\gamma\\to\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta < \\gamma} a_\\beta</math>\n\nif this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>, then the series converges.\n\n====Examples====\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Given a function ''f''&nbsp;: ''X''\u2192''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X''\n\n:<math>f_a(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\neq a, \\\\\nf(a) & x=a, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\na function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.

Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch up with the tortoise.\n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) [[Sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> of [[Term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is, numbers, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like\n: <math>a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots,</math>\nor, using the [[summation sign]],\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i.</math>\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the {{math|''n''}}th '''partial sums''' of the series. That is,\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i  = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.</math>\nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is '''convergent''' or '''summable''', or that the sequence <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the '''sum''' of the series. Otherwise, the series is said to be '''divergent'''.\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbb R</math> of the [[real number]]s or the field <math>\\mathbb C</math> of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form<ref name=\"SW501\">{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}</ref>\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots, </math>\nwhere <math>(a_n)</math> is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms <math>a_0,a_1,\\dots</math> by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n </math> .\n\nIf an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series <math>s=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n,</math> its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is\n:<math>s_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_k.</math>\nBy definition, the series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math> ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.<ref name=\"SW501\" /> In this case, one usually writes\n:<math>L = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n.</math>\nA series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\n===Convergent series===\n[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]\nA series {{math|\u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}</ref> When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^k a_n.</math>\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\n:<math> 1 + \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots+ \\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, \u00bd, \u00bc, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off \u00bd, we still have a piece of length \u00bd unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&nbsp;\u00bc.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>S/2 = \\frac{1+ \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{16} +\\cdots.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>S-S/2 = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 2.</math>\n\nThe idiom can be extended to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in\n\n:<math>x = 0.111\\dots </math>,\n\nencodes the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{10^n}.</math>\n\nSince these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111... can be identified with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 \u00d7 0.111... = 0.999... = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].\n\n==Examples of numerical series==\n{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}\n* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).

It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[linear function|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the vector space of sequences, denoted \u03a3. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, \u0394. These behave as discrete analogs of [[integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence {1, 1, 1, ...} has series {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that <math>\\int_0^x 1\\,dt = x.</math>\n\nIn [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].\n\n==Properties of series==\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a<sub>n</sub> (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a<sub>n</sub> (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\n===Non-negative terms===\nWhen ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}</math>\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\n:<math>\\frac1 {n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}, \\quad n \\ge 2,</math>\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].\n\n===Absolute convergence===\n{{Main|Absolute convergence}}\nA series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n</math>\nis said to '''converge absolutely''' if the series of [[absolute value]]s\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left|a_n\\right|</math>\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\n===Conditional convergence===\n{{Main|Conditional convergence}}\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\n:<math>\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \\over n} = 1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to&nbsp;ln&nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&nbsp;''S''.\n\n[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\n:<math>\\sum a_n = \\sum \\lambda_n b_n</math>\n\nwhere the partial sums ''B''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''<sub>0</sub> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''b<sub>n</sub>''}} are bounded, ''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub> has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim \u03bb<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} exists:\n\n:<math>\\sup_N \\Bigl| \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\Bigr| < \\infty, \\ \\ \\sum |\\lambda_{n+1} - \\lambda_n| < \\infty\\ \\text{and} \\ \\lambda_n B_n \\ \\text{converges,}</math>\n\nthen the series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} is convergent.  This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin(n x)}{\\ln n}</math>\n\nwith 0&nbsp;< ''x''&nbsp;< 2\u03c0.  Abel's method consists in writing ''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;= ''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212 ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} to the absolutely convergent series\n\n:<math> \\sum (\\lambda_n - \\lambda_{n+1}) \\, B_n.</math>\n\n===Evaluation of truncation errors===\nThe evaluation of truncation errors is an important procedure in [[numerical analysis]] (especially [[validated numerics]] and [[computer-assisted proof]]).\n====[[Alternating series]]====\nWhen conditions of the [[alternating series test]] is satisfied by <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>, there is an exact error evaluation.<ref>[https://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Calculus-Concepts/section/9.9/ Positive and Negative Terms: Alternating Series]</ref> Set <math>s_n</math> as the partial sum of the given alternating series <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>.

If \u2211|''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;| diverges, and |''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;|&nbsp;\u2265 |''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;| for all sufficiently large ''n''&nbsp;, then \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp; also fails to converge absolutely (though it could still be conditionally convergent, for example, if the ''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp; alternate in sign).\n* Comparison test 2 (see [[Limit comparison test]]): If \u2211''b<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp; is an absolutely convergent series such that |''a<sub>n+1</sub>''&nbsp;/''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;|&nbsp;\u2264 |''b<sub>n+1</sub>''&nbsp;/''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;| for sufficiently large ''n''&nbsp;, then \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp; converges absolutely as well.

When the ratio is less than 1, but not less than a constant less than 1, convergence is possible but this test does not establish it.\n* [[Root test]]: If there exists a constant ''C''&nbsp;< 1 such that |''a''<sub>''n''</sub>|<sup>1/''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2264 ''C'' for all sufficiently large&nbsp;''n'', then \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges absolutely.\n* [[Integral test for convergence|Integral test]]: if ''\u0192''(''x'') is a positive [[monotone decreasing]] function defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>1, \u221e<nowiki>)</nowiki><!--DO NOT \"FIX\" THE \"TYPO\" IN THE FOREGOING.

Such a series converges if the [[sequence]] ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[monotone decreasing]] and converges to&nbsp;0. The converse is in general not true.\n* For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].\n\n==Series of functions==\n{{Main|Function series}}\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n(x)</math>\n\n'''[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]]''' on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums\n:<math>s_N(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)</math>\nconverge to ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e for each ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''E''.\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called '''[[uniform convergence]]'''.  The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''\u0192''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,\n:<math>|s_N(x) - f(x)|</math>\ncan be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''\u0192''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''\u0192'' provided\n:<math>\\int_E \\left|s_N(x)-f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx \\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\n===Power series===\n:{{Main|Power series}}\n\nA '''power series''' is a series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-c)^n.</math>\n\nThe [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\nis the Taylor series of <math>e^x</math> at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.\n\nUnless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\n=== Formal power series ===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example, using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: \u00a7III.2.11.</ref>  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\n===Laurent series===\n{{Main|Laurent series}}\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n x^n.</math>\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\n===Dirichlet series===\n:{{Main|Dirichlet series}}\n\nA [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n^s},</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]].  For example, if all ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the [[Riemann zeta function]]\n\n:<math>\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}.</math>\n\nLike the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in [[analytic number theory]].  Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;> 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on <math>\\mathbf{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}</math>&thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&nbsp;1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].\n\n===Trigonometric series===\n{{Main|Trigonometric series}}\nA series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':\n:<math>\\tfrac12 A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(A_n\\cos nx + B_n \\sin nx\\right).</math>\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.\n\n==History of the theory of infinite series==\n\n===Development of infinite series===\n[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|\u03c0]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].\n\n===Convergence criteria===\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1\\cdot\\gamma}x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\beta(\\beta+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\gamma(\\gamma+1)}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\n[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.\n\n[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]\n:<math>1 + \\frac{m}{1!}x + \\frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of <math>m</math> and <math>x</math>. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]\n(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\n[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been\nstudied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\n===Uniform convergence===\nThe theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847\u201348). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\n===Semi-convergence===\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schl\u00f6milch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]\n\n:<math>F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \\cdots + (x - 1)^n.</math>\n\n[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose \"loi supr\u00eame\" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\n===Fourier series===\n[[Fourier series]] were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\n[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still\nearlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,\nas did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schr\u00f6ter|Schr\u00f6ter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820\u201323) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli|Schl\u00e4fli]], and\n[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],\nKrause, Byerly and [[Paul \u00c9mile Appell|Appell]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Asymptotic series===\n[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge, but they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\n===Divergent series===\n{{Main|Divergent series}}\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman\u2013Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.\n\n===Series in Banach spaces===\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,\n:<math>\\biggl\\|x - \\sum_{n=0}^N x_n\\biggr\\|\\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.\n\n===Summations over arbitrary index sets===\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.<ref>{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref>  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf <math>a:I \\mapsto G</math> is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the \"series\" associated to <math>a</math> is the [[formal sum]] of the elements <math>a(x) \\in G </math> over the index elements <math>x \\in I</math> denoted by the\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in I} a(x).</math>\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers <math>I=\\mathbb{N}</math>, the function <math>a:\\mathbb{N} \\mapsto G</math> is a [[sequence]] denoted by <math>a(n)=a_n</math>. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite <math>\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> as <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots.</math>\n\n====Families of non-negative numbers====\nWhen summing a family {''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}, ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\sup \\Bigl\\{ \\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A \\text{ finite, } A \\subset I\\Bigr\\} \\in [0, +\\infty].</math>\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> 0 is countable.  Indeed, for every ''n''&nbsp;\u2265 1, the set <math> A_n = \\{ i \\in I \\,:\\, a_i > 1/n \\}</math> is finite, because\n\n:<math> \\frac 1 n \\, \\textrm{card}(A_n) \\le \\sum_{i\\in A_n} a_i  \\le \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i < \\infty.</math>\n\nIf ''I''&thinsp; is countably infinite and enumerated as ''I''&nbsp;= {''i''<sub>0</sub>, ''i''<sub>1</sub>,...} then the above defined sum satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} a_{i_k},</math>\n\nprovided the value \u221e is allowed for the sum of the series.\n\nAny sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the [[counting measure]], which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.\n\n====Abelian topological groups====\nLet ''a''&nbsp;: ''I'' \u2192 ''X'', where ''I''&thinsp; is any set and ''X''&thinsp; is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Let ''F''&thinsp; be the collection of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]s of ''I'', with ''F'' viewed as a [[directed set]], [[Partially ordered set|ordered]] under [[inclusion (mathematics)|inclusion]] with [[union (set theory)|union]] as [[join (mathematics)|join]].  Define the sum ''S''&thinsp; of the family ''a'' as the limit\n\n:<math> S = \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\lim \\Bigl\\{\\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A\\in F\\Bigr\\}</math>\n\nif it exists and say that the family ''a'' is unconditionally summable.  Saying that the sum ''S''&thinsp; is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>S - \\sum_{i \\in A} a_i \\in V, \\quad A \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nBecause ''F''&thinsp; is not [[total order|totally ordered]], this is not a [[limit of a sequence]] of partial sums, but rather of a [[net (mathematics)|net]].<ref name=\"Bourbaki\">{{cite book|title=General Topology: Chapters 1\u20134 |first=Nicolas |last=Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64241-1 |pages=261\u2013270}}</ref><ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite book|title=Topology |first=Gustave |last=Choquet |authorlink=Gustave Choquet |year=1966 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-173450-3 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nFor every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a smaller neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; such that ''V''&nbsp;\u2212 ''V''&nbsp;\u2282 ''W''. It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is, for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in A_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in A_2} a_i \\in W, \\quad A_1, A_2 \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nWhen ''X''&thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&thinsp; is complete and ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&nbsp;\u2282 ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a<sub>j</sub>'', ''j''&nbsp;\u2208 ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\nIf a family ''a'' in ''X''&thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208 ''W''&thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''<sub>0</sub>.  If ''X''&thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\u2260 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\n====Unconditionally convergent series====\nSuppose that ''I''&nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n''&nbsp;\u2208 '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} a_n.</math>\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{\\sigma(n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n.</math>\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''\u03b5''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= \u00b11<!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n</math>\n\nconverges in ''X''.  If ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> of vectors in ''X''&thinsp; converges absolutely if\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\|a_n\\| < +\\infty.</math>\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).\n\n====Well-ordered sums====\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example, an [[ordinal number]] ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha + 1} a_\\beta = a_{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta</math>\n\nand for a limit ordinal ''\u03b1'',\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta = \\lim_{\\gamma\\to\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta < \\gamma} a_\\beta</math>\n\nif this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>, then the series converges.\n\n====Examples====\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Given a function ''f''&nbsp;: ''X''\u2192''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X''\n\n:<math>f_a(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\neq a, \\\\\nf(a) & x=a, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\na function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.  Then\n\n:<math>f=\\sum_{a \\in X}f_a</math>\n\nin the [[topology of pointwise convergence]] (that is, the sum is taken in the infinite product group ''Y''<sup>''X''&nbsp;</sup>).\n\n|2= In the definition of [[partitions of unity]], one constructs sums of functions over arbitrary index set ''I'',\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i \\in I} \\varphi_i(x) = 1.</math>\n\nWhile, formally, this requires a notion of sums of uncountable series, by construction there are, for every given ''x'', only finitely many nonzero terms in the sum, so issues regarding convergence of such sums do not arise.  Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is ''locally finite'', that is, for every ''x'' there is a neighborhood of ''x'' in which all but a finite number of functions vanish.  Any regularity property of the ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>'',&thinsp; such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.\n\n|3= On the [[first uncountable ordinal]] \u03c9<sub>1</sub> viewed as a topological space in the [[order topology]], the constant function ''f'': [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>] given by ''f''(\u03b1) = 1 satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\alpha\\in[0,\\omega_1)}f(\\alpha) = \\omega_1</math>\n\n(in other words, \u03c9<sub>1</sub> copies of 1 is \u03c9<sub>1</sub>) only if one takes a limit over all ''countable'' partial sums, rather than finite partial sums.

earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.

unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.  California in 2006 had stockpiled three 200-bed mobile hospitals with 50 million N95 respirators, 2,400 ventilators, and 21,000 additional patient beds, but the governor at the time, [[Jerry Brown]], disposed of them in 2011 as a budget cutting measure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-27/coronavirus-california-mobile-hospitals-ventilators|title=California once had mobile hospitals and a ventilator stockpile.
