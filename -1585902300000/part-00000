The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), in the USA, report that the prevalence of obesity among children has doubled and among adolescents has quadrupled in the past 30 years.

The built environment consists of the human-made surroundings that affect one's life; including the availability and quality of sidewalks, crosswalks and parks, the amount of traffic and proximity to schools/parks/shops, etc. These factors determine the [[walkability]] of an area.\n\nWalkability has been shown to be closely tied to childhood obesity.

Money goes towards infrastructure-related programs in addition to non-infrastructure activities such as education and enforcement-year time period, restricting data to school-travel hours.\n\nThis law is central to the success of programs like the Walking Bus because it identifies the many components involved. Active transport to school and examples such as the walking school bus require collaboration from many different sectors (transportation, law enforcement, school policies, and local government to name a few). In addition, the ability to create an environment conducive to walkability is dependent on the built environment as well as numerous policies from these various sectors.\n<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Policies related to active transport to and from school: A multisite case study\n | year = 2008\n | journal = Health Education Research\n | pages = 963\u2013975\n | volume = 23\n | issue = 6\n | last1 = Eyler\t | first1 =  A.A.\n | last2 =  Brownson\t | first2 =  R.C.\n | last3 =  Doescher\t | first3 =  M.P.\n | last4 =  Evenson\t | first4 =  K.R.\n | last5 =  Fesperman\t | first5 =  C.E.\n | last6 =  Litt\t | first6 =  J.S.\n | last7 =  Pluto\t | first7 =  D.\n | last8 =  Steinman\t | first8 =  L.E.\n | last9 =  Terpstra\t | first9 =  J.L.\n | last10 =  Troped\t | first10 =  P.J.\n | last11 =  Schmid\t | first11 =  T.L.  | doi=10.1093/her/cym061| pmid = 17956883\n }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine Report, Measuring Progress in Obesity Prevention, the environment people live in can have a profound effect on the amount of physical activity which they engage in. According to James Sallis in his workshop presentation, informal or formal policies issued by the government or private sector, can affect physical activity in four ways. First, zoning, building codes, public transportation and recreational facility policies affect ability to engage in physical activity. Second, policies affecting physical activity in schools\u2014physical education classes, recess, and walkability to and from school. Policies providing incentives such as parking and commuting in other ways, and insurance subsidies promote walkability and physical activity for adults. Finally funding policies have a strong influence on physical activity.

Active transport to school and examples such as the walking school bus require collaboration from many different sectors (transportation, law enforcement, school policies, and local government to name a few). In addition, the ability to create an environment conducive to walkability is dependent on the built environment as well as numerous policies from these various sectors.\n<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Policies related to active transport to and from school: A multisite case study\n | year = 2008\n | journal = Health Education Research\n | pages = 963\u2013975\n | volume = 23\n | issue = 6\n | last1 = Eyler\t | first1 =  A.A.\n | last2 =  Brownson\t | first2 =  R.C.\n | last3 =  Doescher\t | first3 =  M.P.\n | last4 =  Evenson\t | first4 =  K.R.\n | last5 =  Fesperman\t | first5 =  C.E.\n | last6 =  Litt\t | first6 =  J.S.\n | last7 =  Pluto\t | first7 =  D.\n | last8 =  Steinman\t | first8 =  L.E.\n | last9 =  Terpstra\t | first9 =  J.L.\n | last10 =  Troped\t | first10 =  P.J.\n | last11 =  Schmid\t | first11 =  T.L.  | doi=10.1093/her/cym061| pmid = 17956883\n }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine Report, Measuring Progress in Obesity Prevention, the environment people live in can have a profound effect on the amount of physical activity which they engage in. According to James Sallis in his workshop presentation, informal or formal policies issued by the government or private sector, can affect physical activity in four ways. First, zoning, building codes, public transportation and recreational facility policies affect ability to engage in physical activity. Second, policies affecting physical activity in schools\u2014physical education classes, recess, and walkability to and from school. Policies providing incentives such as parking and commuting in other ways, and insurance subsidies promote walkability and physical activity for adults.

One national study analyzed data across 18 states over 16 years. The study compared rates of pedestrian/bicyclist injury in school-aged children to adults, restricting data to school-travel hours. While adult injury rates were largely unchanged over the study period, implementation of SRTS was associated with around a 20% reduction in both in pedestrian/bicyclist injury and fatality risk in children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DiMaggio|first=Charles|last2=Frangos|first2=Spiros|last3=Li|first3=Guohua|date=2016-06-01|title=National Safe Routes to School program and risk of school-age pedestrian and bicyclist injury|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=6|pages=412\u2013417|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2016.04.002|issn=1873-2585|pmid=27230492|pmc=5248654}}</ref> In Texas, traffic crash data over 5 years showed that pedestrian and bicyclist injuries decreased about 40% after implementation of SRTS.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=DiMaggio|first=Charles|last2=Brady|first2=Joanne|last3=Li|first3=Guohua|date=2015-12-01|title=Association of the Safe Routes to School program with school-age pedestrian and bicyclist injury risk in Texas|journal=Injury Epidemiology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.1186/s40621-015-0038-3|pmc=5005687|pmid=27747747}}</ref> In New York city, SRTS decreased pedestrian injury by one-third in school-age children.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dimaggio|first=Charles|last2=Li|first2=Guohua|date=2013-02-01|title=Effectiveness of a safe routes to school program in preventing school-aged pedestrian injury|journal=Pediatrics|volume=131|issue=2|pages=290\u2013296|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2182|issn=1098-4275|pmc=3557410|pmid=23319533}}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of SRTS may extend beyond children.
