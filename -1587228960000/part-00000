The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's second-latest start on record (behind only the [[1986\u201387 Australian region cyclone season|1986\u201387 season]]), with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020, which would later become Tropical Cyclone Blake. A total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since [[2016-17 Australian region cyclone season|the 2016\u201317 season]]. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating west of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]].

when most [[tropical cyclones]] form in the southern [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans between [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]] and [[160th meridian east|160\u00b0E]]. The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's second-latest start on record (behind only the [[1986\u201387 Australian region cyclone season|1986\u201387 season]]), with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020, which would later become Tropical Cyclone Blake. A total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since [[2016-17 Australian region cyclone season|the 2016\u201317 season]]. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

Blake would later make landfall in  northwestern [[Australia]] and soon degenerate afterwards. At the same time, Claudia, another tropical cyclone, formed. It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating west of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]].
