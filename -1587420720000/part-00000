The operation targeted a key [[Viet Cong]] headquarters that was believed to be concealed underground, and involved two [[brigade]]s under the command of the [[US 1st Infantry Division]], including the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (1 RAR) which was attached to the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|US 173rd Airborne Brigade]]. Heavy fighting resulted in significant casualties on both sides, but the combined American and Australian force was able to uncover an extensive tunnel network covering more than {{convert|200|km|mi}}.\n\nThe operation was the largest allied military action mounted during the war in South Vietnam to that point, and the first fought at [[division (military)|division]] level. Despite some success, the allied force was only able to partially clear the area and it remained a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war. The tunnels were later used as a staging area for the attack on [[Saigon]] during the [[Tet Offensive|1968 Tet offensive]] before they were largely destroyed by heavy bombing from American [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]]s in 1970, ending their utility.{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{main|Vietnam War|Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War}}\nAlthough the initial American commitment to the war in Vietnam had been limited to advice and materiel support, by 1964 there were 21,000 US advisors in South Vietnam.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=54}} However, with the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) weakened by successive defeats at the hands of the communists, the South Vietnamese government faltering, and [[Saigon]] threatened with a major offensive, the worsening situation led to a significant escalation of the war in 1965, with a large-scale commitment of US ground troops under the command of [[General]] [[William Westmoreland]].{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=53\u201367}} At first the Americans had adopted a cautious strategy, applied to the strictly limited role of base defence by [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] units. This was abandoned in April 1965, and replaced by a new \"enclave strategy\" of defending key coastal population centres and installations.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=63\u201367}} This strategy required the introduction of nine additional US [[battalion]]s, or 14,000 troops, to bring the total in Vietnam to 13. Allied nations of the [[Free World Military Forces]] were expected to contribute another four battalions.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=67}}\n\nWestmoreland planned to develop a series of defensive positions around Saigon before expanding operations to [[wikt:pacification|pacify]] the South Vietnamese country-side and as a result a number of sites close to Viet Cong dominated areas were subsequently chosen to be developed into semi-permanent divisional-level bases. Such areas included [[D\u0129 An Base Camp|Di An]] which was intended to become the headquarters of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|US 1st Infantry Division]], while the [[25th Division (United States)|US 25th Infantry Division]] would be based in the vicinity of [[C\u1ee7 Chi district, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City|Cu Chi]]. However, large-scale military operations to clear the intended base areas had to wait until the dry season.{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|pp=43\u201344}} Yet the allied enclave strategy proved only transitory and further setbacks led to additional troop increases to halt the losing trend.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=66}} With the situation reaching crisis point during the Viet Cong wet season offensive in June 1965, Westmoreland requested further reinforcement and US and allied forces increased to 44 battalions which would be used to directly bolster the ARVN.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=95}}\n\nAustralia's growing involvement in Vietnam reflected the American build up.

By 1965 they formed an underground maze of passages, fighting tunnels, meeting rooms and food caches, stretching from Saigon to the Cambodian border.

At 14:00 a number of Viet Cong dug-in in trenches were encountered, and following a series of air-strikes and artillery barrages, the cavalry and the Australian M113s swept the area during which several Australians were slightly injured by a misdirected [[US Navy]] air-strike.

A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American was killed by a Viet Cong soldier who suddenly appeared out of a large anthill.{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|p=53}} Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.{{sfn|McAulay|2005|p=173}}\n\n===Action concludes, 14 January 1966===\n[[File:US 105mm howitizer firing during Operation Crimp, January 1966.PNG|thumb|220px|right|A US 105&nbsp;mm howitizer providing fire support to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade on the final day of Operation Crimp.|alt=Soldiers operating a field gun. A large cloud of smoke is coming from the barrel while there is a pile of used shells to the rear]]\nUltimately, more than {{convert|17|km|mi}} of tunnels had been uncovered and searched by the Australians. A large quantity of documents had been recovered, including more than 100,000 pages detailing operational structure as well as the names of agents operating in Saigon. Ninety weapons were also captured, as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition and enough equipment, food and other supplies to fill eight 2\u00bd-tonne trucks.{{sfn|Carland|2000|p=280}} Although the US battalions had played a large part in the operation and had also uncovered numerous tunnel systems and been involved in heavy contact, by the fortunes of war 1 RAR had been allocated the area of operations that was ultimately found to contain the Viet Cong headquarters. The Australians had even partially searched the tunnel leading to the headquarters that was their objective, but did not learn how close they had come to succeeding until decades after the war had ended.{{sfn|MacGregor|Thomson|1993|pp=125\u2013126}} During the course of these activities the searchers had suffered a number of additional fatalities from Viet Cong snipers.{{sfn|Carland|2000|p=280}}\n\nFully exploring and destroying the tunnels was well beyond the allied resources available, and the decision was eventually made to call a halt to operations.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=193}} Six days after it began, Operation Crimp ended, with 1 RAR returning to Bien Hoa on 14 January.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=280}} By the time the operation was concluded only a fraction of the known tunnel network had been destroyed and it was not until after the war that it was learnt that the system at Cu Chi actually included more than {{convert|200|km|mi}} of tunnels.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=280}} Although further American ground operations as well a number of heavy B52 bombing raids resulted in further damage to the tunnel complexes, the Ho Bo Woods were never occupied on a permanent basis and the Viet Cong were successful in restoring their transit and supply functions. {{sfn|Breen|1988|p=196}} As such, despite significant disruption, the military and political apparatus in Cu Chi remained largely intact, allowing the communists freedom of action for later operations against Saigon.{{sfn|MacGregor|Thomson|1993|p=126}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Casualties===\nDuring the fighting the Australians had faced stiff resistance and had suffered eight killed and 29 wounded, while claiming 27 Viet Cong killed and a further 30 probably killed. The Americans had also been involved in heavy fighting and their casualties included 14 killed and 76 wounded. Total communist casualties included 128 confirmed killed, and another 190 probably killed, as well as 92 captured and another 509 suspects detained.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=442\u2013443}} In addition many more Viet Cong were thought likely to have perished in the tunnels as they were collapsed by charges laid by the Australian engineers.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=196}} The Americans later claimed that the headquarters of the communist 4th Military Region had also been destroyed.{{sfn|Bradley|2006|p=16}} Due to the quantity of information recovered from the thousands of captured documents alone, the battle was later described as the first allied strategic intelligence victory of the war.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=175}} So significant was the find that both Westmoreland and General [[Joseph A. McChristian|Joseph McChristian]], the head of Intelligence at [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]], visited 1 RAR during Operation Crimp.{{sfn|McAulay|2007|p=34}}{{refn|Neither Westmoreland nor McChristian referred to the operation in their end of tour reports, however.{{sfn|McAulay|2007|p=34}}|group=Note}} Allied operations against the communist tunnels had been largely ad hoc, and the Australians began to develop the earliest techniques for exploring and destroying them.{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|p=57}} Later, at least partially as a result of the success of the Australians in clearing some of the shorter tunnels, American units adopted similar tactics and created a number of tunnel-clearance teams, known popularly as [[Tunnel rat (military)|Tunnel Rats]].{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|pp=101\u2013102}}{{refn|The Australian teams were originally referred to as \"ferrets\".{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|p=56}}|group=Note}}\n\n===Assessment===\nDespite the losses suffered by the communists, the combined American and Australian force had only succeeded in partially clearing the area and the tunnel network it concealed, and consequently the Ho Bo Woods would remain a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=280}} Indeed, the bulk of the communist force had successfully withdrawn intact, leaving only rear guard elements in defence, prompting the communists to also declare the operation a victory, claiming almost 2,000 American troops killed or wounded, 100 vehicles destroyed, and 50 aircraft shot down.{{sfn|Van Thai|Van Quang|2002|p=176}} Yet, such claims were based on estimates of casualties caused by command-detonated mines, punji sticks and other booby traps, and proved to be wildly inaccurate.{{sfn|McAulay|2005|p=200}} In fact Operation Crimp had rattled the communists, and they subsequently ordered their units in the south to prevent the Americans from concentrating their forces in the future.{{sfn|Ang|2002|p=104}} Regardless, it also highlighted the inherent weakness of the search-and-clear operations that would later become standard operating procedure for the US Army in Vietnam.{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|p=60}} The Ho Bo Woods were again targeted by the Americans in January 1967, during a much larger operation known as [[Operation Cedar Falls]].{{sfn|McAulay|2005|pp=232\u2013234}} However, despite heavy casualties again being inflicted on the Viet Cong, the tunnels continued to remain a problem for the Americans and they were later used as a communist staging area for the attack on Saigon during the [[Tet Offensive|1968 Tet offensive]].{{sfn|McAulay|2005|p=235}} Finally in 1970, American B-52 bombers carried out a number of heavy air-strikes on the area, dropping thousands of delayed-fuse bombs that buried deep into the ground before exploding, ending the tunnels' utility.{{sfn|Sullivan|2008|p=B06}} Operation Crimp was 1 RAR's third and last foray into the communist heartland and following the fighting they had more than two weeks rest in Bien Hoa\u2014their longest break from operations during the battalion's tour.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=164 and 169}} Further operations followed in the months afterwards, including the [[Battle of Suoi Bong Trang]] on the night of 23\u201324 February 1966.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=280}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\nAt the strategic level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after appearing on the verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=171}} The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade\u2014the [[1st Australian Task Force]]\u2014with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=177}} 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in [[Phuoc Tuy Province]], thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at [[Nui Dat]], while logistic arrangements were provided by the [[1st Australian Logistics Support Group]] which was subsequently established at the port of [[Vung Tau]].{{sfn|Dennis et

The operation targeted a key [[Viet Cong]] headquarters that was believed to be concealed underground, and involved two [[brigade]]s under the command of the [[US 1st Infantry Division]], including the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (1 RAR) which was attached to the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|US 173rd Airborne Brigade]]. Heavy fighting resulted in significant casualties on both sides, but the combined American and Australian force was able to uncover an extensive tunnel network covering more than {{convert|200|km|mi}}.\n\nThe operation was the largest allied military action mounted during the war in South Vietnam to that point, and the first fought at [[division (military)|division]] level. Despite some success, the allied force was only able to partially clear the area and it remained a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war. The tunnels were later used as a staging area for the attack on [[Saigon]] during the [[Tet Offensive|1968 Tet offensive]] before they were largely destroyed by heavy bombing from American [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]]s in 1970, ending their utility.{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{main|Vietnam War|Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War}}\nAlthough the initial American commitment to the war in Vietnam had been limited to advice and materiel support, by 1964 there were 21,000 US advisors in South Vietnam.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=54}} However, with the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) weakened by successive defeats at the hands of the communists, the South Vietnamese government faltering, and [[Saigon]] threatened with a major offensive, the worsening situation led to a significant escalation of the war in 1965, with a large-scale commitment of US ground troops under the command of [[General]] [[William Westmoreland]].{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=53\u201367}} At first the Americans had adopted a cautious strategy, applied to the strictly limited role of base defence by [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] units. This was abandoned in April 1965, and replaced by a new \"enclave strategy\" of defending key coastal population centres and installations.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=63\u201367}} This strategy required the introduction of nine additional US [[battalion]]s, or 14,000 troops, to bring the total in Vietnam to 13. Allied nations of the [[Free World Military Forces]] were expected to contribute another four battalions.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=67}}\n\nWestmoreland planned to develop a series of defensive positions around Saigon before expanding operations to [[wikt:pacification|pacify]] the South Vietnamese country-side and as a result a number of sites close to Viet Cong dominated areas were subsequently chosen to be developed into semi-permanent divisional-level bases. Such areas included [[D\u0129 An Base Camp|Di An]] which was intended to become the headquarters of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|US 1st Infantry Division]], while the [[25th Division (United States)|US 25th Infantry Division]] would be based in the vicinity of [[C\u1ee7 Chi district, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City|Cu Chi]]. However, large-scale military operations to clear the intended base areas had to wait until the dry season.{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|pp=43\u201344}} Yet the allied enclave strategy proved only transitory and further setbacks led to additional troop increases to halt the losing trend.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=66}} With the situation reaching crisis point during the Viet Cong wet season offensive in June 1965, Westmoreland requested further reinforcement and US and allied forces increased to 44 battalions which would be used to directly bolster the ARVN.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=95}}\n\nAustralia's growing involvement in Vietnam reflected the American build up. In 1963, the Australian government had committed a small advisory team, known as the [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam]] (AATTV), to help train the [[ARVN|South Vietnamese forces]].{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=555}} However, in June 1965 the decision to commit ground troops was made, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\u2014originally commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan 'Lou' Brumfield\u2014was dispatched. Supporting 1 RAR was [[1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron (Australia)|1 Troop, A Squadron, 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse]] equipped with [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M-113 Armoured Personnel Carriers]], artillery from [[105th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery]] and [[Royal New Zealand Artillery|161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery]], and [[161st Independent Reconnaissance Flight (Australia)|161st Reconnaissance Flight]] operating [[Cessna 180]]s and [[Bell H-13 Sioux]] light observation helicopters; in total 1,400 personnel.{{sfn|McAulay|2005|p=4}}{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=xxv}} The Australian and New Zealand units were attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade under the command of [[Brigadier General]] Ellis W.

During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into [[War Zone D]]\u2014a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces\u2014as well as in the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]], formed by the confluence of the [[Saigon River|Saigon]] and Thi Tinh rivers and Route 7, where they fought a number of significant actions including the [[Battle of Gang Toi]] on 8 November.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|pp=277\u2013279}} Meanwhile, Brumfield was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece, after an old football injury forced his evacuation to Australia in mid-November.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=150}} During the period 21 November to 16 December 1 RAR was involved in Operation New Life in the La Nga Valley, {{convert|75|km|mi}} north-east of Bien Hoa in an attempt to deny the Viet Cong access to the rice harvest.

Since then they had endured constant bombing, all the while being expanded. By 1965 they formed an underground maze of passages, fighting tunnels, meeting rooms and food caches, stretching from Saigon to the Cambodian border.

At 14:00 a number of Viet Cong dug-in in trenches were encountered, and following a series of air-strikes and artillery barrages, the cavalry and the Australian M113s swept the area during which several Australians were slightly injured by a misdirected [[US Navy]] air-strike.

Total communist casualties included 128 confirmed killed, and another 190 probably killed, as well as 92 captured and another 509 suspects detained.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=442\u2013443}} In addition many more Viet Cong were thought likely to have perished in the tunnels as they were collapsed by charges laid by the Australian engineers.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=196}} The Americans later claimed that the headquarters of the communist 4th Military Region had also been destroyed.{{sfn|Bradley|2006|p=16}} Due to the quantity of information recovered from the thousands of captured documents alone, the battle was later described as the first allied strategic intelligence victory of the war.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=175}} So significant was the find that both Westmoreland and General [[Joseph A. McChristian|Joseph McChristian]], the head of Intelligence at [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]], visited 1 RAR during Operation Crimp.{{sfn|McAulay|2007|p=34}}{{refn|Neither Westmoreland nor McChristian referred to the operation in their end of tour reports, however.{{sfn|McAulay|2007|p=34}}|group=Note}} Allied operations against the communist tunnels had been largely ad hoc, and the Australians began to develop the earliest techniques for exploring and destroying them.{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|p=57}} Later, at least partially as a result of the success of the Australians in clearing some of the shorter tunnels, American units adopted similar tactics and created a number of tunnel-clearance teams, known popularly as [[Tunnel rat (military)|Tunnel Rats]].{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|pp=101\u2013102}}{{refn|The Australian teams were originally referred to as \"ferrets\".{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|p=56}}|group=Note}}\n\n===Assessment===\nDespite the losses suffered by the communists, the combined American and Australian force had only succeeded in partially clearing the area and the tunnel network it concealed, and consequently the Ho Bo Woods would remain a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=280}} Indeed, the bulk of the communist force had successfully withdrawn intact, leaving only rear guard elements in defence, prompting the communists to also declare the operation a victory, claiming almost 2,000 American troops killed or wounded, 100 vehicles destroyed, and 50 aircraft shot down.{{sfn|Van Thai|Van Quang|2002|p=176}} Yet, such claims were based on estimates of casualties caused by command-detonated mines, punji sticks and other booby traps, and proved to be wildly inaccurate.{{sfn|McAulay|2005|p=200}} In fact Operation Crimp had rattled the communists, and they subsequently ordered their units in the south to prevent the Americans from concentrating their forces in the future.{{sfn|Ang|2002|p=104}} Regardless, it also highlighted the inherent weakness of the search-and-clear operations that would later become standard operating procedure for the US Army in Vietnam.{{sfn|Mangold|Penycate|1985|p=60}} The Ho Bo Woods were again targeted by the Americans in January 1967, during a much larger operation known as [[Operation Cedar Falls]].{{sfn|McAulay|2005|pp=232\u2013234}} However, despite heavy casualties again being inflicted on the Viet Cong, the tunnels continued to remain a problem for the Americans and they were later used as a communist staging area for the attack on Saigon during the [[Tet Offensive|1968 Tet offensive]].{{sfn|McAulay|2005|p=235}} Finally in 1970, American B-52 bombers carried out a number of heavy air-strikes on the area, dropping thousands of delayed-fuse bombs that buried deep into the ground before exploding, ending the tunnels' utility.{{sfn|Sullivan|2008|p=B06}} Operation Crimp was 1 RAR's third and last foray into the communist heartland and following the fighting they had more than two weeks rest in Bien Hoa\u2014their longest break from operations during the battalion's tour.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|pp=164 and 169}} Further operations followed in the months afterwards, including the [[Battle of Suoi Bong Trang]] on the night of 23\u201324 February 1966.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=280}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\nAt the strategic level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after appearing on the verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966.{{sfn|McNeill|1993|p=171}} The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade\u2014the [[1st Australian Task Force]]\u2014with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=177}} 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in [[Phuoc Tuy Province]], thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at [[Nui Dat]], while logistic arrangements were provided by the [[1st Australian Logistics Support Group]] which was subsequently established at the port of [[Vung Tau]].{{sfn|Dennis et

It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.\n\nStructurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the two-stage lunar module was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM), about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the complete lunar module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface.  During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then [[Lunar orbit rendezvous|flew back to the command module]], after which it was also discarded.\n\nOverseen by [[Grumman Aircraft]], the LM's development was plagued with problems that delayed its first uncrewed flight by about ten months and its first crewed flight by about three months. Still, the LM became the most reliable component of the Apollo/Saturn [[space vehicle]].<ref>''Moon Race: The History of Apollo'' DVD, Columbia River Entertainment (Portland, Oregon, 2007)</ref>  The total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.3&nbsp;billion in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.2&nbsp;billion<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://georgetyson.com/files/apollostatistics.pdf|title=Apollo by the Numbers|last=Orloff|first=Richard|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=22}}</ref> using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2013_NNSI_FY14(1).xlsx|title=NASA New Start Inflation Indices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTen lunar modules were launched into space. Of these, six landed humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two launched were test flights in [[low Earth orbit]]\u2014the first without a crew, the second with one. Another was used by [[Apollo 10]] for a dress rehearsal flight in low lunar orbit, without landing. One lunar module functioned as a lifeboat for the crew of [[Apollo 13]], providing life support and propulsion when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, forcing the crew to abandon plans for landing.\n\nThe six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites; their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon following use. One ascent stage (Apollo 10's ''Snoopy'') was discarded in a [[heliocentric orbit]] after its descent stage was discarded in lunar orbit.  The other three LMs were burned up in the Earth's atmosphere: the four stages of [[Apollo 5]] and [[Apollo 9]] each re-entered separately, while Apollo 13's ''Aquarius'' re-entered complete, following emergency maneuvers.\n\n==Operational profile==\nAt launch, the lunar module sat directly beneath the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM) with legs folded, inside the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft\u2013lunar module adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA)]] attached to the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.\n\nSoon after TLI, the SLA opened; the CSM separated, turned around, came back to dock with the lunar module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the lunar module pilot entered the LM to temporarily power up and test all systems except propulsion. The lunar module pilot performed the role of an engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.\n\nAfter achieving a lunar parking orbit, the commander and LM pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the lunar module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the commander informed about systems status and navigational information. After the command module pilot visually inspected the [[Landing gear (spaceflight)|landing gear]], the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then rotated until the [[Descent propulsion system|descent engine]] was pointed forward into the direction of travel. A 30-second descent orbit insertion burn was performed to reduce speed and drop the LM's [[perilune]] to within about {{convert|50000|ft|km}} of the surface,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11g_Lunar_Orbit_Phase.htm|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Orbit Phase|publisher=}}</ref> about {{convert|260|nmi|km}} uprange of the landing site.\n\n[[File:Earth, Moon and Lunar Module, AS11-44-6643.jpg|thumb|''Eagle'', the lunar module ascent stage of [[Apollo 11]], in orbit above the Moon.

During this time, the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During braking, the LM descended to about {{convert|10000|ft|km}}, then, in the final approach phase, down to about {{convert|700|ft|m}}. During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Gatland\n| first = Kenneth\n| title = Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision\n| publisher = Macmillan Publishing Co.\n| location = New York\n| year = 1976\n| pages = 194\u2013196\n| isbn = 0-02-542820-9 }}\n</ref>\n\nAstronauts flew Apollo spacecraft manually only during the lunar approach.<ref name=\"agle199809\">{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.C. |date=September 1998 |title=Flying the Gusmobile |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flying-the-gusmobile-218187/ |magazine=Air & Space |language=en |access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> The final landing phase began about {{convert|2000|ft|km}} uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point, manual control was enabled for the commander, who had enough [[liquid rocket propellant|propellant]] to hover for up to two minutes to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three {{convert|67.2|in|m|adj=on}} probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to manually shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing might puncture an astronaut's suit as he descended or stepped off the ladder.\n\nThe original [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside \"to maintain communications\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuRCwsGugg&t=3m20s Landing on the Moon], 1966 episode of MIT's ''Science Reporter'' (posted to YouTube by MIT on Jan 20, 2016)<br />Quote:<br />\"While one astronaut explores the area around the LEM, the second remains inside to maintain communications.\"</ref> Communications were eventually deemed to be reliable enough to allow both crew members to walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.\n\nBeginning with [[Apollo 14]], extra LM propellant was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the {{convert|50000|ft|km|adj=on}} perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.\n\nWhen ready to leave the Moon, the LM's ascent engine fired, leaving the descent stage on the Moon's surface. After a few course correction burns, the LM rendezvoused with the CSM and docked to transfer the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired until its fuel was used up, sending it past the Moon into a [[heliocentric orbit]].<ref name=\"nasa_apollo10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 |editor-last=Ryba |editor-first=Jeanne |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"disposition\">{{cite web|title=Current locations of the Apollo Command Module Capsules (and Lunar Module crash sites)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html|website=Apollo: Where are they now?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> The [[Apollo 11]] ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Francis Shea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1962 model of the first LEM design, docked to the command and service module. The model is held by [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], the key engineer behind the adoption of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission logistics.]]\nThe lunar module (originally designated the lunar excursion module, known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEM) was designed after NASA [[Project Apollo#Choosing a mission mode|chose to reach the Moon]] via [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR) instead of the [[direct ascent]] or [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.\n\n===Contract letting===\nIn July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. [[Grumman Aircraft]] was awarded the contract two months later. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350&nbsp;million. There were initially four major subcontractors: [[Bell Aerosystems]] ([[Ascent Propulsion System|ascent engine]]), [[Hamilton Standard]] (environmental control systems), [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] (reaction control system) and [[TRW Inc.|TRW's]] [[Space Technology Laboratories]] ([[Descent Propulsion System|descent engine]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch6-5.html |title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft; Engines, Large and Small |author1=Courtney G.

A backup navigation tool, the [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|Abort Guidance System]] (AGS), was developed by TRW.\n\n===Design phase===\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|thumb|This 1963 model depicts the second LEM design, which gave rise to informal references as \"the bug\".]]\nThe Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer [[Thomas J.

The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.\n\nAs the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. Egress while wearing bulky [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activity]] (EVA) spacesuits was eased by a simpler forward hatch (32 x 32 inches).\n\nThe configuration was frozen in April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the '''descent engine'''<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph45.pdf|title=REMEMBERING THE GIANTS - Apollo Rocket Propulsion Development - NASA|publisher=NASA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73-86}}</ref> was ordered from [[TRW Inc.#Space exploration|Space Technology Laboratories (TRW)]] in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.\n\nPower was initially to be produced by [[fuel cell]]s built by [[Pratt and Whitney]] similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|title=LM Electrical|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201084039/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} -->\n\nThe initial design had three landing legs, the lightest possible configuration.

Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV's were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, [[Neil Armstrong]].<ref name=\"ugly\">{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LLRV.html|title=LLRV Monograph|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Development flights===\n[[File:67-H-1230 Lunar module LTA-2 R.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 6]] Lunar Module Test Article (LTA-2R) shortly before being mated with the SLA]]\n\nLM-1 was built to make the first uncrewed flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a [[Saturn IB]]. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first crewed flight later that year. But the LM's development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1's flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as [[Apollo 5]]. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.\n\nLM-3 now became the first crewed LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until [[Apollo 9]] on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit crewed practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled to keep the program timeline on track.\n\n[[Apollo 10]] launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a \"dress rehearsal\" for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff.

Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the Command Module ''Columbia'' splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing [[Apollo Program#Background|President John F. Kennedy's goal]]: \"...before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\".\n\nThis was followed by landings by [[Apollo 12]] ''(Intrepid)'' and [[Apollo 14]] ''(Antares)''.[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 11 lunar module ''Eagle'' in lunar orbit]]In April 1970, the [[Apollo 13]] lunar module ''Aquarius'' played an unexpected role in saving the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module|service module]] ruptured, disabling the CSM. ''Aquarius'' served as a \"lifeboat\" for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its [[Descent Propulsion System|descent stage engine]] was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module's batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely on April 17, 1970. The LM's systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including twice depressurization and repressurization causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without depressurization and repressurization and loss of oxygen supply).\n\nHover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a {{convert|9.1|nmi|km|adj=on}} perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach.

It contained its own [[Ascent Propulsion System]] (APS) engine and two [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks for return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the [[Apollo command and service module]]. It also contained a Reaction Control System (RCS) for [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[translation (geometry)|translation]] control, which consisted of sixteen hypergolic thrusters similar to those used on the Service Module, mounted in four quads, with their own propellant supply. A forward EVA hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.\n\nInternal equipment included an environmental control (life support) system; a VHF communications system with two antennas for communication with the Command Module; a [[unified S-band]] system and steerable [[parabolic antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] for communication with Earth; an EVA antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts' [[Primary life support system|Portable Life Support System]]s through the LM; [[Apollo PGNCS|primary (PGNCS)]] and [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|backup (AGS)]] guidance and navigation systems; an [[Apollo PGNCS#Optical unit|Alignment Optical Telescope]] for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and an system for active thermal control.

When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Its octagonal shape was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a [[throttle]]able [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS) engine with four [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks. A [[continuous-wave radar|continuous-wave]] [[Doppler radar]] antenna was mounted by the engine [[heat shield]] on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing. Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized [[Kapton]] foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the \"porch\") in front of the ascent stage's EVA hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin to the surface. The footpad of each landing leg incorporated a {{convert|67|in|m|adj=mid|-long}} surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)\n\nEquipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A [[Lunar Flag Assembly|United States flag]] for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.\n\nThe Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP) (later the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP)), was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that acceptable communications were being received using the LM's S-band antenna, but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 13 and 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions ([[Apollo 15]] and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel. Compartments also contained replacement [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS) batteries and extra lithium hydroxide canisters on the extended missions.\n\n* Height: {{convert|10|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} (plus {{convert|5|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} landing probes)\n* Width/depth, minus landing gear: {{convert|13|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width/depth, landing gear extended: {{convert|31.0|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass including propellant: {{convert|22,783|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Water: one {{convert|151|kg|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tank\n* DPS propellant mass: {{convert|18,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in four {{convert|67.3|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=4}} propellant tanks\n* DPS engine: [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] [[Descent Propulsion System|LM descent engine (LMDE)]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |title=TR-201 for Delta rocket second stage derived from LMDE |date=1972 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706190928/http://astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=REMEMBERING THE GIANTS - Apollo Rocket Propulsion Development - NASA|publisher=NASA|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73-86}}</ref>\n* DPS thrust: {{convert|10,125|lbf|N|abbr=on}}, throttleable between 10% and 60% of full thrust\n* DPS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* DPS pressurant: one {{convert|49|lb|kg|adj=on}} supercritical helium tank at {{convert|1555|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}\n* DPS [[specific impulse]]: 311 s (3,050 N\u22c5s/kg)\n* DPS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|8,100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* Batteries: four (Apollo 9-14) or five (Apollo 15-17) 28\u201332 V, 415 A\u22c5h silver-zinc batteries; {{convert|135|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n\n==Lunar modules produced==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This would have been launched on an uncrewed Saturn 1B, and docked with a crewed [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]], named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).\n\nThis idea was later transferred to the original [[wet workshop]] design for the ''[[Skylab]]'' orbital workshop and renamed the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] to be docked on a side port of the workshop's multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a \"dry workshop\" design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.\n\n===LM Truck===\nThe Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to {{convert|11000|lb|t}} of payload to the Moon for an uncrewed landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent crewed [[lunar base]]. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the \"truck\" while the orbiting crew returned to Earth.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm Apollo LM Truck on Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215210907/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm |date=2005-12-15 }} \u2013 Description of adapted LM descent stage for the uncrewed transport of cargo to a permanent lunar base.</ref> In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an uncrewed lunar ferry vehicle.\n\n==Depiction in film and television==\nThe 1995 Ron Howard film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', a dramatization of that mission starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Kevin Bacon]], and [[Bill Paxton]], was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the ''Aquarius'' and the Command Module ''Odyssey''.\n\nThe development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|\"Spider\"]]. This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named ''Spider'' after its spidery appearance. The unused LM-13 stood in during the teleplay to depict LM-3 and LM-5, ''Eagle'', used by Apollo 11.\n\n==Media==\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"110px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 1 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (1 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 2 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (2 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Control Displays.jpg|Controls plans\nFile:Lunar Module Landing Gear plans.jpg|Landing Gear plans\n</gallery>\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"350px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Apollo 15 landing on the Moon.ogg|[[Apollo 15]] landing on the Moon seen from the perspective of the Lunar Module Pilot.

It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.\n\nStructurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the two-stage lunar module was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM), about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the complete lunar module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface.  During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then [[Lunar orbit rendezvous|flew back to the command module]], after which it was also discarded.\n\nOverseen by [[Grumman Aircraft]], the LM's development was plagued with problems that delayed its first uncrewed flight by about ten months and its first crewed flight by about three months. Still, the LM became the most reliable component of the Apollo/Saturn [[space vehicle]].<ref>''Moon Race: The History of Apollo'' DVD, Columbia River Entertainment (Portland, Oregon, 2007)</ref>  The total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.3&nbsp;billion in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.2&nbsp;billion<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://georgetyson.com/files/apollostatistics.pdf|title=Apollo by the Numbers|last=Orloff|first=Richard|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=22}}</ref> using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2013_NNSI_FY14(1).xlsx|title=NASA New Start Inflation Indices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTen lunar modules were launched into space. Of these, six landed humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two launched were test flights in [[low Earth orbit]]\u2014the first without a crew, the second with one. Another was used by [[Apollo 10]] for a dress rehearsal flight in low lunar orbit, without landing. One lunar module functioned as a lifeboat for the crew of [[Apollo 13]], providing life support and propulsion when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, forcing the crew to abandon plans for landing.\n\nThe six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites; their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon following use. One ascent stage (Apollo 10's ''Snoopy'') was discarded in a [[heliocentric orbit]] after its descent stage was discarded in lunar orbit.  The other three LMs were burned up in the Earth's atmosphere: the four stages of [[Apollo 5]] and [[Apollo 9]] each re-entered separately, while Apollo 13's ''Aquarius'' re-entered complete, following emergency maneuvers.\n\n==Operational profile==\nAt launch, the lunar module sat directly beneath the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM) with legs folded, inside the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft\u2013lunar module adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA)]] attached to the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.\n\nSoon after TLI, the SLA opened; the CSM separated, turned around, came back to dock with the lunar module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the lunar module pilot entered the LM to temporarily power up and test all systems except propulsion. The lunar module pilot performed the role of an engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.\n\nAfter achieving a lunar parking orbit, the commander and LM pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the lunar module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the commander informed about systems status and navigational information. After the command module pilot visually inspected the [[Landing gear (spaceflight)|landing gear]], the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then rotated until the descent engine was pointed forward into the direction of travel.

During this time, the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During braking, the LM descended to about {{convert|10000|ft|km}}, then, in the final approach phase, down to about {{convert|700|ft|m}}. During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Gatland\n| first = Kenneth\n| title = Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision\n| publisher = Macmillan Publishing Co.\n| location = New York\n| year = 1976\n| pages = 194\u2013196\n| isbn = 0-02-542820-9 }}\n</ref>\n\nAstronauts flew Apollo spacecraft manually only during the lunar approach.<ref name=\"agle199809\">{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.C. |date=September 1998 |title=Flying the Gusmobile |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flying-the-gusmobile-218187/ |magazine=Air & Space |language=en |access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> The final landing phase began about {{convert|2000|ft|km}} uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point, manual control was enabled for the commander, who had enough [[liquid rocket propellant|propellant]] to hover for up to two minutes to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three {{convert|67.2|in|m|adj=on}} probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to manually shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing might puncture an astronaut's suit as he descended or stepped off the ladder.\n\nThe original [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside \"to maintain communications\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuRCwsGugg&t=3m20s Landing on the Moon], 1966 episode of MIT's ''Science Reporter'' (posted to YouTube by MIT on Jan 20, 2016)<br />Quote:<br />\"While one astronaut explores the area around the LEM, the second remains inside to maintain communications.\"</ref> Communications were eventually deemed to be reliable enough to allow both crew members to walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.\n\nBeginning with [[Apollo 14]], extra LM propellant was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the {{convert|50000|ft|km|adj=on}} perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.\n\nWhen ready to leave the Moon, the LM's ascent engine fired, leaving the descent stage on the Moon's surface. After a few course correction burns, the LM rendezvoused with the CSM and docked to transfer the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired until its fuel was used up, sending it past the Moon into a [[heliocentric orbit]].<ref name=\"nasa_apollo10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 |editor-last=Ryba |editor-first=Jeanne |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"disposition\">{{cite web|title=Current locations of the Apollo Command Module Capsules (and Lunar Module crash sites)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html|website=Apollo: Where are they now?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> The [[Apollo 11]] ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Francis Shea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1962 model of the first LEM design, docked to the command and service module. The model is held by [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], the key engineer behind the adoption of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission logistics.]]\nThe lunar module (originally designated the lunar excursion module, known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEM) was designed after NASA [[Project Apollo#Choosing a mission mode|chose to reach the Moon]] via [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR) instead of the [[direct ascent]] or [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.\n\n===Contract letting===\nIn July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. [[Grumman Aircraft]] was awarded the contract two months later. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350&nbsp;million. There were initially four major subcontractors: [[Bell Aerosystems]] ([[Ascent Propulsion System|ascent engine]]), [[Hamilton Standard]] (environmental control systems), [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] (reaction control system) and [[TRW Inc.|TRW's]] [[Space Technology Laboratories]] ([[Descent Propulsion System|descent engine]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch6-5.html |title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft; Engines, Large and Small |author1=Courtney G.

A backup navigation tool, the [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|Abort Guidance System]] (AGS), was developed by TRW.\n\n===Design phase===\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|thumb|This 1963 model depicts the second LEM design, which gave rise to informal references as \"the bug\".]]\nThe Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer [[Thomas J.

The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.\n\nAs the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. Egress while wearing bulky [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activity]] (EVA) spacesuits was eased by a simpler forward hatch (32 x 32 inches).\n\nThe configuration was frozen in April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the descent engine was ordered from [[TRW Inc.#Space exploration|Space Technology Laboratories (TRW)]] in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.\n\nPower was initially to be produced by [[fuel cell]]s built by [[Pratt and Whitney]] similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|title=LM Electrical|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201084039/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} -->\n\nThe initial design had three landing legs, the lightest possible configuration. But as any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it landed at a significant angle, this was also the least stable configuration if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain.

Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV's were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, [[Neil Armstrong]].<ref name=\"ugly\">{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LLRV.html|title=LLRV Monograph|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Development flights===\n[[File:67-H-1230 Lunar module LTA-2 R.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 6]] Lunar Module Test Article (LTA-2R) shortly before being mated with the SLA]]\n\nLM-1 was built to make the first uncrewed flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a [[Saturn IB]]. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first crewed flight later that year. But the LM's development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1's flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as [[Apollo 5]]. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.\n\nLM-3 now became the first crewed LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until [[Apollo 9]] on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit crewed practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled to keep the program timeline on track.\n\n[[Apollo 10]] launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a \"dress rehearsal\" for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff.

Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the Command Module ''Columbia'' splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing [[Apollo Program#Background|President John F. Kennedy's goal]]: \"...before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\".\n\nThis was followed by landings by [[Apollo 12]] ''(Intrepid)'' and [[Apollo 14]] ''(Antares)''.[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 11 lunar module ''Eagle'' in lunar orbit]]In April 1970, the [[Apollo 13]] lunar module ''Aquarius'' played an unexpected role in saving the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module|service module]] ruptured, disabling the CSM. ''Aquarius'' served as a \"lifeboat\" for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its [[Descent Propulsion System|descent stage engine]] was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module's batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely on April 17, 1970. The LM's systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including twice depressurization and repressurization causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without depressurization and repressurization and loss of oxygen supply).\n\nHover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a {{convert|9.1|nmi|km|adj=on}} perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach. The CSM would then raise its perilune back to the normal {{convert|60|nmi|km}}.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = McDivitt\n | first = James A.\n | authorlink = James McDivitt\n | title = Apollo 14 Mission Report\n | chapter = 6.

A waste storage tank was added to the descent stage, with plumbing from the ascent stage. These upgrades allowed stays of up to 75 hours on the Moon.\n\nThe [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] was folded up and carried in Quadrant 1 of the descent stage. It was deployed by the astronauts after landing, allowing them to explore large areas and return a greater variety of lunar samples.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Lunar Module diagram.jpg|thumb|Lunar module diagram]]\n[[File:Apollo Lunar Module Inside View.jpg|thumb|Lunar module crew cabin]]\n[[File:Apollo LM crew rest positions.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut rest (sleeping) accommodation]]\n[[File:LM illustration 02.jpg|thumb|Lunar module cutaway illustration]]\nWeights given here are an average for the original pre-ELM spec vehicles.

It contained its own [[Ascent Propulsion System]] (APS) engine and two [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks for return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the [[Apollo command and service module]]. It also contained a Reaction Control System (RCS) for [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[translation (geometry)|translation]] control, which consisted of sixteen hypergolic thrusters similar to those used on the Service Module, mounted in four quads, with their own propellant supply. A forward EVA hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.\n\nInternal equipment included an environmental control (life support) system; a VHF communications system with two antennas for communication with the Command Module; a [[unified S-band]] system and steerable [[parabolic antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] for communication with Earth; an EVA antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts' [[Primary life support system|Portable Life Support System]]s through the LM; [[Apollo PGNCS|primary (PGNCS)]] and [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|backup (AGS)]] guidance and navigation systems; an [[Apollo PGNCS#Optical unit|Alignment Optical Telescope]] for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and an system for active thermal control. Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.\n\nDuring rest periods while parked on the Moon, the crew would sleep on hammocks slung crosswise in the cabin.\n\nThe return payload included the lunar rock and soil samples collected by the crew (as much as {{convert|238|lb|kg}} on Apollo 17), plus their exposed [[photographic film]].\n\n* Crew: 2\n* Crew cabin volume: {{convert|235|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Habitable volume: {{convert|160|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment height: {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment depth: {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Height: {{convert|9|ft|3.5|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width: {{convert|14|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Depth: {{convert|13|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, dry: {{convert|4740|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, gross: {{convert|10300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Atmosphere: 100% oxygen at {{convert|4.8|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}\n* Water: two {{convert|42.5|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tanks\n* Coolant: {{convert|25|lb|kg}} of [[ethylene glycol]] / water solution\n* Thermal Control: one active water-ice sublimator\n* RCS propellant mass: {{convert|633|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* RCS thrusters: sixteen x {{convert|100|lbf|N|abbr=on}} in four quads\n* RCS propellants: [[Aerozine 50]] fuel / [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|nitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) oxidizer\n* RCS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|290|isp}}\n* APS propellant mass: {{convert|5,187|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in two {{convert|36|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=3}} propellant tanks \n* APS engine: [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aerospace]] [[Ascent Propulsion System|LM Ascent Engine]] (LMAE) and [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]] LMAE Injectors\n* APS thrust: {{convert|3,500|lbf|N|abbr=on}} <!-- made consistent with infobox -->\n* APS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* APS pressurant: two {{convert|6.4|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} helium tanks at {{convert|3000|psi|MPa}}\n* APS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|311|isp}}\n* APS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|7,280|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* [[Thrust-to-weight ratio]] at liftoff: 2.124 (in lunar gravity)\n* Batteries: two 28\u201332 volt, 296 [[ampere-hour]] [[Silver-zinc batteries]]; {{convert|125|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n* Power: 28 V DC, 115 V 400&nbsp;Hz AC\n\n===Descent stage===\n[[File:Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module at the [[Euro Space Center]] in Belgium]]\n[[File:Apollo 11 gold reverse.jpeg|thumb|The Lunar Module ''Eagle'' is portrayed on the 2019 United States [[Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins (United States)|Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins]]]]\nThe descent stage's primary job was to support a powered landing and surface extravehicular activity. When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Its octagonal shape was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a [[throttle]]able [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS) engine with four [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks. A [[continuous-wave radar|continuous-wave]] [[Doppler radar]] antenna was mounted by the engine [[heat shield]] on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing. Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized [[Kapton]] foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the \"porch\") in front of the ascent stage's EVA hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin to the surface. The footpad of each landing leg incorporated a {{convert|67|in|m|adj=mid|-long}} surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)\n\nEquipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A [[Lunar Flag Assembly|United States flag]] for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.\n\nThe Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP) (later the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP)), was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that acceptable communications were being received using the LM's S-band antenna, but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 13 and 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions ([[Apollo 15]] and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel.

This would have been launched on an uncrewed Saturn 1B, and docked with a crewed [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]], named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).\n\nThis idea was later transferred to the original [[wet workshop]] design for the ''[[Skylab]]'' orbital workshop and renamed the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] to be docked on a side port of the workshop's multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a \"dry workshop\" design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.\n\n===LM Truck===\nThe Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to {{convert|11000|lb|t}} of payload to the Moon for an uncrewed landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent crewed [[lunar base]]. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the \"truck\" while the orbiting crew returned to Earth.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm Apollo LM Truck on Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215210907/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm |date=2005-12-15 }} \u2013 Description of adapted LM descent stage for the uncrewed transport of cargo to a permanent lunar base.</ref> In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an uncrewed lunar ferry vehicle.\n\n==Depiction in film and television==\nThe 1995 Ron Howard film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', a dramatization of that mission starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Kevin Bacon]], and [[Bill Paxton]], was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the ''Aquarius'' and the Command Module ''Odyssey''.\n\nThe development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|\"Spider\"]]. This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named ''Spider'' after its spidery appearance. The unused LM-13 stood in during the teleplay to depict LM-3 and LM-5, ''Eagle'', used by Apollo 11.\n\n==Media==\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"110px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 1 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (1 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 2 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (2 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Control Displays.jpg|Controls plans\nFile:Lunar Module Landing Gear plans.jpg|Landing Gear plans\n</gallery>\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"350px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Apollo 15 landing on the Moon.ogg|[[Apollo 15]] landing on the Moon seen from the perspective of the Lunar Module Pilot.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe Bay Ridge Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905 and subsequently modified. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Bay Ridge Avenue started on January 24, 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to [[86th Street station (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|86th Street]].
