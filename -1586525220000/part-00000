Van der Vaart finished his [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|first season]] as the team's top scorer as Hamburg finished third in the league and won the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]].\n\nHe assumed the team captaincy for the [[2006\u201307 Bundesliga|2006\u201307 season]]. This season proved to be a difficult one for his club, and despite Van der Vaart's three goals in the Champions League group stages, they made an early exit from the competition, while languishing for several months in the bottom half of the Bundesliga table as Van der Vaart was troubled by injuries throughout the season. The arrival of Van der Vaart's countryman [[Huub Stevens]] as head coach, however, saw Hamburg march up the standings and they finished the season in a respectable seventh place, qualifying for, and also winning, the Intertoto Cup.\n\nAfter garnering interest from [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] from Spain, Van der Vaart responded by saying, \"I am set to spend another season in Hamburg,\" of which he told ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]''.

Despite figuring prominently in a number of qualifying stage matches, Van der Vaart has had a lack of luck when it came to the final tournament. He was however, vice-captain during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] behind [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and [[Mark van Bommel]] respectively. On 15 August 2012, Van der Vaart earned his 100th cap for the Netherlands in the 2\u20134 loss against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a [[friendly match]].\n\nVan der Vaart was used to wear the number 23 or 10 jersey while playing for his country.\n\n===Euro 2004===\nA sub-par performance by the Dutch during their opening game of Euro 2004 persuaded then manager [[Dick Advocaat]] to change the side's formation into one which he felt the talented Van der Vaart did not fit into.

However, niggling injury problems resurfaced, and Van der Vaart was not risked by Dutch coach [[Marco van Basten]] for the opening World Cup encounter against [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]]. With victory in that opening game, the national team coach would once again decide to continue fielding a \"Van der Vaart-less\" lineup. And once again, Van der Vaart was reduced to a bit-part role in the squad although since then he has become a more regular fixture in the starting XI.\n\n===Euro 2008===\n[[File:Rafael van der Vaart Holland.jpg|thumb|Van der Vaart playing for the Netherlands]]\nVan der Vaart was called up for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] despite missing several qualification matches due to an ankle injury.

During an international match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] on 18 August 2004, he was injured by then-Ajax teammate [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]], which led to the sale of Ibrahimovi\u0107 to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] two weeks later, following controversial accusations that the Swede had intentionally tried to hurt Van der Vaart.

He had previously been strongly linked to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], but in the summer of 2005, he signed for [[Bundesliga]] outfit [[Hamburger SV]] in Germany. Van der Vaart's \u20ac5.5&nbsp;million transfer to Hamburg, on 1 June 2005,<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200506/01/eng20050601_187878.html Ajax agrees to transfer midfielder Van der Vaart to Hamburg] ''People's Daily'', 1 June 2005</ref> raised many eyebrows. Many other top-flight clubs had shown interest in the midfielder but he chose Hamburg. Ajax legend Johan Cruyff himself commented in his ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' column, \"I don't know what to say about it or what Rafael van der Vaart is doing in Hamburg.\"<ref name=\"bbc\"/> He played a massive part in Hamburg\u2019s impressive away form that season, scoring in each of their first four games on the road; in fact, in the course of his first one and a half seasons with the German club, they did not lose a single match away from home while he was on the pitch. Van der Vaart finished his [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|first season]] as the team's top scorer as Hamburg finished third in the league and won the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]].\n\nHe assumed the team captaincy for the [[2006\u201307 Bundesliga|2006\u201307 season]]. This season proved to be a difficult one for his club, and despite Van der Vaart's three goals in the Champions League group stages, they made an early exit from the competition, while languishing for several months in the bottom half of the Bundesliga table as Van der Vaart was troubled by injuries throughout the season. The arrival of Van der Vaart's countryman [[Huub Stevens]] as head coach, however, saw Hamburg march up the standings and they finished the season in a respectable seventh place, qualifying for, and also winning, the Intertoto Cup.\n\nAfter garnering interest from [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] from Spain, Van der Vaart responded by saying, \"I am set to spend another season in Hamburg,\" of which he told ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]''. He further added, \"Now we have the team to achieve something.\" In the [[2007\u201308 Bundesliga|2007\u201308 season]], Van der Vaart scored 12 league goals as Hamburg finished fourth in the league, while reaching the round of 16 in the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].

He played in the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]] with present senior teammates [[Maarten Stekelenburg]] and [[John Heitinga]] and former Real Madrid teammates Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Arjen Robben.\n\nThe 18-year-old Van der Vaart then made his senior international debut against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] on 6 October 2001.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Fact file\n |url         = http://www.vandervaartofficial.com/en/fact_file.asp\n |publisher   = Van der Vaart Official\n |accessdate  = 7 August 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080808012253/http://www.vandervaartofficial.com/en/fact_file.asp\n |archivedate = 8 August 2008\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> He was a member of the squads that participated in [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Despite figuring prominently in a number of qualifying stage matches, Van der Vaart has had a lack of luck when it came to the final tournament. He was however, vice-captain during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] behind [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and [[Mark van Bommel]] respectively. On 15 August 2012, Van der Vaart earned his 100th cap for the Netherlands in the 2\u20134 loss against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a [[friendly match]].\n\nVan der Vaart was used to wear the number 23 or 10 jersey while playing for his country.\n\n===Euro 2004===\nA sub-par performance by the Dutch during their opening game of Euro 2004 persuaded then manager [[Dick Advocaat]] to change the side's formation into one which he felt the talented Van der Vaart did not fit into. With Advocaat's new system seemingly working, Van der Vaart would be reduced to play a bit-part role at Euro 2004, as the ''[[Netherlands national football team|Oranje]]'' reached the semi-finals.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nDespite that setback, Van der Vaart produced some superlative performances in the [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] the following season, and it seemed that Van der Vaart's turn to shine on the big stage was to finally come \u2013 at the 2006 World Cup. However, niggling injury problems resurfaced, and Van der Vaart was not risked by Dutch coach [[Marco van Basten]] for the opening World Cup encounter against [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]]. With victory in that opening game, the national team coach would once again decide to continue fielding a \"Van der Vaart-less\" lineup. And once again, Van der Vaart was reduced to a bit-part role in the squad although since then he has become a more regular fixture in the starting XI.\n\n===Euro 2008===\n[[File:Rafael van der Vaart Holland.jpg|thumb|Van der Vaart playing for the Netherlands]]\nVan der Vaart was called up for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] despite missing several qualification matches due to an ankle injury. As Van Basten had decided to change their formation to 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, Van der Vaart was deployed in the midfield along with Wesley Sneijder and either [[Dirk Kuyt]] or [[Robin van Persie]], behind lone striker [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] to great effect. In the opening game of the competition, the Dutch team won 3\u20130 against the world champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] with Van der Vaart playing a role in the build-ups. Van Basten decided to field him again in the starting line-up in the next match against [[France national football team|France]]; the ''Oranje'' later went on to win 4\u20131.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\nDespite enduring a tough time at club level,<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jlD8z-ewcG54rIwdeNIZfeK69GVg Battler Van der Vaart out of Real shadows] AFP, 4 July 2010</ref> Van der Vaart remained a first-choice player for Van Basten's successor [[Bert van Marwijk]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifying|2010 World Cup qualifiers]].

It is approximately {{convert|260|mi}} long.\n\nIt is one of the few \"old\" trunk routes not to have been superseded by a direct [[motorway]] link. The eastern section from [[Denham, Buckinghamshire]] to [[Wheatley, Oxfordshire]] is better served by the [[M40 motorway|M40]].\n\n==History==\nThe A40 1923 route was from the [[City of London]] to Fishguard. The road still begins and ends in the same places, but a number of changes have been made to its route.<ref>[http://www.road-to-nowhere.co.uk/route-guides/A40.htm]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Road to Nowhere: A40 Ross-on-Wye to Abergavenny</ref>\n\nThe first change dates from 1935, between [[Ross-on-Wye]] and [[Abergavenny]].  The original route of the A40 was via [[Skenfrith]]; this road was renumbered the B4521. The A40 was rerouted via [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]]; between Ross and Raglan it replaced part of the A48, between Raglan and Llanvihangel-nigh-Usk it replaced the B4234, and between Llanvihangel and Abergavenny it replaced part of the A471.\n\nSubsequently, the A40 was rerouted within west London.  Western Avenue dates from the 1930s, but was originally opened as the A403.  After the Second World War, the A40 was rerouted along part of the A219 (west of Notting Hill) and Western Avenue.  The old route (via Acton, Ealing, Southall, Hayes, Hillingdon and Uxbridge) was renumbered the A4020.\n\nInitially, the A40 went through the centre of Oxford, via [[Headington]], [[Magdalen Bridge]], the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]], [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]] and [[Botley, Oxfordshire|Botley]], and over the [[Swinford Toll Bridge]] to [[Eynsham]].  It was rerouted in the 1930s to follow the first section of the [[Oxford ring road]] to the north of the city, and then followed a direct line to [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] Eynsham.  The old route became part of the [[A420 road|A420]] to Botley, and the section between Botley and Eynsham was renumbered the A4141,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/series?xCenter=3249330.6417157&yCenter=2830691.8632341&scale=63360&viewScale=181417.4208&mapLayer=europe&subLayer=new_pop&title=British%20War%20Office%20GSGS%204127%2C%20Ordnance%20Survey%20Popular%20and%20New%20Popular%20Editions&download=true|title=New Popular Edition, Sheet 158|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey of Great Britain]]|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref> renumbered again in the 1960s to the B4044.\n\n==Route==\n===Central London - Denham===\n{{main|A40 road in London}}\nIn central London it is [[Holborn|High Holborn]] and then [[Oxford Street]]. At [[Marble Arch]] it joins the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] [[Edgware Road]] as far as the Marylebone Flyover to become [[Westway (London)|Westway]]; formerly classified A40(M) as an elevated motorway; it is now an A-road. It takes the A40 to meet [[Western Avenue, London|Western Avenue]]. For the greater part, this section is six lanes, otherwise four lanes. With two exceptions, Western Avenue forms a grade-separated motorway standard dual-carriageway between Paddington and the [[M40 motorway]]. The two [[at-grade intersection]]s are Gypsy Corner and Savoy Circus; both of which are [[traffic light]] controlled. At [[Denham Roundabout]], the six lane Western Avenue flows into the [[M40 motorway|M40]].\n\n=== Denham - Oxford ===\nThe A40 branches off the Denham roundabout to run as a dual carriageway. After the junction with the [[A413 road|A413]], the A40 follows the same route as the M40 as a  single carriageway,  passing through [[Beaconsfield]] and [[High Wycombe]]. Beyond [[Stokenchurch]] the road is much quieter; when meeting the B4009 and A329 those roads have priority. Approaching [[Oxford]], the A40 becomes a busy dual carriageway, carrying traffic from the M40 to Oxford and beyond. The road forms the northern section of the [[Oxford Ring Road]], crossing the [[A44 road|A44]] and the [[A34 road|A34]].\n\n===Oxford - Cheltenham (M5)===\nThe A40 passes under the [[A34 road (England)|A34]], reverting to single carriageway for {{convert|10|mi}} until the dual carriageway past [[Witney]] with a grade-separated junction. The dual carriageway finishes at a roundabout. For the rest of [[Oxfordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]] until [[Cheltenham]], other than for a few short stretches, the road is single carriageway. This section has the highest point of the entire A40 which is {{convert|820|ft}} above sea level, located {{convert|3|mi}} west of the A429 junction. Before [[Andoversford]] the [[A436 road (Great Britain)|A436]] breaks off to the west to try to take traffic away from descending into the centre of Cheltenham itself. The road travels through Cheltenham town centre along at least two parallel routes (neither is part of a one-way system: Sandford Road and Montpellier Terrace make up one part, Thirlestaine Road and Suffolk Road the other). Becoming a dual carriageway, it passes [[GCHQ]] in Cheltenham and the three-level stacked roundabout junction with the [[M5 motorway]]. In February 2015, the Witney Oxford Transport Group proposed the reopening of [[Yarnton railway station]] as an alternative to improvements to the A40 road proposed by [[Oxfordshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Elvery |first=Martin |url=http://www.witneygazette.co.uk/news/11771480.Campaigners_want_new_railway_station_at_Yarnton_to_ease_A40_congestion/?ref=mr |title= Campaigners want new railway station at Yarnton to ease A40 congestion in West Oxfordshire |work=Witney Gazette |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordshireguardian.co.uk/bid-to-reopen-train-track-ahead-of-key-rail-summit/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923041805/http://www.oxfordshireguardian.co.uk/bid-to-reopen-train-track-ahead-of-key-rail-summit/ |archive-date=23 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Cheltenham (M5) - Abergavenny===\nThe A40 is the [[Gloucester]] bypass, most of which is dual carriageway. The junction with the [[A48 road|A48]] to [[Chepstow]] is at Highnam. For the remainder of Gloucestershire, and a part of [[Herefordshire]], the road is single carriageway until [[Ross-on-Wye]]. There it connects with the [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50 motorway]], and forms part of the high quality dual carriageway between South Wales and the [[English Midlands]]. From Ross-on-Wye to [[Monmouth]] the road follows the [[Wye Valley]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], crossing the [[Wales\u2013England border]] a mile east of Monmouth. Just west of Monmouth are twin tunnels; these are the only tunnels on the A40. Near [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]], the A40 has a grade separated junction with the [[A449 road|A449]]. The A40 continues as a dual carriageway to [[Abergavenny]].\n\n====Abergavenny - M50 junctions====\n{| border=1 cellpadding=2 style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: black; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#00703C\" style=\"color: #ffd200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''A40 (T)''' \n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''Eastbound exits'''\n| '''Junction'''\n| '''Westbound exits'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| [[The MIDLANDS]] [[Worcester]] ('''[[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]]''') <br> [[Ross-on-Wye]]\n| ''Roundabout''\n| Ross-on-Wye <br> The MIDLANDS Worcester ('''M50''')\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Hereford]] '''[[A49 road (England)|A49]]''' <br> Ross-on-Wye '''B4260'''\n| Wilton Roundabout\n| Ross-on-Wye '''B4260''' <br> Hereford '''A49'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Goodrich, Herefordshire|Goodrich]]\n| Goodrich Junction\n| Goodrich\n|-align=\"center\"\n| Hereford '''[[A4137 road|A4137]]''' <br> Goodrich '''B4229'''\n| Old Ross Road Junction\n| Hereford '''A4137''' <br> Goodrich '''B4229'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Whitchurch, Herefordshire|Whitchurch]], [[Symond's Yat]] (West)\n| Whitchurch Junction\n| Whitchurch, Symond's Yat (West)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| {{no2}}Exit only <br> Whitchurch\n| Whitchurch South Junction\n| {{no2}}No exit or access\n|- align=\"center\"\n| {{no2}} No exit or access\n| Oak House Junction\n| Crocker's Ash, Doward\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Monmouth]] '''[[A466]]''' <br> [[Chepstow]] ('''A466'''), [[Forest of Dean]] ('''A4136''') '''A40'''\n| Old Dixon Roundabout\n| Monmouth '''A466'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| Monmouth '''A466'''\n| Wye Bridge Junction\n| Chepstow ('''A466'''), Forest of Dean ('''A4136''')\n|-align=\"center\"\n| Monmouth, [[Trelleck]] '''B4293'''\n| Monnow Bridge Junction\n| Monmouth, [[Trelleck]] '''B4293'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| {{no2}}No access or exit\n| Mitchel Troy Junction\n| {{no2}}Access only\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] '''[[A449]]'''\n| Raglan Interchange\n| Newport, [[Cardiff]] ('''[[M4 motorway|M4]]''') '''A449'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Abergavenny]] ('''A40'''), [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]], [[Mitchel Troy]]\n| Raglan Junction\n| Raglan <br> Mitchel Troy, [[Dingestow]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Clytha]] <br> Raglan <br> [[Gwehelog]]\n| Raglan Roundabout\n| Raglan <br> Gwehelog <br> Clytha\n|- align=\"center\"\n| [[Hereford]] '''[[A465]]''' <br> [[Usk]], Clytha '''B4598'''\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Ysbytty Fields Roundabout\n| {{no2}}No access or exit\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Newport '''[[A4042]]''' <br> [[Merthyr Tydfil]] '''A465''' \n| Newport '''A4042'''<br> Merthyr Tydfil '''A465''' <br> Hereford '''A465'''\n|}\n\n===Abergavenny - Carmarthen===\nAt Abergavenny is the A40 junction with the Heads of the Valleys road, ([[A465 road|A465]]) and the A4042. Now the A465 becomes the primary route between the Midlands to the [[South Wales Valleys]] and Swansea; there is a dual-carriageway route to [[Carmarthen]] via the A465, M4 and A48.\n\nThe A40 becomes single carriageway and continues through Abergavenny, following the north side of the [[River Usk|Usk valley]] through the eastern part of the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]] until [[Brecon]]. At [[Bwlch]] between Abergavenny and Brecon, the A40 is {{convert|660|ft}} above sea level. The A40 is dualled for over {{convert|1.5|mi}} as it approaches a junction east of Brecon with the [[A470_road|A470]] north, which is the main north-south road through mid-Wales. Continuing as a dual carriageway, the A40 and A470 concurrent bypass Brecon to the south, crossing the River Usk here. At the western end of the bypass is a further junction with the A470 south.  Beyond this point the A40 continues as a single carriageway, now south of the River Usk, and roughly follows the northern edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park. In [[Llandovery]] the road crosses the [[Heart of Wales line|Heart of Wales railway]] and the [[River Tywi]]; the road, railway and river then run parallel until [[Llandeilo]], where the National Park ends and the railway turns south. The A40 continues west along the Tywi valley to Carmarthen where as a dual carriageway it forms the eastern bypass, meeting the terminus of the A48 at Pensarn. Here the A40 returns to being a primary route westwards.\n\n===Carmarthen - Fishguard===\nAt Carmarthen the A40 crosses the [[River Tywi]] twice with two 90-degree junctions and continues on {{convert|10|mi}} of dual carriageway as far as [[St. Clears]], where the dual carriageway ends at the junction with the [[A477 road|A477]] [[trunk road]]. Now the A40 is a mixture of 2 or 3 lane single-carriageway to [[Haverfordwest]] and [[Fishguard]]. This section of road is controlled by the [[Welsh Government]] (formerly 'Welsh Assembly Government'), which describes it as \"one of the lowest standard sections of the Trans European Road Network in the United Kingdom\".<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">[http://wales.gov.uk/docs/det/policy/060825A40.pdf Welsh Assembly Government]</ref>\n\n'''St Clears to Haverfordwest dualling'''\nThere were plans in 2002 for a major improvement of the 23-mile stretch between St Clears and Haverfordwest which included upgrading to a dual carriageway; described as an extension of the national motorway network to the West Wales coast by virtue of the route from the [[M4 motorway|M4]] motorway being entirely dual carriageway.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1885220.stm| title=Dual carriageway for west Wales| work=BBC News| date=2002-03-21}}</ref> The \u00a360&nbsp;million scheme was subject to a European Environmental Assessment.  Within a couple of years, the project appeared to be dying a very quiet death, causing local newspapers to report it being an election stunt for the two marginal constituencies that would best benefit from the improvements.  The following Welsh elections saw both constituencies change the party of majority.  The political party at the centre of the row instead directed the project deferment to damning environmental statements by Friends of the Earth Cymru.<ref>[http://www.foe.co.uk/cymru/english/press_releases/a40_safety_challenged.html A40 dual carriageway safety claim challenged]</ref><ref>[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/proposed_a40_dualling.pdf FOE Briefing]</ref> The scheme was officially scrapped in 2008 after a Welsh Assembly committee decided to abandon the proposals.  Instead, it recommended upgrades to the existing route including bypasses around [[Robeston Wathen]] and [[Llanddewi Velfrey]] using a three-lane option.  This was welcomed by the [[Friends of the Earth]], saying \"The dual carriageway on the A40 would increase traffic levels, increase the emission of greenhouse gases, it would be harmful for the environment, it would be hugely expensive. That money would be better spent on improving public transport, on health, on education, there's no need for it. We think the assembly committee has come to the right decision\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/wales_politics/7765939.stm|title=A40 dual carriageway plan blocked|work=BBC News|date=2008-12-04}}</ref>\n\n'''Whitland Bypass'''\nThe last improvement to the A40 on this section prior to the Welsh Assembly Government having the devolved responsibility for this road was a {{convert|4.1|km}} \u00a38&nbsp;million bypass around [[Whitland]].  Constructed in 1994, the road started east of Black Bridge on the original A40, then running north of the town before to a new roundabout just west of Llain Cottage.  The Secretary of State for Wales was asked a written question by [[Rhodri Morgan]] about adding a second carriageway to the Whitland bypass scheme, to which [[John Redwood]] replied \"There are no proposals to add a second carriageway to the Whitland bypass. The design capacity of a single carriageway two-lane highway is more than adequate to cater with the anticipated traffic flows for the foreseeable future.\"<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1995/feb/03/whitland-bypass Hansard]</ref>\n\n'''Llanddewi Velfrey Bypass'''\nA new bypass has been granted approval by the Welsh Assembly Government at [[Llanddewi Velfrey]] in [[Pembrokeshire]].  The scheme would improve the A40 between [[Llanddewi Velfrey]] and [[Penblewin]], to the west of St Clears and meet the aim of the targeted investment in infrastructure along the east-west road corridor in south Wales.<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/topics/transport/roads/schemes/ewsouth/a40llanddewi Welsh Assembly Government]</ref> From the east, it is proposed that a roundabout would be created just north of Glenfield Farm, where the straight section from St Clears ends at Bethel Chapel, and then take a new route north-west of the town of Llanddewi Velfrey, south-west over Pentroydin Fawr and Penttroydin Fech farms with cattle underpasses, a new underpass beneath the existing Llanddewi Velfrey to [[Llanfallteg]] road, before going over the original A40 at [[Ffynnon Wood]].  To the west of Ffynnon Wood, the road would then cross back over the original A40 to the east of [[Henllan Lodge]] in a way to maintain the tree lined avenue to Henllan, then run parallel to the A40 on the north side of the existing A40 to a new roundabout at Penblewin and the junction with the [[A478 road|A478]].<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/docs/det/policy/060825A40routemap.pdf Llanddewi Velfrey Bypass Route (Welsh Assembly Government]</ref>\n\nThis was originally known as the Blue and Purple routes during the Consultation in 2006<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/docs/det/policy/060825A40.pdf A40 Llanddewi Velfrey to Penblewin Public Consultation]</ref> for which 75% preferred the blue route, and only 20% preferred the red route.  54% felt the section from Ffynnon Wood and Penblewin Roundabout needed improvement, with both orange and purple routes preferred by 42% of the respondents.  [[Dwr Cymru|Welsh Water/Dwr Cymru]] expressed concerns with the red route affecting water mains and sewers, and Henllanfallteg Community Council felt the red route would not improve the quality of life in Llanddewi Velfrey.  [[Pembrokeshire County Council]] expressed concerns that the route planned was a single carriageway, and that within seven years, a dual carriageway would be required.\n\n'''Robeston Wathen Bypass'''\nA new bypass has been constructed between Penblewin and Slebech Park making the road straighter and with a '2+1' road layout to help improve overtaking opportunities.<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/transport/2011/110316penblewin/?lang=en Welsh Assembly Government: Penblewin Improvements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330110008/http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/transport/2011/110316penblewin/?lang=en |date=30 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nStarting to the west of Toch Lane (approx. {{convert|2|km}} east of [[Slebech]]), the route travels eastwards for {{convert|4.6|km}}, passing {{convert|200|m}} south of [[Robeston Wathen]], and ending {{convert|0.5|km}} east of the village, just west of Flimstone Lane.\n\nConstruction started on the route in February 2009, with the works completed and the new road opening 1 March 2011.  The road was built by [[Costain]].  The scheme was nearly \u00a314&nbsp;million over the initial budget of \u00a327.6&nbsp;million, eventually costing \u00a341.4&nbsp;million.  The Welsh Assembly Government explains this increase as being the result of inflation and land costs, saying the original budget did not include either, as well as additional statutory procedures, additional works following some design standards, and the increase in VAT.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12756563|title=Over-budget Penblewin to Slebech Park bypass opens|date=2011-03-16 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n'''The Kell'''\nThe Kell is located on a section of the A40 that forms a north-south corridor between [[Fishguard]], {{convert|17|km}} to the north and [[Haverfordwest]], {{convert|7.5|km}} to the south, close to [[Treffgarne]] and [[Spittal, Pembrokeshire|Spittal]]. The improvement saw about {{convert|0.48|km}} of new trunk road commencing at a point on the trunk road approximately 622 metres south of the centreline of the junction of the A40 trunk road with the C3059 road to Spittal and extending in a generally northerly direction to a point approximately 112 metres south of the junction of the trunk road with the C3059 road to Spittal.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2009/3192/pdfs/wsi_20093192_mi.pdf Statutory Instrument 3192 (2009)]</ref> This resulted in the road being rerouted through pasture to the east of the original road, taking a right hand bend about {{convert|160|m}} south of The Old Mill, taking a 5.5% gradient, and rejoining the original road {{convert|210|m}} north of The Kell.  The original road has subsequently been converted to an access road for The Old Mill, Beavers Lodge and The Kell, accessing the new road at The Old Mill.\n\n'''Fishguard Bypass'''\nThe Fishguard Bypass was planned to provide a more direct route with greater capacity to the Port of Fishguard at Goodwick avoiding the town centre of Fishguard. It was constructed during the late 1990s and opened in 2000. It takes the form of a three-lane carriageway on an approx. 10% gradient around the western edge of Fishguard. It runs from its highest point at Rafael roundabout 1&nbsp;km south of Fishguard town in a generally northerly direction to its lowest point at Windy Hall roundabout where it rejoins the old A40 route at Gasworks Hill.

It is approximately {{convert|260|mi}} long.\n\nIt is one of the few \"old\" trunk routes not to have been superseded by a direct [[motorway]] link. The eastern section from [[Denham, Buckinghamshire]] to [[Wheatley, Oxfordshire]] is better served by the [[M40 motorway|M40]].\n\n==History==\nThe A40 1923 route was from the [[City of London]] to Fishguard. The road still begins and ends in the same places, but a number of changes have been made to its route.<ref>[http://www.road-to-nowhere.co.uk/route-guides/A40.htm]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Road to Nowhere: A40 Ross-on-Wye to Abergavenny</ref>\n\nThe first change dates from 1935, between [[Ross-on-Wye]] and [[Abergavenny]].  The original route of the A40 was via [[Skenfrith]]; this road was renumbered the B4521. The A40 was rerouted via [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]]; between Ross and Raglan it replaced part of the A48, between Raglan and Llanvihangel-nigh-Usk it replaced the B4234, and between Llanvihangel and Abergavenny it replaced part of the A471.\n\nSubsequently, the A40 was rerouted within west London.  Western Avenue dates from the 1930s, but was originally opened as the A403.  After the Second World War, the A40 was rerouted along part of the A219 (west of Notting Hill) and Western Avenue.  The old route (via Acton, Ealing, Southall, Hayes, Hillingdon and Uxbridge) was renumbered the A4020.\n\nInitially, the A40 went through the centre of Oxford, via [[Headington]], [[Magdalen Bridge]], the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]], [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]] and [[Botley, Oxfordshire|Botley]], and over the [[Swinford Toll Bridge]] to [[Eynsham]].  It was rerouted in the 1930s to follow the first section of the [[Oxford ring road]] to the north of the city, and then followed a direct line to [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] Eynsham.  The old route became part of the [[A420 road|A420]] to Botley, and the section between Botley and Eynsham was renumbered the A4141,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/series?xCenter=3249330.6417157&yCenter=2830691.8632341&scale=63360&viewScale=181417.4208&mapLayer=europe&subLayer=new_pop&title=British%20War%20Office%20GSGS%204127%2C%20Ordnance%20Survey%20Popular%20and%20New%20Popular%20Editions&download=true|title=New Popular Edition, Sheet 158|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey of Great Britain]]|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref> renumbered again in the 1960s to the B4044.\n\n==Route==\n===Central London - Denham===\n{{main|A40 road in London}}\nIn central London it is [[Holborn|High Holborn]] and then [[Oxford Street]]. At [[Marble Arch]] it joins the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] [[Edgware Road]] as far as the Marylebone Flyover to become [[Westway (London)|Westway]]; formerly classified A40(M) as an elevated motorway; it is now an A-road. It takes the A40 to meet [[Western Avenue, London|Western Avenue]]. For the greater part, this section is six lanes, otherwise four lanes. With two exceptions, Western Avenue forms a grade-separated motorway standard dual-carriageway between Paddington and the [[M40 motorway]]. The two [[at-grade intersection]]s are Gypsy Corner and Savoy Circus; both of which are [[traffic light]] controlled. At [[Denham Roundabout]], the six lane Western Avenue flows into the [[M40 motorway|M40]].\n\n=== Denham - Oxford ===\nThe A40 branches off the Denham roundabout to run as a dual carriageway. After the junction with the [[A413 road|A413]], the A40 follows the same route as the M40 as a  single carriageway,  passing through [[Beaconsfield]] and [[High Wycombe]]. Beyond [[Stokenchurch]] the road is much quieter; when meeting the B4009 and A329 those roads have priority. Approaching [[Oxford]], the A40 becomes a busy dual carriageway, carrying traffic from the M40 to Oxford and beyond. The road forms the northern section of the [[Oxford Ring Road]], crossing the [[A44 road|A44]] and the [[A34 road|A34]].\n\n===Oxford - Cheltenham (M5)===\nThe A40 passes under the [[A34 road (England)|A34]], reverting to single carriageway for {{convert|10|mi}} until the dual carriageway past [[Witney]] with a grade-separated junction. The dual carriageway finishes at a roundabout. For the rest of [[Oxfordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]] until [[Cheltenham]], other than for a few short stretches, the road is single carriageway. This section has the highest point of the entire A40 which is {{convert|820|ft}} above sea level, located {{convert|3|mi}} west of the A429 junction. Before [[Andoversford]] the [[A436 road (Great Britain)|A436]] breaks off to the west to try to take traffic away from descending into the centre of Cheltenham itself. The road travels through Cheltenham town centre along at least two parallel routes (neither is part of a one-way system: Sandford Road and Montpellier Terrace make up one part, Thirlestaine Road and Suffolk Road the other). Becoming a dual carriageway, it passes [[GCHQ]] in Cheltenham and the three-level stacked roundabout junction with the [[M5 motorway]]. In February 2015, the Witney Oxford Transport Group proposed the reopening of [[Yarnton railway station]] as an alternative to improvements to the A40 road proposed by [[Oxfordshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Elvery |first=Martin |url=http://www.witneygazette.co.uk/news/11771480.Campaigners_want_new_railway_station_at_Yarnton_to_ease_A40_congestion/?ref=mr |title= Campaigners want new railway station at Yarnton to ease A40 congestion in West Oxfordshire |work=Witney Gazette |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordshireguardian.co.uk/bid-to-reopen-train-track-ahead-of-key-rail-summit/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923041805/http://www.oxfordshireguardian.co.uk/bid-to-reopen-train-track-ahead-of-key-rail-summit/ |archive-date=23 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Cheltenham (M5) - Abergavenny===\nThe A40 is the [[Gloucester]] bypass, most of which is dual carriageway. The junction with the [[A48 road|A48]] to [[Chepstow]] is at Highnam. For the remainder of Gloucestershire, and a part of [[Herefordshire]], the road is single carriageway until [[Ross-on-Wye]]. There it connects with the [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50 motorway]], and forms part of the high quality dual carriageway between South Wales and the [[English Midlands]]. From Ross-on-Wye to [[Monmouth]] the road follows the [[Wye Valley]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], crossing the [[Wales\u2013England border]] a mile east of Monmouth. Just west of Monmouth are twin tunnels; these are the only tunnels on the A40. Near [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]], the A40 has a grade separated junction with the [[A449 road|A449]]. The A40 continues as a dual carriageway to [[Abergavenny]].\n\n====Abergavenny - M50 junctions====\n{| border=1 cellpadding=2 style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: black; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#00703C\" style=\"color: #ffd200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''A40 (T)''' \n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''Eastbound exits'''\n| '''Junction'''\n| '''Westbound exits'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| [[The MIDLANDS]] [[Worcester]] ('''[[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]]''') <br> [[Ross-on-Wye]]\n| ''Roundabout''\n| Ross-on-Wye <br> The MIDLANDS Worcester ('''M50''')\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Hereford]] '''[[A49 road (England)|A49]]''' <br> Ross-on-Wye '''B4260'''\n| Wilton Roundabout\n| Ross-on-Wye '''B4260''' <br> Hereford '''A49'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Goodrich, Herefordshire|Goodrich]]\n| Goodrich Junction\n| Goodrich\n|-align=\"center\"\n| Hereford '''[[A4137 road|A4137]]''' <br> Goodrich '''B4229'''\n| Old Ross Road Junction\n| Hereford '''A4137''' <br> Goodrich '''B4229'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Whitchurch, Herefordshire|Whitchurch]], [[Symond's Yat]] (West)\n| Whitchurch Junction\n| Whitchurch, Symond's Yat (West)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| {{no2}}Exit only <br> Whitchurch\n| Whitchurch South Junction\n| {{no2}}No exit or access\n|- align=\"center\"\n| {{no2}} No exit or access\n| Oak House Junction\n| Crocker's Ash, Doward\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Monmouth]] '''[[A466]]''' <br> [[Chepstow]] ('''A466'''), [[Forest of Dean]] ('''A4136''') '''A40'''\n| Old Dixon Roundabout\n| Monmouth '''A466'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| Monmouth '''A466'''\n| Wye Bridge Junction\n| Chepstow ('''A466'''), Forest of Dean ('''A4136''')\n|-align=\"center\"\n| Monmouth, [[Trelleck]] '''B4293'''\n| Monnow Bridge Junction\n| Monmouth, [[Trelleck]] '''B4293'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| {{no2}}No access or exit\n| Mitchel Troy Junction\n| {{no2}}Access only\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] '''[[A449]]'''\n| Raglan Interchange\n| Newport, [[Cardiff]] ('''[[M4 motorway|M4]]''') '''A449'''\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Abergavenny]] ('''A40'''), [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]], [[Mitchel Troy]]\n| Raglan Junction\n| Raglan <br> Mitchel Troy, [[Dingestow]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n| [[Clytha]] <br> Raglan <br> [[Gwehelog]]\n| Raglan Roundabout\n| Raglan <br> Gwehelog <br> Clytha\n|- align=\"center\"\n| [[Hereford]] '''[[A465]]''' <br> [[Usk]], Clytha '''B4598'''\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Ysbytty Fields Roundabout\n| {{no2}}No access or exit\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Newport '''[[A4042]]''' <br> [[Merthyr Tydfil]] '''A465''' \n| Newport '''A4042'''<br> Merthyr Tydfil '''A465''' <br> Hereford '''A465'''\n|}\n\n===Abergavenny - Carmarthen===\nAt Abergavenny is the A40 junction with the Heads of the Valleys road, ([[A465 road|A465]]) and the A4042. Now the A465 becomes the primary route between the Midlands to the [[South Wales Valleys]] and Swansea; there is a dual-carriageway route to [[Carmarthen]] via the A465, M4 and A48.\n\nThe A40 becomes single carriageway and continues through Abergavenny, following the north side of the [[River Usk|Usk valley]] through the eastern part of the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]] until [[Brecon]]. At [[Bwlch]] between Abergavenny and Brecon, the A40 is {{convert|660|ft}} above sea level. The A40 is dualled for over {{convert|1.5|mi}} as it approaches a junction east of Brecon with the [[A470_road|A470]] north, which is the main north-south road through mid-Wales. Continuing as a dual carriageway, the A40 and A470 concurrent bypass Brecon to the south, crossing the River Usk here. At the western end of the bypass is a further junction with the A470 south.  Beyond this point the A40 continues as a single carriageway, now south of the River Usk, and roughly follows the northern edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park. In [[Llandovery]] the road crosses the [[Heart of Wales line|Heart of Wales railway]] and the [[River Tywi]]; the road, railway and river then run parallel until [[Llandeilo]], where the National Park ends and the railway turns south. The A40 continues west along the Tywi valley to Carmarthen where as a dual carriageway it forms the eastern bypass, meeting the terminus of the A48 at Pensarn. Here the A40 returns to being a primary route westwards.\n\n===Carmarthen - Fishguard===\nAt Carmarthen the A40 crosses the [[River Tywi]] twice with two 90-degree junctions and continues on {{convert|10|mi}} of dual carriageway as far as [[St. Clears]], where the dual carriageway ends at the junction with the [[A477 road|A477]] [[trunk road]]. Now the A40 is a mixture of 2 or 3 lane single-carriageway to [[Haverfordwest]] and [[Fishguard]]. This section of road is controlled by the [[Welsh Government]] (formerly 'Welsh Assembly Government'), which describes it as \"one of the lowest standard sections of the Trans European Road Network in the United Kingdom\".<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">[http://wales.gov.uk/docs/det/policy/060825A40.pdf Welsh Assembly Government]</ref>\n\n'''St Clears to Haverfordwest dualling'''\nThere were plans in 2002 for a major improvement of the 23-mile stretch between St Clears and Haverfordwest which included upgrading to a dual carriageway; described as an extension of the national motorway network to the West Wales coast by virtue of the route from the [[M4 motorway|M4]] motorway being entirely dual carriageway.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1885220.stm| title=Dual carriageway for west Wales| work=BBC News| date=2002-03-21}}</ref> The \u00a360&nbsp;million scheme was subject to a European Environmental Assessment.  Within a couple of years, the project appeared to be dying a very quiet death, causing local newspapers to report it being an election stunt for the two marginal constituencies that would best benefit from the improvements.  The following Welsh elections saw both constituencies change the party of majority.  The political party at the centre of the row instead directed the project deferment to damning environmental statements by Friends of the Earth Cymru.<ref>[http://www.foe.co.uk/cymru/english/press_releases/a40_safety_challenged.html A40 dual carriageway safety claim challenged]</ref><ref>[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/proposed_a40_dualling.pdf FOE Briefing]</ref> The scheme was officially scrapped in 2008 after a Welsh Assembly committee decided to abandon the proposals.  Instead, it recommended upgrades to the existing route including bypasses around [[Robeston Wathen]] and [[Llanddewi Velfrey]] using a three-lane option.  This was welcomed by the [[Friends of the Earth]], saying \"The dual carriageway on the A40 would increase traffic levels, increase the emission of greenhouse gases, it would be harmful for the environment, it would be hugely expensive. That money would be better spent on improving public transport, on health, on education, there's no need for it. We think the assembly committee has come to the right decision\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/wales_politics/7765939.stm|title=A40 dual carriageway plan blocked|work=BBC News|date=2008-12-04}}</ref>\n\n'''Whitland Bypass'''\nThe last improvement to the A40 on this section prior to the Welsh Assembly Government having the devolved responsibility for this road was a {{convert|4.1|km}} \u00a38&nbsp;million bypass around [[Whitland]].  Constructed in 1994, the road started east of Black Bridge on the original A40, then running north of the town before to a new roundabout just west of Llain Cottage.  The Secretary of State for Wales was asked a written question by [[Rhodri Morgan]] about adding a second carriageway to the Whitland bypass scheme, to which [[John Redwood]] replied \"There are no proposals to add a second carriageway to the Whitland bypass. The design capacity of a single carriageway two-lane highway is more than adequate to cater with the anticipated traffic flows for the foreseeable future.\"<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1995/feb/03/whitland-bypass Hansard]</ref>\n\n'''Llanddewi Velfrey Bypass'''\nA new bypass has been granted approval by the Welsh Assembly Government at [[Llanddewi Velfrey]] in [[Pembrokeshire]].  The scheme would improve the A40 between [[Llanddewi Velfrey]] and [[Penblewin]], to the west of St Clears and meet the aim of the targeted investment in infrastructure along the east-west road corridor in south Wales.<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/topics/transport/roads/schemes/ewsouth/a40llanddewi Welsh Assembly Government]</ref> From the east, it is proposed that a roundabout would be created just north of Glenfield Farm, where the straight section from St Clears ends at Bethel Chapel, and then take a new route north-west of the town of Llanddewi Velfrey, south-west over Pentroydin Fawr and Penttroydin Fech farms with cattle underpasses, a new underpass beneath the existing Llanddewi Velfrey to [[Llanfallteg]] road, before going over the original A40 at [[Ffynnon Wood]].  To the west of Ffynnon Wood, the road would then cross back over the original A40 to the east of [[Henllan Lodge]] in a way to maintain the tree lined avenue to Henllan, then run parallel to the A40 on the north side of the existing A40 to a new roundabout at Penblewin and the junction with the [[A478 road|A478]].<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/docs/det/policy/060825A40routemap.pdf Llanddewi Velfrey Bypass Route (Welsh Assembly Government]</ref>\n\nThis was originally known as the Blue and Purple routes during the Consultation in 2006<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/docs/det/policy/060825A40.pdf A40 Llanddewi Velfrey to Penblewin Public Consultation]</ref> for which 75% preferred the blue route, and only 20% preferred the red route.  54% felt the section from Ffynnon Wood and Penblewin Roundabout needed improvement, with both orange and purple routes preferred by 42% of the respondents.  [[Dwr Cymru|Welsh Water/Dwr Cymru]] expressed concerns with the red route affecting water mains and sewers, and Henllanfallteg Community Council felt the red route would not improve the quality of life in Llanddewi Velfrey.  [[Pembrokeshire County Council]] expressed concerns that the route planned was a single carriageway, and that within seven years, a dual carriageway would be required.\n\n'''Robeston Wathen Bypass'''\nA new bypass has been constructed between Penblewin and Slebech Park making the road straighter and with a '2+1' road layout to help improve overtaking opportunities.<ref>[http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/transport/2011/110316penblewin/?lang=en Welsh Assembly Government: Penblewin Improvements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330110008/http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/transport/2011/110316penblewin/?lang=en |date=30 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nStarting to the west of Toch Lane (approx. {{convert|2|km}} east of [[Slebech]]), the route travels eastwards for {{convert|4.6|km}}, passing {{convert|200|m}} south of [[Robeston Wathen]], and ending {{convert|0.5|km}} east of the village, just west of Flimstone Lane.\n\nConstruction started on the route in February 2009, with the works completed and the new road opening 1 March 2011.  The road was built by [[Costain]].  The scheme was nearly \u00a314&nbsp;million over the initial budget of \u00a327.6&nbsp;million, eventually costing \u00a341.4&nbsp;million.  The Welsh Assembly Government explains this increase as being the result of inflation and land costs, saying the original budget did not include either, as well as additional statutory procedures, additional works following some design standards, and the increase in VAT.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12756563|title=Over-budget Penblewin to Slebech Park bypass opens|date=2011-03-16 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n'''The Kell'''\nThe Kell is located on a section of the A40 that forms a north-south corridor between [[Fishguard]], {{convert|17|km}} to the north and [[Haverfordwest]], {{convert|7.5|km}} to the south, close to [[Treffgarne]] and [[Spittal, Pembrokeshire|Spittal]]. The improvement saw about {{convert|0.48|km}} of new trunk road commencing at a point on the trunk road approximately 622 metres south of the centreline of the junction of the A40 trunk road with the C3059 road to Spittal and extending in a generally northerly direction to a point approximately 112 metres south of the junction of the trunk road with the C3059 road to Spittal.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2009/3192/pdfs/wsi_20093192_mi.pdf Statutory Instrument 3192 (2009)]</ref> This resulted in the road being rerouted through pasture to the east of the original road, taking a right hand bend about {{convert|160|m}} south of The Old Mill, taking a 5.5% gradient, and rejoining the original road {{convert|210|m}} north of The Kell.  The original road has subsequently been converted to an access road for The Old Mill, Beavers Lodge and The Kell, accessing the new road at The Old Mill.\n\n'''Fishguard Bypass'''\nThe Fishguard Bypass was planned to provide a more direct route with greater capacity to the Port of Fishguard at Goodwick avoiding the town centre of Fishguard. It was constructed during the late 1990s and opened in 2000. It takes the form of a three-lane carriageway on an approx. 10% gradient around the western edge of Fishguard. It runs from its highest point at Rafael roundabout 1&nbsp;km south of Fishguard town in a generally northerly direction to its lowest point at Windy Hall roundabout where it rejoins the old A40 route at Gasworks Hill. The bypass is concurrent with a section of the A487 trunk road with the A40 dominant.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/331547 Fishguard Bypass Roundabout]</ref><ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2021037 Rafael Roundabout]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:High Holborn 1.jpg|[[High Holborn]]\nImage:New Oxford Street 1.jpg|[[New Oxford Street]]\nimage:marble.arch.london.arp.jpg|[[Marble Arch]]\nImage:Hoover Building 1.jpg|The [[Hoover Building]] on A40 is a [[Tesco]] supermarket\nFile:The A40 at Monmouth - geograph.org.uk - 606053.jpg|A40 at [[Monmouth]]\nFile:The last few metres of the A40, Fishguard - geograph.org.uk - 1512235.jpg|Western end of A40 at Goodwick\n</gallery>\n==See also==\n* [[British road numbering scheme]]\n* [[Trunk roads in Wales]]\n{{commons category|A40 road (Great Britain)}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Edward Platt, ''Leadville: A Biography of the A40'' (Picador, 2001). {{ISBN|0-330-39263-8}}.\n\n{{GB A road zone 4}}\n{{Motorways and Trunk Roads in England|state=collapsed}}\n{{Motorways and Trunk Roads in Wales|state=collapsed}}\n{{Transport in Buckinghamshire}}\n{{Transport in Carmarthenshire}}\n{{Transport in Gloucestershire}}\n{{Transport in Monmouthshire}}\n{{Transport in Pembrokeshire}}\n{{Transport in Powys}}\n\n{{coord|51.87824|N|2.03084|W|type:landmark_region:GB_dim:90000|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:4-0040}}\n[[Category:Constituent roads of European route E30]]\n[[Category:Roads in Buckinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Herefordshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in London]]\n[[Category:Roads in Monmouthshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Pembrokeshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Powys]]\n[[Category:Roads in the Brecon Beacons National Park|40]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Camden]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Ealing]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Hillingdon]]\n[[Category:Streets in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]\n[[Category:Streets in the City of Westminster]]\n", "name_user": "Seth Whales", "label": "safe", "comment": "Wikilinked", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A40_road"}

For these reasons, the strong electoral gains of the two green parties do not have the same implications for coalition-government formation as they do in Austria following the September 29, [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 parliamentary elections]] there, in which the Greens obtained their best results ever with 13.9% of the vote and 26 seats in a slightly smaller lower house of parliament.\n\n==Date==\nThe elections for the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] took place nationally on 20 October 2019.\n\nThe cantons individually organise their elections for the [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]], which all held on 20 October 2019;<ref>[https://www.ch.ch/en/elections2019/how-the-elections-are-organised/who-organises-the-council-of-states-elections/ Swiss Confederation] Council of States elections</ref> with one exception. In [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] the election took place on 28 April at the [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden#Landsgemeinde|2019 Landsgemeinde]].<ref>[https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/landsgemeinde-live_switzerland-s-open-air-voting-is-now-streamed-online-/44922306 SwissInfo]</ref> Depending on the results of the 20 October election, a second round or runoff election may be required in some cantons.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{See also|Voting in Switzerland}}\nThe 200 members of the National Council are elected from [[Cantons of Switzerland|26 cantons]], each of which constitutes a constituency. The cantons are of unequal population size and use different electoral systems. Six are single-member constituencies in which winners are determined by [[first-past-the-post voting]]; the remaining 20 cantons are multi-member constituencies, in which members are elected by [[open list]] [[proportional representation]]. Voters may cross out names on party lists, split their vote between parties (a system known as [[panachage]]), or draw up their own list on a blank ballot. Seats are allocated using the [[Hagenbach-Bischoff system]].<ref name=IPU1>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2305_B.htm Electoral system] IPU</ref>\n\nNational Council seats are apportioned to the cantons based on their respective population size (which includes children and resident foreigners who do not have the right to vote). Based on the official population count recorded at the end of 2016, [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] and [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] each lost a seat while [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Canton of Vaud|Vaud]] each gained a seat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsd.admin.ch/newsd/message/attachments/49478.pdf|title=St\u00e4ndige Wohnbev\u00f6lkerung nach Kantonen am 31.12.2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Swiss Confederation (Official website)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=10 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref> The least-populous cantons have just one seat in the National Council \u2014 in 2019 there are six such cantons, four of which are half-cantons.<ref>[https://www.ch.ch/en/elections2019/how-many-seats-does-each-canton-have-in-parliament Swiss Confederation] How many seats does each canton have in Parliament</ref>\n\nThe rules regarding who can stand as a candidate and vote in elections to the National Council are uniform across the Confederation. Only [[Swiss nationality law|Swiss citizens]] aged at least 18 can stand or vote and the citizens resident abroad can register to vote in the canton in which they last resided (or their [[Place of origin|canton of citizenship]], otherwise) and be able to vote no matter how long since, or whether they ever have, lived in Switzerland.\n\nThe 46 members of the Council of States are elected in 20 two-seat constituencies (representing the 20 'full' cantons) and six single-member constituencies (representing the six [[half-canton]]s). Two 'full' cantons with small populations \u2014 [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] \u2014 have therefore each two seats in the Council of States but only one seat each in the much larger National Council. In [[Canton of Jura|Jura]] and [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] the elections are held using proportional representation, whilst the other 24 use the majority system.<ref name=IPU2>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2306_B.htm Electoral system] IPU</ref>\n\nAs each canton regulates its election to the Council of States, the rules regarding who can stand as a candidate and vote in these elections varies canton-by-canton. Jura and Neuch\u00e2tel allow certain foreign residents to vote, whilst Glarus allows 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. Swiss citizens abroad registered to vote in a canton are permitted to vote in that canton's Council of States election only if the canton's law allows it. [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]] has [[compulsory voting]], though limited in implementation by way of only an insignificant fine.\n\n==Contesting parties ==\nThe table below lists contesting parties represented in the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]] before the election.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\"| Name\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Ideology\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Leader\n! colspan=\"3\"| 2015 result\n|-\n!

For these reasons, the strong electoral gains of the two green parties do not have the same implications for coalition-government formation as they do in Austria following the September 29, [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 parliamentary elections]] there, in which the Greens obtained their best results ever with 13.9% of the vote and 26 seats in a slightly smaller lower house of parliament.\n\n==Date==\nThe elections for the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] took place nationally on 20 October 2019.\n\nThe cantons individually organise their elections for the [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]], which all held on 20 October 2019;<ref>[https://www.ch.ch/en/elections2019/how-the-elections-are-organised/who-organises-the-council-of-states-elections/ Swiss Confederation] Council of States elections</ref> with one exception. In [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] the election took place on 28 April at the [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden#Landsgemeinde|2019 Landsgemeinde]].<ref>[https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/landsgemeinde-live_switzerland-s-open-air-voting-is-now-streamed-online-/44922306 SwissInfo]</ref> Depending on the results of the 20 October election, a second round or runoff election may be required in some cantons.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{See also|Voting in Switzerland}}\nThe 200 members of the National Council are elected from [[Cantons of Switzerland|26 cantons]], each of which constitutes a constituency. The cantons are of unequal population size and use different electoral systems. Six are single-member constituencies in which winners are determined by [[first-past-the-post voting]]; the remaining 20 cantons are multi-member constituencies, in which members are elected by [[open list]] [[proportional representation]]. Voters may cross out names on party lists, split their vote between parties (a system known as [[panachage]]), or draw up their own list on a blank ballot. Seats are allocated using the [[Hagenbach-Bischoff system]].<ref name=IPU1>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2305_B.htm Electoral system] IPU</ref>\n\nNational Council seats are apportioned to the cantons based on their respective population size (which includes children and resident foreigners who do not have the right to vote). Based on the official population count recorded at the end of 2016, [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] and [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] each lost a seat while [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Canton of Vaud|Vaud]] each gained a seat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsd.admin.ch/newsd/message/attachments/49478.pdf|title=St\u00e4ndige Wohnbev\u00f6lkerung nach Kantonen am 31.12.2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Swiss Confederation (Official website)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=10 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref> The least-populous cantons have just one seat in the National Council \u2014 in 2019 there are six such cantons, four of which are half-cantons.<ref>[https://www.ch.ch/en/elections2019/how-many-seats-does-each-canton-have-in-parliament Swiss Confederation] How many seats does each canton have in Parliament</ref>\n\nThe rules regarding who can stand as a candidate and vote in elections to the National Council are uniform across the Confederation. Only [[Swiss nationality law|Swiss citizens]] aged at least 18 can stand or vote and the citizens resident abroad can register to vote in the canton in which they last resided (or their [[Place of origin|canton of citizenship]], otherwise) and be able to vote no matter how long since, or whether they ever have, lived in Switzerland.\n\nThe 46 members of the Council of States are elected in 20 two-seat constituencies (representing the 20 'full' cantons) and six single-member constituencies (representing the six [[half-canton]]s). Two 'full' cantons with small populations \u2014 [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] \u2014 have therefore each two seats in the Council of States but only one seat each in the much larger National Council. In [[Canton of Jura|Jura]] and [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] the elections are held using proportional representation, whilst the other 24 use the majority system.<ref name=IPU2>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2306_B.htm Electoral system] IPU</ref>\n\nAs each canton regulates its election to the Council of States, the rules regarding who can stand as a candidate and vote in these elections varies canton-by-canton. Jura and Neuch\u00e2tel allow certain foreign residents to vote, whilst Glarus allows 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. Swiss citizens abroad registered to vote in a canton are permitted to vote in that canton's Council of States election only if the canton's law allows it. [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]] has [[compulsory voting]], though limited in implementation by way of only an insignificant fine.\n\n==Contesting parties ==\nThe table below lists contesting parties represented in the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]] before the election.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\"| Name\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Ideology\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Leader\n! colspan=\"3\"| 2015 result\n|-\n!

First reports in early 1942 had been made by the Polish officer [[Witold Pilecki]]. Tabeau's report was known as that of the \"Polish major\" in the [[Auschwitz Protocol]]s. After the war he became a noted cardiologist in [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref>http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/2191774,doc-dr-hab-jerzy-tabeau,id,t.html</ref>\n\nTabeau was a member of the Union of Armed Struggle, [[Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej]] (ZWZ) and had worked in the Polish underground under the pseudonym \"Jerzy Weso\u0142owski\" in Krak\u00f3w, distributing underground press. He was captured and taken to the Gestapo's [[Montelupich Prison]] in Krak\u00f3w. On 26 March 1942 he was transferred to Auschwitz, and - still under his false name - registered under the number 27273. He soon fell ill with [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]], and was placed in the camp hospital. After recovering he joined the hospital staff as a male nurse. In the summer of 1942 he came down with [[typhus]] and was selected by Nazi doctor Dr. [[Josef Klehr]] to be included in the list of patients to be killed in the gas chambers. However, thanks to the intervention by the Polish block elder, Alfred Stossel, he managed to escape death.<ref>Hermann Langbein ''People in Auschwitz'' Page 433 2004 \"The Pole Jerzy Tabeau owes his life to such a moment. In the summer of 1942 he was selected by Dr. Entress. Alfred Stossel, the Polish block elder, knew Tabeau and begged Klehr to take his name off the selection list. \"Klehr ordered that I be brought before him,\" reports Tabeau. \"He was sitting at a table in the small operating room, looked at me, and ordered me to get out.\"\"</ref>\n\nTabeau escaped with another Polish inmate, Roman Cieliczko, on 19 November 1943. The escape was pre-planned in July 1943 and originally intended to include five prisoners escape. As Cieliczko was in the camp under his given name, not a pseudonym, it was essential to first warn Cieliczko's mother in [[Zakopane]] to go into hiding. Escapees' relatives were often captured in reprisal.<ref>Aleksander Lasik, Wac\u0142aw D\u0142ugoborski, Franciszek Piper -Auschwitz 1940-1945: central issues in the history of the camp. ... - Volume 1 - Page 188  2000 \"The request that Anna Cieliczko be warned to flee was justified.

In December 1943 Tabeau proceeded to prepare a report about the camp. The work was completed in early 1944.\n\nIn March, on orders of the Underground, he left Krak\u00f3w on a mission to London to give testimony in person about the Polish resistance and confirm to the Allies the truth about the [[Nazi genocide]]. The journey took place without incident. After returning to Poland he went to the [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] area to form a \"Socialist Death Battalion.\" During one of the battles near [[Jordan\u00f3w]] in October 1944 Tabeau was wounded in the head, leaving him partially paralysed. However he lived to see the end of the war. After 1945 he settled in Krak\u00f3w, completing his medical studies and graduating from the [[Jagiellonian University]]. He became an assistant professor of Medicine, and a well-known cardiologist in Krak\u00f3w.\n\n==Tabeau's report==\nReports of the German genocide were emerging, including the 10 December 1942 address by the [[Polish Government in Exile]] to the [[League of Nations]], and evidence from escaped Jewish inmate from Majdanek, [[Dionys Lenard]].<ref>Les archives de la Shoah: - Page 189 Jacques Fredj, Centre de documentation juive contemporaine - 1998 \"D'apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages plus importants concernant la Shoah, le r\u00e9cit du Juif slovaque Dionys Lenard, publi\u00e9 en h\u00e9breu (et plus tard en polonais et en allemand), ainsi que le livre de [[Halina Birenbaum]], publi\u00e9 en polonais, en allemand et en ...\"</ref> However, as yet there was limited information about the conveyor-belt of death at Auschwitz.\n\nTabeau compiled his report between December 1943 and January 1944.

First reports in early 1942 had been made by the Polish officer [[Witold Pilecki]]. Tabeau's report was known as that of the \"Polish major\" in the [[Auschwitz Protocol]]s. After the war he became a noted cardiologist in [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref>http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/2191774,doc-dr-hab-jerzy-tabeau,id,t.html</ref>\n\nTabeau was a member of the Union of Armed Struggle, [[Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej]] (ZWZ) and had worked in the Polish underground under the pseudonym \"Jerzy Weso\u0142owski\" in Krak\u00f3w, distributing underground press. He was captured and taken to the Gestapo's [[Montelupich Prison]] in Krak\u00f3w. On 26 March 1942 he was transferred to Auschwitz, and - still under his false name - registered under the number 27273. He soon fell ill with [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]], and was placed in the camp hospital. After recovering he joined the hospital staff as a male nurse. In the summer of 1942 he came down with [[typhus]] and was selected by Nazi doctor Dr. [[Josef Klehr]] to be included in the list of patients to be killed in the gas chambers. However, thanks to the intervention by the Polish block elder, Alfred Stossel, he managed to escape death.<ref>Hermann Langbein ''People in Auschwitz'' Page 433 2004 \"The Pole Jerzy Tabeau owes his life to such a moment. In the summer of 1942 he was selected by Dr. Entress. Alfred Stossel, the Polish block elder, knew Tabeau and begged Klehr to take his name off the selection list. \"Klehr ordered that I be brought before him,\" reports Tabeau. \"He was sitting at a table in the small operating room, looked at me, and ordered me to get out.\"\"</ref>\n\nTabeau escaped with another Polish inmate, Roman Cieliczko, on 19 November 1943. The escape was pre-planned in July 1943 and originally intended to include five prisoners escape. As Cieliczko was in the camp under his given name, not a pseudonym, it was essential to first warn Cieliczko's mother in [[Zakopane]] to go into hiding. Escapees' relatives were often captured in reprisal.<ref>Aleksander Lasik, Wac\u0142aw D\u0142ugoborski, Franciszek Piper -Auschwitz 1940-1945: central issues in the history of the camp. ... - Volume 1 - Page 188  2000 \"The request that Anna Cieliczko be warned to flee was justified.

In December 1943 Tabeau proceeded to prepare a report about the camp. The work was completed in early 1944.\n\nIn March, on orders of the Underground, he left Krak\u00f3w on a mission to London to give testimony in person about the Polish resistance and confirm to the Allies the truth about the [[Nazi genocide]]. The journey took place without incident. After returning to Poland he went to the [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] area to form a \"Socialist Death Battalion.\" During one of the battles near [[Jordan\u00f3w]] in October 1944 Tabeau was wounded in the head, leaving him partially paralysed. However he lived to see the end of the war. After 1945 he settled in Krak\u00f3w, completing his medical studies and graduating from the [[Jagiellonian University]]. He became an assistant professor of Medicine, and a well-known cardiologist in Krak\u00f3w.\n\n==Tabeau's report==\nReports of the German genocide were emerging, including the 10 December 1942 address by the [[Polish Government in Exile]] to the [[League of Nations]], and evidence from escaped Jewish inmate from Majdanek, [[Dionys Lenard]].<ref>Les archives de la Shoah: - Page 189 Jacques Fredj, Centre de documentation juive contemporaine - 1998 \"D'apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages plus importants concernant la Shoah, le r\u00e9cit du Juif slovaque Dionys Lenard, publi\u00e9 en h\u00e9breu (et plus tard en polonais et en allemand), ainsi que le livre de [[Halina Birenbaum]], publi\u00e9 en polonais, en allemand et en ...\"</ref> However, as yet there was limited information about the conveyor-belt of death at Auschwitz.\n\nTabeau compiled his report between December 1943 and January 1944.

The \"Nafra Line\", a [[Subsidiary|subsidiary corporation]] owned and controlled by the Nafra Company, had an enviable record for promptness and efficiency in handling, loading, and discharging ocean-going vessels. The ''Tidewater'' and ''Plymouth'' were added to the company's initial three [[Watercraft|vessels]] and together built a large business. In October 1919, the  \"Nafra Line\" disposed of its vessels to a new organization, the '''\"Green State Steamship Corporation\"''', of which Mr. Joseph Mercadante was also president. This company, which had a capital of $10,000,000, added ten more ships to its fleet and expected to increase it to twenty-two.

The last of the steamers purchased by, the line here, the ''Circlnus'', sailed from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] Wednesday with a full cargo of lumber for [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]], Australia. This cargo amounted to 4.086,103 feet, it is reported by Brown & McCabe, stevedores, who had charge of loading the vessel.<br />\n The three other steamers purchased here by the Green Star line are the ''Corvus'', which went in ballast to [[Arica]], Chile, to load nitrates for [[Europe]]; the ''Centaurus'', which took a part cargo of lumber here and went to [[San Francisco]] to finish a general cargo for the west coast, and the ''Clauseus'', which went from here to San Francisco in ballast to load beans for [[Hamburg]].<br />\n '''Oriental Line Announced.'''<br />\n Considering the company's announcement from [[Baltimore]], little hope is felt that any of these four steamers will return for service on this coast, but the company has also announced the intention of operating a line to the orient and it is presumed that some of the steamers now being built by the G.M. Standifer Construction corporation will be utilized in this service.<br />\n The Green Star company has announced that it will inaugurate four distinct and regular services. One line will ply between [[Baltimore]] and the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Platte]] section of South America. Four of the company's large cargo carriers are to be assigned to this service. Another steamship freight service will be maintained between the Maryland port and Bordeaux. Having determined to invade the orient, the company has advised that it will operate to China, with [[Shanghai]] as the far eastern terminal. The fourth service will be established to [[Antwerp]] and [[Rotterdam]].<br />\n Philadelphia will have three lines.<br />\n The Green Star line has announced that it will inaugurate services to [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]], in Germany, and to [[Trieste]], on the Mediterranean. It did not state how frequent the sailings would be and did not indicate the number of ships which would be assigned to the respective lines.<br />\n At the present time, the company is continuing the operation of its New York-to-Genoa line which was started by the [[Nafra company]] during the war. Inasmuch as Joseph Mercariante, the president of the Green Star line. Is closely identified with the Italian interests, it is believed In shipping circles that there will be ample shipping facilities between the Mediterranean and the United States.<br />\n '''Louis F. Swift Director.'''<br />\n The news of the election of Louis F. Swift to the directorate of the company is regarded as significant, inasmuch as it may indicate that the Chicago packing company will ship its meat products in the vessels operated by the Green Star. While no official of the company has made this statement or has inferred that his election will mean the extension of this favor. It is believed that it will have a favorable effect.<br />\n The Green Star line has acquired more than 20 steamers, all of which are under American registry. Joseph Mercadante stated yesterday that \"on the completion of its extensive program the Green Star line will be the largest owner of ships of American registry in this country. \"He has not revealed what the \"extensive program\" is.<br />\n When the Green Star line has organized the director of its fleet, Robert McGregor, stated that the corporation would not confine its maritime operations to the maintenance of cargo ships. It is known that the company made a proposal a few months ago for the purchase of several of the ex-German passenger vessels.<ref name=\"OP\">[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1920-01-18/ed-1/seq-46/ocr.txt The Sunday \"OREGOXIAX, PORTLAND,\" JANUARY 18, 1920. >> GREEN STAR WILL PLYS ATLANTIC]</ref><ref name=\":0\">[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1920-01-18/ed-1/seq-46/ Historic Oregan Newspapers >> ''The Sunday Oregonian'' (Portland, Ore.) 1881\u2013current, January 18, 1920, SECTION TWO, Image 46]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Debt and Planet Steamship Corporation ===\n\n* October 5, 1921.

The company had a fleet of eighteen steamers, It was one of the pioneer purchasers of the shipping board vessels.<br /> The emergency fleet corporation is understood to be interested in the affairs of the Green Star line to the extent of $15,000,000. Nine of the company\u2019s steamers were bought from the shipping board. It is understood that on May 31 this company owed the shipping board $5,503,808.03 in amounts due or overdue\n\nIn February 1923, five ships of the Green Star Line were sold at auction at [[Baltimore]] for $735,000. This figure was considered too low by shipping experts (NYT, 28 February 1923). The Green Star Line was not officially reorganized until March 1923. A new corporation, the \"\u201cPlanet Steamship Corp.\", bought the remainder of ships owned by the Green Star Line. In September 1923, an official exchange of securities began, allowing holders of \"Green Star Line\" stock to trade for stock in the new company (''NYT'', 8 March and 4 September 1923).<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KunwMKT9dosC&pg=PA873 |title=The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers, Volume IV |author=[[Marcus Garvey]], [[Robert A.

The newspaper \"[[The Sunday Oregonian]]\", [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], wrote on page 46;\n<blockquote>\n <big>GREEN STAR WILL PLY ATLANTIC</big><br />\n '''Four Steamers Purchased Here to Sail From Baltimore.'''<br />\n ORIENTAL RUN PROMISED'''<br />'''\n '''Cruft Now Being Built at Standifer Plant Expected to Be Operated on Pacific.'''<br />\n Speculation as to the future field of operations of the Green Star Steamship company, which purchased four steel steamers in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and placed orders for the construction of five more, was ended last week by a formal announcement from the headquarters of the company in [[Baltimore]], where the Green Star line has purchased a large building to serve as a home for its shipping enterprises. The last of the steamers purchased by, the line here, the ''Circlnus'', sailed from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] Wednesday with a full cargo of lumber for [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]], Australia. This cargo amounted to 4.086,103 feet, it is reported by Brown & McCabe, stevedores, who had charge of loading the vessel.<br />\n The three other steamers purchased here by the Green Star line are the ''Corvus'', which went in ballast to [[Arica]], Chile, to load nitrates for [[Europe]]; the ''Centaurus'', which took a part cargo of lumber here and went to [[San Francisco]] to finish a general cargo for the west coast, and the ''Clauseus'', which went from here to San Francisco in ballast to load beans for [[Hamburg]].<br />\n '''Oriental Line Announced.'''<br />\n Considering the company's announcement from [[Baltimore]], little hope is felt that any of these four steamers will return for service on this coast, but the company has also announced the intention of operating a line to the orient and it is presumed that some of the steamers now being built by the G.M. Standifer Construction corporation will be utilized in this service.<br />\n The Green Star company has announced that it will inaugurate four distinct and regular services. One line will ply between [[Baltimore]] and the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Platte]] section of South America. Four of the company's large cargo carriers are to be assigned to this service. Another steamship freight service will be maintained between the Maryland port and Bordeaux. Having determined to invade the orient, the company has advised that it will operate to China, with [[Shanghai]] as the far eastern terminal. The fourth service will be established to [[Antwerp]] and [[Rotterdam]].<br />\n Philadelphia will have three lines.<br />\n The Green Star line has announced that it will inaugurate services to [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]], in Germany, and to [[Trieste]], on the Mediterranean. It did not state how frequent the sailings would be and did not indicate the number of ships which would be assigned to the respective lines.<br />\n At the present time, the company is continuing the operation of its New York-to-Genoa line which was started by the [[Nafra company]] during the war. Inasmuch as Joseph Mercariante, the president of the Green Star line. Is closely identified with the Italian interests, it is believed In shipping circles that there will be ample shipping facilities between the Mediterranean and the United States.<br />\n '''Louis F. Swift Director.'''<br />\n The news of the election of Louis F. Swift to the directorate of the company is regarded as significant, inasmuch as it may indicate that the Chicago packing company will ship its meat products in the vessels operated by the Green Star. While no official of the company has made this statement or has inferred that his election will mean the extension of this favor. It is believed that it will have a favorable effect.<br />\n The Green Star line has acquired more than 20 steamers, all of which are under American registry. Joseph Mercadante stated yesterday that \"on the completion of its extensive program the Green Star line will be the largest owner of ships of American registry in this country. \"He has not revealed what the \"extensive program\" is.<br />\n When the Green Star line has organized the director of its fleet, Robert McGregor, stated that the corporation would not confine its maritime operations to the maintenance of cargo ships. It is known that the company made a proposal a few months ago for the purchase of several of the ex-German passenger vessels.<ref name=\"OP\">[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1920-01-18/ed-1/seq-46/ocr.txt The Sunday \"OREGOXIAX, PORTLAND,\" JANUARY 18, 1920. >> GREEN STAR WILL PLYS ATLANTIC]</ref><ref name=\":0\">[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1920-01-18/ed-1/seq-46/ Historic Oregan Newspapers >> ''The Sunday Oregonian'' (Portland, Ore.) 1881\u2013current, January 18, 1920, SECTION TWO, Image 46]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Debt and Planet Steamship Corporation ===\n\n* October 5, 1921.

A new corporation, the \"\u201cPlanet Steamship Corp.\", bought the remainder of ships owned by the Green Star Line.
