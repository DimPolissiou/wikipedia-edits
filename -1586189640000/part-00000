It lies within the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]].\n\n==History==\n[[Lewis and Clark|Lewis and Clark Expedition]] stopped at \"Bear Medison\" island, near the location of today's city hall. Weston was the oldest settlement in the [[Platte Purchase]] of 1836 and was therefore also the farthest western settlement (thus, \"West Town\") in the United States until the admission of [[Texas]] as a state in 1845. Another suggested theory of origin is related to a story about a discharged US Army dragoon by the name of Joseph Moore. He bought the land and then had First Sergeant Tom Weston of D Company, First Dragoons, stationed at [[Fort Leavenworth]] across the [[Missouri River]], lay out a town plan. It is this individual after whom the town is named.\n\nWilliam \"[[Buffalo Bill]]\" Cody was at one time a resident of Weston, and the town was a major \"jumping off\" point for the [[Santa Fe Trail]], the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[California Gold Rush]].\n\nIn 1881, Weston was the site of the [[lynching]] of the biracial Charles Reese after he was accused of the rape and murder of the sixteen-year-old Nancy Stillwell.<ref>\"HEMPED TO HADES.

The brewery closed in 1919 when [[Volstead Act|Prohibition]] was signed into law.

In 2005, the Weston Brewing Company reopened and one of the cellars now houses a unique bar which requires patrons to descend down through a small rock faced tunnel to get to the large, cool, cavern like bar.<ref>http://westonmo.com/full_content.php?article_id=730&full=yes&pbr=1</ref>\n\nThe [[McCormick Distillery]], [[Missouri District Warehouse]], [[Pleasant Ridge United Baptist Church]], Sugar Creek Site, and [[Weston Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20100730.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places|date=2010-07-30|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 7/19/10 though 7/23/10|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nWeston is located at {{Coord|39|24|48|N|94|53|52|W|type:city}} (39.413370, -94.897780).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.35|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all land.<ref name =\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 1915\n|1860= 1810\n|1870= 1614\n|1880= 1329\n|1890= 1134\n|1900= 1019\n|1910= 1019\n|1920= 991\n|1930= 1028\n|1940= 1121\n|1950= 1067\n|1960= 1057\n|1970= 1267\n|1980= 1440\n|1990= 1528\n|2000= 1631\n|2010= 1641\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1808\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 11, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,641 people, 702 households, and 457 families living in the city.

The Normans conquered the area that is now Cumbria in 1092 during the reign of [[William II of England|William II]] and created the [[barony (county division)|baronies]] of Kendal and Westmorland. These were originally distinct jurisdictions with separate sheriffs, but were formed into a single county of Westmorland in 1226/7.<ref name=\"youngs\">F.A. Youngs, ''Guide to the Local Administrative units of England, Vol.II, Northern England'', London, 1991</ref> Before 1226 the Barony of Kendal was connected to the [[Earl of Lancaster|Earldom or Honour of Lancaster]] while that of Westmorland was part of the [[Earl of Carlisle|Earldom of Carlisle]].\n\nThe historic county boundaries are with [[Cumberland]] to the north, [[County Durham]] and [[Yorkshire]] to the east, and [[Lancashire]] to the south and west. [[Windermere]] forms part of the western border with [[Furness|Lancashire north of the sands]], and [[Ullswater]] part of the border with Cumberland.\n\nThe highest point of the county is [[Helvellyn]] at 3,117&nbsp;ft (950m). According to the 1831 census the county covered an area of {{convert|485990|acre|km2}}.<ref name=census_1831/>\n\n[[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]], the historic county town, formed a historic borough and was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], although reform came in 1885. [[Kendal]] was reformed as a municipal borough in 1835.\n\n===Division into wards===\nRather than being divided into [[hundred (county division)|hundred]]s, Westmorland was subdivided into the two [[Barony (country subdivision)|baronies]] of [[Barony of Westmorland|Westmorland]] (or sometimes Appleby) and [[Barony of Kendal|Kendal]].\n\nThe baronies were each further subdivided into two wards:\n\n*'''Westmorland'''\n**East ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10174971 Vision of Britain] - History of East ward</ref> - [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]], [[Brough, Cumbria|Brough]], [[Kirkby Stephen]], [[Orton, Eden|Orton]], [[Tebay]]\n**West ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10075762 Vision of Britain] - History of West ward</ref> - [[Askham, Cumbria|Askham]], [[Bampton, Cumbria|Bampton]], [[Barton, Cumbria|Barton]], [[Patterdale]], [[Shap]], [[Yanwath]]\n*'''Kendal'''\n**Kendal ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10030614 Vision of Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814080306/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10030614 |date=2011-08-14 }} - History of Kendal ward</ref> - [[Ambleside]],  [[Burton-in-Kendal]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[Grayrigg]], [[Kentmere]], [[Kendal]], [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]]\n**Lonsdale ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10204483 Vision of Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001002601/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10204483 |date=2007-10-01 }} - History of Lonsdale ward</ref> - [[Kirkby Lonsdale]]\n\n==Modern history==\nIn 1889, under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], a [[Westmorland County Council|county council]] was created for Westmorland, taking functions from the [[Quarter Sessions]]. Westmorland had no [[county borough]]s throughout its history, so the [[administrative county]], the area under the control of the county council, was coterminous with the geographic county. The county council was based at [[Kendal]], rather than the historic county town of [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]].\n\nAside from the two municipal boroughs of Kendal and Appleby, the [[Local Government Act 1894]] divided the county into [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] and [[rural districts]]:\n*'''5 Urban Districts:''' [[Ambleside]], [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness on Windermere]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[Kirkby Lonsdale]], [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]]\n*'''3 Rural Districts:''' West Ward, East Westmorland, South Westmorland\nIn 1905 a new [[Shap]] urban district was formed, while Windermere absorbed the neighbouring Bowness UD.\n\nA [[Local Government Act 1929|County Review Order]] in 1935 reduced the number of districts in the county: \n*A new Lakes Urban District was formed by the merger of Ambleside and Grasmere UDs and adjacent parishes in West Ward and South Westmorland RDs\n*East Westmorland RD, most of West Ward RD and Shap UD were merged to form North Westmorland Rural District\n*South Westmorland RD absorbed Kirkby Lonsdale UD, at the same time losing an area to Lakes UD.<ref name=\"youngs\"/>\n\nDespite their title, many of Westmorland's urban districts, such as Lakes, Grasmere, and Shap, were quite rural in character.\n\nAccording to the 1971 census, Westmorland was the second least populated administrative county in England, after [[Rutland]]. The distribution of population was as follows:<ref>1971 Census; Small Area Statistics</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!District||Population\n|-\n|[[Municipal Borough of Appleby]] || 1,944\n|-\n|[[Municipal Borough of Kendal]] || 21,602\n|-\n|[[Lakes Urban District]] || 5,815\n|-\n|[[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere Urban District]] || 8,065\n|-\n|[[North Westmorland Rural District]] || 14,778\n|-\n|[[South Westmorland Rural District]] || 20,633\n|}\n\nIn 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the county council was abolished and its former area was combined with [[Cumberland]] and parts of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] to form the new county of [[Cumbria]], administered by a new [[Cumbria County Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/1|title=Local Government Act 1972|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}</ref> The area now forms parts of the districts of [[South Lakeland]] and [[Eden, Cumbria|Eden]].\n\n==Coat of arms==\nWestmorland County Council was granted a [[coat of arms]] by the [[College of Arms]] in 1926. The design of the shield referred to the two components of the county: on two red bars (from the arms of the de Lancaster family, Barons of Kendal) was placed a gold apple tree (from the seal of the borough of Appleby, for the Barony of Westmorland). The crest above the shield was the head of a ram of the local [[Herdwick (sheep)|Herdwick]] breed. On the ram's forehead was a shearman's hook, a tool used in the handling of wool. The hook was part of the insignia of the borough of Kendal, the administrative centre of the county council.<ref>W.C.

It formed an [[administrative county]] between 1889 and 1974, after which the whole county was administered by the new administrative county of [[Cumbria]].  In 2013, the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]], [[Eric Pickles]], formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of England's 39 historic counties, including Westmorland.<ref name=\"CLG-EP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eric-pickles-celebrate-st-george-and-englands-traditional-counties|title=Eric Pickles: celebrate St George and England's traditional counties|publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Ind-EP\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/eric-pickless-championing-of-traditional-english-counties-is-something-we-can-all-get-behind-8568394.html|title=Eric Pickles's championing of traditional English counties is something we can all get behind|publisher=The Independent|first=Simon|last=Kelner|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013|location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"ABC-EP\">{{cite web|url=http://abcounties.com/news/government-formally-acknowledges-the-historic-counties-to-celebrate-st-georges-day/|title=Government 'formally acknowledges' the Historic Counties to Celebrate St George's Day|publisher=Association of British Counties|first=Michael|last=Garber|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early history==\nAt the time of [[Domesday Book]] in 1086, parts of the county were considered either to form part of [[Yorkshire]] or to be within the separate [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. The Normans conquered the area that is now Cumbria in 1092 during the reign of [[William II of England|William II]] and created the [[barony (county division)|baronies]] of Kendal and Westmorland. These were originally distinct jurisdictions with separate sheriffs, but were formed into a single county of Westmorland in 1226/7.<ref name=\"youngs\">F.A. Youngs, ''Guide to the Local Administrative units of England, Vol.II, Northern England'', London, 1991</ref> Before 1226 the Barony of Kendal was connected to the [[Earl of Lancaster|Earldom or Honour of Lancaster]] while that of Westmorland was part of the [[Earl of Carlisle|Earldom of Carlisle]].\n\nThe historic county boundaries are with [[Cumberland]] to the north, [[County Durham]] and [[Yorkshire]] to the east, and [[Lancashire]] to the south and west. [[Windermere]] forms part of the western border with [[Furness|Lancashire north of the sands]], and [[Ullswater]] part of the border with Cumberland.\n\nThe highest point of the county is [[Helvellyn]] at 3,117&nbsp;ft (950m). According to the 1831 census the county covered an area of {{convert|485990|acre|km2}}.<ref name=census_1831/>\n\n[[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]], the historic county town, formed a historic borough and was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], although reform came in 1885. [[Kendal]] was reformed as a municipal borough in 1835.\n\n===Division into wards===\nRather than being divided into [[hundred (county division)|hundred]]s, Westmorland was subdivided into the two [[Barony (country subdivision)|baronies]] of [[Barony of Westmorland|Westmorland]] (or sometimes Appleby) and [[Barony of Kendal|Kendal]].\n\nThe baronies were each further subdivided into two wards:\n\n*'''Westmorland'''\n**East ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10174971 Vision of Britain] - History of East ward</ref> - [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]], [[Brough, Cumbria|Brough]], [[Kirkby Stephen]], [[Orton, Eden|Orton]], [[Tebay]]\n**West ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10075762 Vision of Britain] - History of West ward</ref> - [[Askham, Cumbria|Askham]], [[Bampton, Cumbria|Bampton]], [[Barton, Cumbria|Barton]], [[Patterdale]], [[Shap]], [[Yanwath]]\n*'''Kendal'''\n**Kendal ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10030614 Vision of Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814080306/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10030614 |date=2011-08-14 }} - History of Kendal ward</ref> - [[Ambleside]],  [[Burton-in-Kendal]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[Grayrigg]], [[Kentmere]], [[Kendal]], [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]]\n**Lonsdale ward<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10204483 Vision of Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001002601/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10204483 |date=2007-10-01 }} - History of Lonsdale ward</ref> - [[Kirkby Lonsdale]]\n\n==Modern history==\nIn 1889, under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], a [[Westmorland County Council|county council]] was created for Westmorland, taking functions from the [[Quarter Sessions]]. Westmorland had no [[county borough]]s throughout its history, so the [[administrative county]], the area under the control of the county council, was coterminous with the geographic county. The county council was based at [[Kendal]], rather than the historic county town of [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]].\n\nAside from the two municipal boroughs of Kendal and Appleby, the [[Local Government Act 1894]] divided the county into [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] and [[rural districts]]:\n*'''5 Urban Districts:''' [[Ambleside]], [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness on Windermere]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[Kirkby Lonsdale]], [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]]\n*'''3 Rural Districts:''' West Ward, East Westmorland, South Westmorland\nIn 1905 a new [[Shap]] urban district was formed, while Windermere absorbed the neighbouring Bowness UD.\n\nA [[Local Government Act 1929|County Review Order]] in 1935 reduced the number of districts in the county: \n*A new Lakes Urban District was formed by the merger of Ambleside and Grasmere UDs and adjacent parishes in West Ward and South Westmorland RDs\n*East Westmorland RD, most of West Ward RD and Shap UD were merged to form North Westmorland Rural District\n*South Westmorland RD absorbed Kirkby Lonsdale UD, at the same time losing an area to Lakes UD.<ref name=\"youngs\"/>\n\nDespite their title, many of Westmorland's urban districts, such as Lakes, Grasmere, and Shap, were quite rural in character.\n\nAccording to the 1971 census, Westmorland was the second least populated administrative county in England, after [[Rutland]]. The distribution of population was as follows:<ref>1971 Census; Small Area Statistics</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!District||Population\n|-\n|[[Municipal Borough of Appleby]] || 1,944\n|-\n|[[Municipal Borough of Kendal]] || 21,602\n|-\n|[[Lakes Urban District]] || 5,815\n|-\n|[[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere Urban District]] || 8,065\n|-\n|[[North Westmorland Rural District]] || 14,778\n|-\n|[[South Westmorland Rural District]] || 20,633\n|}\n\nIn 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the county council was abolished and its former area was combined with [[Cumberland]] and parts of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] to form the new county of [[Cumbria]], administered by a new [[Cumbria County Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/1|title=Local Government Act 1972|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}</ref> The area now forms parts of the districts of [[South Lakeland]] and [[Eden, Cumbria|Eden]].\n\n==Coat of arms==\nWestmorland County Council was granted a [[coat of arms]] by the [[College of Arms]] in 1926. The design of the shield referred to the two components of the county: on two red bars (from the arms of the de Lancaster family, Barons of Kendal) was placed a gold apple tree (from the seal of the borough of Appleby, for the Barony of Westmorland). The crest above the shield was the head of a ram of the local [[Herdwick (sheep)|Herdwick]] breed. On the ram's forehead was a shearman's hook, a tool used in the handling of wool. The hook was part of the insignia of the borough of Kendal, the administrative centre of the county council.<ref>W.C.
