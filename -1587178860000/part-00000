Following the disbanding of bassist [[Jeff Ament]] and guitarist [[Stone Gossard]]'s previous group [[Mother Love Bone]], the two recruited vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]], guitarist [[Mike McCready]], and drummer [[Dave Krusen]] to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams, to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness, and abuse. \n\nThough a [[grunge]] record, ''Ten''{{'}}s musical style is influenced by [[classic rock]] and combines an \"expansive harmonic vocabulary\" with an anthemic sound.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> While it deals with dark subject matter, it has generally been seen as a landmark of the early [[Alternative rock#Popularization in the 1990s|1990s alternative rock]] sound, with Vedder's unusually deep and strong voice alternating between solidity and vibrato against the unrestrained, guitar-heavy, [[hard rock]] sound that drew influence from rock bands of the 1970s. \n\n''Ten'' was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album produced three hit singles: \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\", \"[[Even Flow]]\", and \"[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]\". \"Jeremy\" became one of Pearl Jam's best-known songs, and received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[35th Annual Grammy Awards|35th Grammy Awards]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The video for \"Jeremy\" was heavily rotated by [[MTV]], and received four awards at the [[1993 MTV Video Music Awards]], including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time, even though ''Ten'' had been both recorded and released before [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', ''Ten'' was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the [[mainstream]]<ref name=\"blackdays\">Pearlman, Nina. \"Black Days\".

Following Green River's dissolution in 1987, Ament and Gossard played together in [[Mother Love Bone]] during the late 1980s. Mother Love Bone's career was cut short when vocalist [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]] died of a drug overdose in 1990, shortly before the release of the group's debut album, ''[[Apple (album)|Apple]]''. Devastated, it took months before Gossard and Ament agreed to play together again. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.<ref name=\"crowe\">{{cite web|last=Crowe |first=Cameron |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414205329/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world |archivedate=April 14, 2010 |title=Five Against the World |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 28, 1993 |accessdate=June 23, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist [[Mike McCready]], whose band Shadow had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.<ref name=\"secondcoming\">{{cite web|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming|title=The Second Coming of Pearl Jam|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=June 22, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719210047/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming|archivedate=July 19, 2006}}</ref> The three then went into the studio for separate sessions with [[Soundgarden]] drummer [[Matt Cameron]] and former Shadow drummer Chris Friel to record some instrumental demos.<ref name=\"goldmine\">Greene, Jo-Ann. \"Intrigue and Incest: Pearl Jam and the Secret History of Seattle (Part 2)\".

August 20, 1993.</ref> Five of the songs recorded\u2014\"Dollar Short\", \"Agytian Crave\", \"Footsteps\", \"Richard's E\", and \"E Ballad\"\u2014were compiled onto a tape called ''Stone Gossard Demos '91'' that was circulated in the hopes of finding a singer and drummer for the trio.<ref name=\"blackdays\" />\n\n[[San Diego]] musician [[Eddie Vedder]] acquired a copy of the demo in September 1990, when it was given to him by former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]]. Vedder listened to the demo, went surfing, and wrote lyrics the next day for \"Dollar Short\", \"Agytian Crave\", and \"Footsteps\". \"Dollar Short\" and \"Agytian Crave\" were later retitled \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\" and \"[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]\", respectively. Gossard and Ament heard the demo with Vedder's vocals and lyrics, and were impressed enough to fly Vedder out to Seattle for an audition. Meanwhile, Vedder had written lyrics for \"E Ballad\", retitled \"[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]\". Vedder arrived on October 13, 1990 and rehearsed with the band (now joined by drummer [[Dave Krusen]]) for a week, writing eleven songs in the process. Vedder was soon hired as the band's singer, and the group signed to [[Epic Records]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"blackdays\" />\n\n==Recording==\nThe band, then named [[Mookie Blaylock]], entered [[London Bridge Studio]]s in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in March 1991 with producer [[Rick Parashar]] to record its debut album. After working with Parashar on ''[[Temple of the Dog (album)|Temple of the Dog]]'', Stone and Ament asked him to co-produce and engineer ''Ten''. Parashar also contributed piano, Fender Rhodes, percussion, co-wrote vocal harmonies and co-wrote the intro/outro of the album. A few tracks were previously recorded at London Bridge in January, but only \"Alive\" was carried over from that session. The album sessions were quick and lasted only a month, mainly due to the band having already written most of the material for the record. \"Porch\", \"Deep\", \"Why Go\", and \"Garden\" were first recorded during the album sessions; everything else had been previously recorded during demo sessions at some point. McCready said that \"''Ten'' was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\".

Krusen left the band once the sessions were completed, checking himself into rehab.<ref name=\"goldmine\"/> According to Krusen, he was suffering from personal problems at the time.<ref name=\"goldmine\"/> Krusen said, \"It was a great experience. I felt from the beginning of that band that it was something special,\" and added, \"They had to let me go. I couldn't stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave me many chances, but I couldn't get it together.\"<ref>Acrylic, Kim. [http://www.punkglobe.com/kingsroyaldavekrusen109.html \"Interview with Dave Krusen of The Kings Royal\"]. ''[[Punk Globe]]''. January 2009.</ref> In June, the band joined [[Tim Palmer]] in England for [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]. Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in [[Dorking]], a converted farm that according to Palmer was \"about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get.\"<ref name=\"blackdays\" /> Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready finish up the [[guitar solo]] on \"Alive\" and tweaking the intro to \"Black\". Palmer [[Overdubbing|overdub]]bed a [[pepper shaker]] and a [[fire extinguisher]] as percussion on \"Oceans\".<ref name=\"blackdays\" />\n\nIn subsequent years, band members have expressed dissatisfaction with the way the album's mixing turned out. In 2001, Ament said, \"I'd love to remix ''Ten''. Ed, for sure, would agree with me. It wouldn't be like changing performances; just pull some of the [[Reverberation|reverb]] off it.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In 2002, Gossard said, \"It was 'over-rocked', we were novices in the studio and spent too long recording, doing different takes, and killing the vibe and overdubbing tons of guitar. There's a lot of reverb on the record.\"<ref>\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> In 2006, Vedder said, \"I can listen to the early records [except] the first record...it's just the sound of the record.

Vedder has since revealed that the song tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather (his real father having died long ago), while his mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father.<ref name=\"crowe\"/> \"Alive\" and \"Once\" formed part of a song cycle in what Vedder later described as a \"mini-opera\" entitled ''Momma-Son''<ref>{{cite book|title=Pearl Jam Twenty|last=Pearl Jam|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84887-493-0|page=39}}</ref> (the third song, \"Footsteps\", appeared as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] on the \"Jeremy\" single). Vedder explained that the lyrics told the story of a young man whose father dies (\"Alive\"), causing him to go on a killing spree (\"Once\") which leads to his capture and execution (\"Footsteps\"). It was later revealed that Vedder's lyrics were inspired by his long-held hurt in discovering at age 17 that the man he thought was his father was not, and that his real father had already died.<ref name=\"blackdays\" />\n\nWhile ''Ten'' deals with dark subject matter, it has generally been seen as a high-water mark of the early 1990s [[alternative rock]] sound, with Vedder's unusually deep and strong (and later much-imitated) voice alternating between solidity and vibrato against the unrestrained, guitar-heavy, [[hard rock]] sound that drew influence from [[Led Zeppelin]] and other rock bands of the 1970s. ''Ten''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s musical style, influenced by [[classic rock]], combined an \"expansive harmonic vocabulary\" with an anthemic sound.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] stated that the songs on the album fused \"the riff-heavy [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] of the 1970s with the grit and anger of '80s [[post-punk]], without ever neglecting hooks and choruses.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine\">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

The first part begins the album, before \"[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]\" starts, and the second part closes the album, after \"Release\". It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer \"Release\" as a [[hidden track]], but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line making up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 ''Bass Player'' magazine interview as \"my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) [[Mick Karn]]\"),<ref name=\"godfather\">Coryat, Karl. \"Godfather of the 'G' Word\".

Following the disbanding of bassist [[Jeff Ament]] and guitarist [[Stone Gossard]]'s previous group [[Mother Love Bone]], the two recruited vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]], guitarist [[Mike McCready]], and drummer [[Dave Krusen]] to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams, to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness, and abuse. \n\nThough a [[grunge]] record, ''Ten''{{'}}s musical style is influenced by [[classic rock]] and combines an \"expansive harmonic vocabulary\" with an anthemic sound.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> While it deals with dark subject matter, it has generally been seen as a landmark of the early [[Alternative rock#Popularization in the 1990s|1990s alternative rock]] sound, with Vedder's unusually deep and strong voice alternating between solidity and vibrato against the unrestrained, guitar-heavy, [[hard rock]] sound that drew influence from rock bands of the 1970s. \n\n''Ten'' was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album produced three hit singles: \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\", \"[[Even Flow]]\", and \"[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]\". \"Jeremy\" became one of Pearl Jam's best-known songs, and received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[35th Annual Grammy Awards|35th Grammy Awards]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The video for \"Jeremy\" was heavily rotated by [[MTV]], and received four awards at the [[1993 MTV Video Music Awards]], including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time, even though ''Ten'' had been both recorded and released before [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', ''Ten'' was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the [[mainstream]]<ref name=\"blackdays\">Pearlman, Nina. \"Black Days\".

Following Green River's dissolution in 1987, Ament and Gossard played together in [[Mother Love Bone]] during the late 1980s. Mother Love Bone's career was cut short when vocalist [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]] died of a drug overdose in 1990, shortly before the release of the group's debut album, ''[[Apple (album)|Apple]]''. Devastated, it took months before Gossard and Ament agreed to play together again. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.<ref name=\"crowe\">{{cite web|last=Crowe |first=Cameron |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414205329/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world |archivedate=April 14, 2010 |title=Five Against the World |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 28, 1993 |accessdate=June 23, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist [[Mike McCready]], whose band Shadow had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.<ref name=\"secondcoming\">{{cite web|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming|title=The Second Coming of Pearl Jam|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=June 22, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719210047/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming|archivedate=July 19, 2006}}</ref> The three then went into the studio for separate sessions with [[Soundgarden]] drummer [[Matt Cameron]] and former Shadow drummer Chris Friel to record some instrumental demos.<ref name=\"goldmine\">Greene, Jo-Ann. \"Intrigue and Incest: Pearl Jam and the Secret History of Seattle (Part 2)\".

Vedder listened to the demo, went surfing, and wrote lyrics the next day for \"Dollar Short\", \"Agytian Crave\", and \"Footsteps\". \"Dollar Short\" and \"Agytian Crave\" were later retitled \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\" and \"[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]\", respectively. Gossard and Ament heard the demo with Vedder's vocals and lyrics, and were impressed enough to fly Vedder out to Seattle for an audition. Meanwhile, Vedder had written lyrics for \"E Ballad\", retitled \"[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]\". Vedder arrived on October 13, 1990 and rehearsed with the band (now joined by drummer [[Dave Krusen]]) for a week, writing eleven songs in the process. Vedder was soon hired as the band's singer, and the group signed to [[Epic Records]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"blackdays\" />\n\n==Recording==\nThe band, then named [[Mookie Blaylock]], entered [[London Bridge Studio]]s in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in March 1991 with producer [[Rick Parashar]] to record its debut album. After working with Parashar on ''[[Temple of the Dog (album)|Temple of the Dog]]'', Stone and Ament asked him to co-produce and engineer ''Ten''. Parashar also contributed piano, Fender Rhodes, percussion, co-wrote vocal harmonies and co-wrote the intro/outro of the album. A few tracks were previously recorded at London Bridge in January, but only \"Alive\" was carried over from that session. The album sessions were quick and lasted only a month, mainly due to the band having already written most of the material for the record. \"Porch\", \"Deep\", \"Why Go\", and \"Garden\" were first recorded during the album sessions; everything else had been previously recorded during demo sessions at some point.

Vedder has since revealed that the song tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather (his real father having died long ago), while his mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father.<ref name=\"crowe\"/> \"Alive\" and \"Once\" formed part of a song cycle in what Vedder later described as a \"mini-opera\" entitled ''Momma-Son''<ref>{{cite book|title=Pearl Jam Twenty|last=Pearl Jam|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84887-493-0|page=39}}</ref> (the third song, \"Footsteps\", appeared as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] on the \"Jeremy\" single). Vedder explained that the lyrics told the story of a young man whose father dies (\"Alive\"), causing him to go on a killing spree (\"Once\") which leads to his capture and execution (\"Footsteps\"). It was later revealed that Vedder's lyrics were inspired by his long-held hurt in discovering at age 17 that the man he thought was his father was not, and that his real father had already died.<ref name=\"blackdays\" />\n\nWhile ''Ten'' deals with dark subject matter, it has generally been seen as a high-water mark of the early 1990s [[alternative rock]] sound, with Vedder's unusually deep and strong (and later much-imitated) voice alternating between solidity and vibrato against the unrestrained, guitar-heavy, [[hard rock]] sound that drew influence from [[Led Zeppelin]] and other rock bands of the 1970s. ''Ten''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s musical style, influenced by [[classic rock]], combined an \"expansive harmonic vocabulary\" with an anthemic sound.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] stated that the songs on the album fused \"the riff-heavy [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] of the 1970s with the grit and anger of '80s [[post-punk]], without ever neglecting hooks and choruses.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine\">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

The first part begins the album, before \"[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]\" starts, and the second part closes the album, after \"Release\". It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer \"Release\" as a [[hidden track]], but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line making up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 ''Bass Player'' magazine interview as \"my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) [[Mick Karn]]\"),<ref name=\"godfather\">Coryat, Karl. \"Godfather of the 'G' Word\". ''Bass Player Magazine''. April 1994.</ref> along with some guitar and sounds that seem to come from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, \"As I recall, I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control room, and then I just started programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and it just kind of came about like that.\"<ref name=\"blackdays\" />\n\n===Outtakes===\nThe album's singles featured two B-sides from the ''Ten'' recording sessions which were not included on the album, \"Wash\" and \"[[Yellow Ledbetter]]\".

She had dual nationality from birth, and even renounced her American nationality during her marriage(s) to Burton, only to restore her American citizenship in 1977 when she married John Warner. See note in 'Early life' for more information.--> actress, businesswoman, and humanitarian. She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s, and was one of the most popular stars of [[classical Hollywood cinema]] in the 1950s. She continued her career successfully into the 1960s, and remained a well-known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named her the seventh-[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female screen legend]].\n\nBorn in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939. She made her acting debut in a minor role in the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[There's One Born Every Minute]]'' (1942) but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and became a popular teen star after appearing in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944). She transitioned to more mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951).\n\nDespite being one of MGM's most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s. She resented the studio's control and disliked many of the films to which she was assigned. She began receiving roles she enjoyed more in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by [[Tennessee Williams]]: ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959); Taylor won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress for the latter. Although she disliked her role as a [[call girl]] in ''[[BUtterfield 8]]''<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE - UPPER CASE \"BU\" IS CORRECT --> (1960), her last film for MGM, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.\n\nDuring the filming, Taylor and co-star [[Richard Burton]] began an extramarital affair, which caused a scandal. Despite public disapproval, she and Burton  continued their relationship and were married in 1964. Dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the media, they starred in 11 films together, including ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963), ''[[The Sandpiper]]'' (1965), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1967 film)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1967), and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1966). Taylor received the best reviews of her career for ''Woolf'', winning her second Academy Award and several other awards for her performance. She and Burton divorced in 1974, but reconciled soon after, and remarried in 1975. The second marriage ended in divorce in 1976.\n\nTaylor's acting career began to decline in the late 1960s, although she continued starring in films until the mid-1970s, after which she focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, United States Senator [[John Warner]] (R-Virginia). In the 1980s, she acted in her first substantial stage roles and in several television films and series. She also became the first celebrity to launch a perfume brand. Taylor was one of the first celebrities to take part in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] activism. She co-founded the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] in 1985, and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1991. From the early 1990s until her death, she dedicated her time to philanthropy, for which she received several accolades, including the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]].\n\nThroughout her career, Taylor's personal life was the subject of constant media attention. She was married eight times to seven men, endured several serious illnesses, and led a [[jet set]] lifestyle, including assembling one of the most expensive private collections of jewelry in the world. After many years of ill health, Taylor died from [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] in 2011, at the age of 79.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Elizabeth Taylor with parents at Stork Club 1947.jpg|thumb|Fifteen-year-old Taylor with her parents at the [[Stork Club]] in Manhattan, 1947]]\nTaylor was born on February 27, 1932, at Heathwood, her family's home on 8 Wildwood Road in [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], London.<ref name=Walker>{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Alexander |title=Elizabeth: The Life of Elizabeth Taylor |year=1990 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=0-8021-3769-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/elizabeth00walk }}</ref>{{rp|3\u201310}} She received [[multiple citizenship|dual British-American citizenship]] at birth, as her parents, art dealer [[Francis Lenn Taylor]] (1897\u20131968) and retired stage actress [[Sara Sothern]] (n\u00e9e Sara Viola Warmbrodt, 1895\u20131994), were United States citizens, both originally from [[Arkansas City, Kansas]].<ref name=Walker />{{rp|3\u201310}}{{efn|In October 1965, as her then-husband Richard Burton was British, she signed an oath of renunciation at the US Embassy in Paris, but with the phrase \"abjure all allegiance and fidelity to the United States\" struck out.

She had dual nationality from birth, and even renounced her American nationality during her marriage(s) to Burton, only to restore her American citizenship in 1977 when she married John Warner. See note in 'Early life' for more information.--> actress, businesswoman, and humanitarian. She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s, and was one of the most popular stars of [[classical Hollywood cinema]] in the 1950s. She continued her career successfully into the 1960s, and remained a well-known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named her the seventh-[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female screen legend]].\n\nBorn in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939. She made her acting debut in a minor role in the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[There's One Born Every Minute]]'' (1942) but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and became a popular teen star after appearing in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944). She transitioned to more mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951).\n\nDespite being one of MGM's most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s. She resented the studio's control and disliked many of the films to which she was assigned. She began receiving roles she enjoyed more in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by [[Tennessee Williams]]: ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959); Taylor won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress for the latter. Although she disliked her role as a [[call girl]] in ''[[BUtterfield 8]]''<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE - UPPER CASE \"BU\" IS CORRECT --> (1960), her last film for MGM, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.\n\nDuring the filming, Taylor and co-star [[Richard Burton]] began an extramarital affair, which caused a scandal. Despite public disapproval, she and Burton  continued their relationship and were married in 1964. Dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the media, they starred in 11 films together, including ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963), ''[[The Sandpiper]]'' (1965), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1967 film)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1967), and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1966). Taylor received the best reviews of her career for ''Woolf'', winning her second Academy Award and several other awards for her performance. She and Burton divorced in 1974, but reconciled soon after, and remarried in 1975. The second marriage ended in divorce in 1976.\n\nTaylor's acting career began to decline in the late 1960s, although she continued starring in films until the mid-1970s, after which she focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, United States Senator [[John Warner]] (R-Virginia). In the 1980s, she acted in her first substantial stage roles and in several television films and series. She also became the first celebrity to launch a perfume brand. Taylor was one of the first celebrities to take part in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] activism. She co-founded the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] in 1985, and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1991. From the early 1990s until her death, she dedicated her time to philanthropy, for which she received several accolades, including the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]].\n\nThroughout her career, Taylor's personal life was the subject of constant media attention. She was married eight times to seven men, endured several serious illnesses, and led a [[jet set]] lifestyle, including assembling one of the most expensive private collections of jewelry in the world. After many years of ill health, Taylor died from [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] in 2011, at the age of 79.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Elizabeth Taylor with parents at Stork Club 1947.jpg|thumb|Fifteen-year-old Taylor with her parents at the [[Stork Club]] in Manhattan, 1947]]\nTaylor was born on February 27, 1932, at Heathwood, her family's home on 8 Wildwood Road in [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], London.<ref name=Walker>{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Alexander |title=Elizabeth: The Life of Elizabeth Taylor |year=1990 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=0-8021-3769-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/elizabeth00walk }}</ref>{{rp|3\u201310}} She received [[multiple citizenship|dual British-American citizenship]] at birth, as her parents, art dealer [[Francis Lenn Taylor]] (1897\u20131968) and retired stage actress [[Sara Sothern]] (n\u00e9e Sara Viola Warmbrodt, 1895\u20131994), were United States citizens, both originally from [[Arkansas City, Kansas]].<ref name=Walker />{{rp|3\u201310}}{{efn|In October 1965, as her then-husband Richard Burton was British, she signed an oath of renunciation at the US Embassy in Paris, but with the phrase \"abjure all allegiance and fidelity to the United States\" struck out.

They are [[electroacoustics (acoustical engineering)|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]]s, which convert an [[electrical signal]] to a corresponding [[sound]]. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a [[loudspeaker]], which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.

Alten ''Audio Basics'' Cengage 2011 {{ISBN|0-495-91356-1}} page&nbsp;63</ref> Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place.  Another type, known as '''earbuds''' or '''earpieces'''<ref name=\":5\" /> consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are [[bone conduction]] headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open. In the context of [[telecommunication]], a [[Headset (audio)|headset]] is a combination of headphone and [[microphone]].\n\nHeadphones connect to a signal source such as an audio [[amplifier]], [[radio]], [[CD player]], [[portable media player]], [[mobile phone]], [[video game console]], or [[electronic musical instrument]], either directly using a cord, or using [[wireless]] technology such as [[Bluetooth]], [[DECT]] or [[FM radio]].  The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]], to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of [[Hi fi|high fidelity]] headphones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|title=Headphones : The Ultimate buying guide - Hi-fidelity headphones|website=StereoCompare|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307135117/http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|archivedate=2016-03-07}}</ref>\n\nHeadphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.  Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the [[high fidelity]] of expensive units designed for music listening by [[audiophile]]s.  Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) [[phone connector (audio)|phone jack]] for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using [[Bluetooth]] connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |title=It's True: Apple Will Drop Headphone Jack To Make The iPhone 7 Slimmer, Says Source |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829052849/http://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |archivedate=2016-08-29 |work = Fast Company|first = Mark|last = Sullivan|date = 7 January 2016}}</ref>   Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit.  Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as [[audio engineer]]s mixing sound for live concerts or [[sound recording]]s and [[DJ]]s, who use headphones to [[cue (audio)|cue]] up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and [[call center]] employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.\n\n=={{anchor|history}}History==\n[[Image:Brandes Superior Matched Tone c. 1919-21.jpg|thumb|right|Brandes radio headphones, circa 1920]]\nHeadphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical [[audio signal]]s before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by [[Nathaniel Baldwin]], who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the [[United States Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=181 |last=Howeth|first = Linwood S.|title = History of Communications-Electronics in the United States Navy |chapter = Chapter XI: The Early Radio Industry and the United States Navy|page = 149|date=1963|accessdate=|df=}}</ref><ref>[http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html Utah History To Go.

The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm.  The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves.  The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor [[sound quality]]. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] varied; headphones used in [[telegraph]] and telephone work had an impedance of 75&nbsp;[[ohm]]s. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedance of 1000 to 2000&nbsp;ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and [[triode]] receivers.  Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.\n\nIn early powered radios, the headphone was part of the [[vacuum tube]]'s [[Plate electrode|plate]] circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.\n\nIn 1958, [[John C. Koss]], an [[audiophile]] and [[jazz musician]] from [[Milwaukee]], produced the first stereo headphones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Founded 1958 - World's First SP/3 Stereophone|url=https://www.koss.com/history/|website=koss.com|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183148/https://www.koss.com/history/|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"hearthis\">{{cite news|title=Now hear this: the history of headphones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|last=Smith|first=Caspar|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182953/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Previously, headphones were used only by the US navy, telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries.<ref name=\"hearthis\"/>\n\nSmaller earbud type earpieces, which plugged into the user's ear canal, were first developed for [[hearing aids]]. They became widely used with [[transistor radio]]s, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the [[Regency TR-1]]. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere.  The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a [[crystal earpiece|piezoelectric crystal]] to produce sound.  The 3.5&nbsp;mm radio and [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]], which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195855/http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|archivedate=2016-02-05}}</ref><ref>Description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model: <br>{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960'S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref> Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the [[Walkman]] portable tape player in 1979.\n\n== Applications ==\nHeadphones may be used with stationary [[Compact disc player|CD]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[home cinema|home theater]], [[personal computer]]s, or portable devices (e.g., [[digital audio player]]/[[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]]). [[Cordless]] headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a [[radio]] or [[infrared]] signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a [[Silent disco]] or [[Silent Gig]].\n[[File:Headphones-Sennheiser-HD555.jpg|thumb|[[Sennheiser]] HD 555 headphones, used in [[Audio Production|audio production]] environments (2007)]]\nIn the [[professional audio]] sector, headphones are used in live situations by [[disc jockey]]s with a [[DJ mixer]], and [[sound engineer]]s for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, [[DJ]]s use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate [[acoustic feedback]] while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.\n\nWired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35&nbsp;mm (\u00bc\u2033) and 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]. The larger 6.35&nbsp;mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5&nbsp;mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35&nbsp;mm and 3.5&nbsp;mm devices.\n\n== Electrical characteristics ==\n[[Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers]] may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.\n\n=== Impedance ===\nHeadphones are available with high or low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically measured at 1&nbsp;kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32&nbsp;ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600&nbsp;ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered [[CMOS]]-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.\n\nThe impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate [[damping factor]], and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present.<ref>{{cite web |last=Siau |first=John |title=The \"0-Ohm\" Headphone Amplifier |url=http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210012625/http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 }}</ref> Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.\n\nHistorically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500&nbsp;ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance [[Valve amplifier#Operation|tube amplifiers]]. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external [[headphone amplifier]] may be beneficial.\n\n=== Sensitivity ===\nSensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in [[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] level per milli[[watt]] (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per [[volt]] (dB (SPL) / V).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |title=Understanding Headphone Power Requirements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015203/http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |work = HeadWize|publisher = Northwestern University|first = Dennis|last = Bohn}}</ref>  Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably.  As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using [[Ohm's law]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{V} = \\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{mW} - 10 \\cdot \\log_{10}{\\frac{\\mathrm{Impedance}}{1000}}</math>\n\nAlternatively, online calculators can be used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphone Sensitivity & Efficiency Calculator|url=http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085636/http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|archivedate=15 November 2014}}</ref>  Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage.  For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 [[root mean square]] (RMS) [[voltage]] produces a maximum volume of 100&nbsp;dB.\n\nPairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones.  The maximum [[sound pressure]] level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120&nbsp;dB.  In contrast, the American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends an average SPL of no more than 85&nbsp;dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the [[European Union]] standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85&nbsp;dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40\u20134000&nbsp;Hz noise) of no more than 100&nbsp;dB to avoid accidental hearing damage.<ref>{{cite web |title= BS EN 50332 tests for headphones and earphones with portable music players|accessdate=|work = ISVR Consulting|url =http://www.isvr.co.uk/labtests/en50332.htm|date = 2 August 2018}}</ref>  Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.\n\nThe sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125&nbsp;dB/mW and usually measured at 1&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications |url=http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2991/~/understanding-earphone-%2F-headphone-specifications |work=Shure Customer Help |publisher=Shure |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nHeadphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: ''circumaural (over-ear)'', ''supra-aural (on-ear)'', ''earbud'' and ''in-ear''.\n\n=== Circumaural ===\n[[Image:Headphones 1.jpg|thumb|Circumaural headphones have large pads that surround the outer ear.]]\n'''Circumaural headphones''' (sometimes called '''full size headphones''' or over-ear headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over {{convert|500|g|lb|0}}. Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.\n\n=== Supra-aural ===\n[[Image:GradoPrestige-HeadphoneArticle.jpg|thumb|A pair of supra-aural (on-ear) headphones]]\n'''Supra-aural headphones''' or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with [[personal stereo]]s during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.\n\n=== Open or closed back ===\nBoth circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:\n\n'''Open-back''' headphones have the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.\n\n'''Closed-back''' (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.\n\n'''Semi-open''' headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe the term \"semi-open\" is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.\n\n=== Ear-fitting headphones ===\n\n==== Earphones ====\n{{multiple image\n |direction=vertical\n | image1=Earphones BW 2011-12-10 15-49-08.JPG | alt1=2\n | width1 = 170\n | image2=EarPods derecho.JPG | alt3=4\n | width2 = 170\n | footer = Earbuds/earphones sit in the outer ear\n}}\nEarphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the [[outer ear]], facing but not inserted in the ear canal.

Since the early days of the [[transistor radio]], earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices. They are sold at times with foam pads for comfort. (The use of the term ''earbuds'', which has been around since at least 1984, did not hit its peak until after 2001, with the success of Apple's MP3 player.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |title=Who Made That Earbud? |work = The New York Times Magazine|date = 16 May 2014|first = Daniel|last = Engber|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030114/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |archivedate=2017-02-02 }}</ref>)\n\n==== In-ear headphones ====\n{{Main|In-ear monitor}}\n[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|upright|In-ear monitors extend into the ear canal, providing isolation from outside noise.]]\nIn-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the [[ear canal]] itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by [[audio engineer]]s and [[musician]]s as well as audiophiles.\n\nThe outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, [[aluminum]], ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphones as a Driving Distraction|url=https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|accessdate=14 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023105/https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nGeneric or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from [[silicone]] rubber, [[elastomer]], or foam.

Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.\n\n==== Telephone headsets ====\n[[File:Se bluetooth headset.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sony Ericsson]] Cordless bluetooth headset]]\nTelephone headsets connect to a [[fixed-line]] telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the [[handset]] of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard [[4P4C]] commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5&nbsp;mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless [[bluetooth]] headsets are available, and often used with [[mobile telephone]]s. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by [[call centre]] workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.\n\nFor older models of telephones, the headset microphone [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound [[amplifier|amplification]] for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or [[AC adaptor]]s.\n\n==== Communication headsets ====\n[[File:Communication Headset.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Communication headset used by aviators]]\nCommunication headsets are used for two-way communication and typically consist of a headphone and attached microphone. Such headsets are used in a variety of professions as aviation, military, sports, music, and many service-oriented sectors. They come in all shapes and sizes, depending on use, required noise attenuation, and fidelity of communication needed.\n\n== Ambient noise reduction ==\nUnwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active [[Noise-cancelling headphones|noise cancellation]].\n\n[[File:In-ears-earphones.png|thumb|left|In-ears are among those good for noise isolation]]\nPassive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12&nbsp;dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15&nbsp;dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25&nbsp;dB.\n\nActive noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20&nbsp;dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.\n\n== Transducer technology ==\nHeadphones use various types of [[transducer]] to convert electrical signals to sound.\n\n=== Moving-coil ===\n[[Image:Headphone-transducer.jpg|thumb|right|A typical moving-coil headphone transducer]]\nThe [[Loudspeaker|moving coil driver]], more commonly referred to as a \"dynamic\" driver is the most common type used in headphones.  It consists of a stationary [[magnet]] element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]].  A [[voice coil]], a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like.   When the varying current of an [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce [[sound wave]]s.\n\n=== Electrostatic ===\n[[Image:Es spk.gif|thumb|right|Electrostatic loudspeaker diagram]]\nElectrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000&nbsp;volts.\n\nDue to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20&nbsp;kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.{{citation needed|reason=Such broad claims need sources|date=May 2015}}\n\nElectrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100&nbsp;V to over 1&nbsp;kV, and are on the user's head. Since the invention of insulators, there's no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant [[electric current]], which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.\n\n=== Electret ===\nAn [[electret]] driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009-2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a \"Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film\", Frequency response chart readings can reach 50&nbsp;kHz  at 100db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver, headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program. US patents 8,559,660 B2. 7,732,547 B2.7,879,446 B2.7,498,699 B2.\n\n===Planar Magnetic===\n\nPlanar Magnetic (also known as Orthodynamic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to [[Loudspeaker#Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers|Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers]].\n\nA planar magnetic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets.\nA current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.\n\n=== Balanced armature ===\n[[Image:Bal Arm.JPG|thumb|left|Balanced armature transducer with armature balanced and exerting no force on diaphragm]]\n\nA balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced'. As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is [[electric current]] through the coil, it [[Electromagnet|magnetizes]] the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to make [[sound]].\n\n[[Image:JH16 Balanced Armatures.jpg|upright|thumb|A custom in-ear monitor which uses 8 balanced armatures in a triple crossover configuration (4 low/2 mid/2 high). Headphone designs often use multiple balanced armatures to provide a higher fidelity sound.]]\nThe design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other.{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=isn't more sound from less power the definition of high efficiency?}} Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during [[World War II]] for use in military [[sound powered telephone]]s. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.\n\nToday they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work|title=How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work|last=Hertsens|first=Tyll |date=2014-12-15|website=InnerFidelity|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914044126/http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work |archive-date=2015-09-14|url-status=live}}</ref> They generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20&nbsp;Hz and above 16&nbsp;kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.\n\nThe earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5IMSAQAAMAAJ&q=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&dq=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.|title=A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The early years (1875-1925)|last=Joel|first=Amos E.|last2=Laboratories|first2=Bell Telephone|last3=Schindler|first3=G.

Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Other transducer technologies ===\nTransducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the [[Oskar Heil|Heil]] [[Air Motion Transformer]] (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and [[Plasma speaker|Plasma-ionisation]]. The first [[Air Motion Transformer|Heil AMT]] headphone was marketed by [[ESS Laboratories]] and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only [[Precide]] of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.\n\n[[Magnetostriction]] headphones, sometimes sold under the label ''Bonephones'', work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via [[bone conduction]]. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are [[deaf]] for reasons that don't affect the nervous apparatus of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the early 1990s, a French company called Plasmasonics tried to market a plasma-ionisation headphone. There are no known functioning examples left.\n\n== Benefits and limitations ==\n[[File:Sony MDR-7506 Stowed 7617.jpg|thumb|Sony MDR-7506 headphones in stowed configuration]]\nHeadphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for [[privacy]] or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public [[library]]. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20&nbsp;Hz within 3&nbsp;dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15\" or 18\") [[speaker driver]] to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with [[in-ear monitor]] headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.\n\nMarketed claims such as 'frequency response 4&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20&nbsp;Hz is typically very small.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html|website =CNET|title = How to buy headphones|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010315/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |quote =Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance\u201415 or 20Hz\u2014but almost always sound lightweight and bright.}}</ref> \nHeadphones are also useful for [[video game]]s that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire).\n\nAlthough modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo recordings]] since the release of the [[Walkman]], there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard [[Panning (audio)|panned]] sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.\n\n[[Binaural recording]]s use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2&nbsp;kHz, often using a [[dummy head recording|dummy head]]. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.\n\nIt is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.\n\nHeadsets can have [[ergonomic]] benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow [[call centre|call center]] agents to maintain better [[human position|posture]] without needing to hand-hold a [[transceiver#Telephony|handset]] or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html United States Department of Labor.

They are [[electroacoustics (acoustical engineering)|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]]s, which convert an [[electrical signal]] to a corresponding [[sound]]. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a [[loudspeaker]], which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.

Another type, known as '''earbuds''' or '''earpieces'''<ref name=\":5\" /> consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are [[bone conduction]] headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open. In the context of [[telecommunication]], a [[Headset (audio)|headset]] is a combination of headphone and [[microphone]].\n\nHeadphones connect to a signal source such as an audio [[amplifier]], [[radio]], [[CD player]], [[portable media player]], [[mobile phone]], [[video game console]], or [[electronic musical instrument]], either directly using a cord, or using [[wireless]] technology such as [[Bluetooth]], [[DECT]] or [[FM radio]].  The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]], to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of [[Hi fi|high fidelity]] headphones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|title=Headphones : The Ultimate buying guide - Hi-fidelity headphones|website=StereoCompare|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307135117/http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|archivedate=2016-03-07}}</ref>\n\nHeadphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.  Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the [[high fidelity]] of expensive units designed for music listening by [[audiophile]]s.  Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) [[phone connector (audio)|phone jack]] for plugging the headphones into the audio source.

Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as [[audio engineer]]s mixing sound for live concerts or [[sound recording]]s and [[DJ]]s, who use headphones to [[cue (audio)|cue]] up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and [[call center]] employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.\n\n=={{anchor|history}}History==\n[[Image:Brandes Superior Matched Tone c. 1919-21.jpg|thumb|right|Brandes radio headphones, circa 1920]]\nHeadphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical [[audio signal]]s before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by [[Nathaniel Baldwin]], who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the [[United States Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=181 |last=Howeth|first = Linwood S.|title = History of Communications-Electronics in the United States Navy |chapter = Chapter XI: The Early Radio Industry and the United States Navy|page = 149|date=1963|accessdate=|df=}}</ref><ref>[http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html Utah History To Go.

The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm.  The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves.  The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor [[sound quality]]. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] varied; headphones used in [[telegraph]] and telephone work had an impedance of 75&nbsp;[[ohm]]s. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedance of 1000 to 2000&nbsp;ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and [[triode]] receivers.  Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.\n\nIn early powered radios, the headphone was part of the [[vacuum tube]]'s [[Plate electrode|plate]] circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.\n\nIn 1958, [[John C. Koss]], an [[audiophile]] and [[jazz musician]] from [[Milwaukee]], produced the first stereo headphones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Founded 1958 - World's First SP/3 Stereophone|url=https://www.koss.com/history/|website=koss.com|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183148/https://www.koss.com/history/|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"hearthis\">{{cite news|title=Now hear this: the history of headphones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|last=Smith|first=Caspar|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182953/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Previously, headphones were used only by the US navy, telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries.<ref name=\"hearthis\"/>\n\nSmaller earbud type earpieces, which plugged into the user's ear canal, were first developed for [[hearing aids]]. They became widely used with [[transistor radio]]s, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the [[Regency TR-1]]. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere.  The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a [[crystal earpiece|piezoelectric crystal]] to produce sound.  The 3.5&nbsp;mm radio and [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]], which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195855/http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|archivedate=2016-02-05}}</ref><ref>Description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model: <br>{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960'S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref> Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the [[Walkman]] portable tape player in 1979.\n\n== Applications ==\nHeadphones may be used with stationary [[Compact disc player|CD]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[home cinema|home theater]], [[personal computer]]s, or portable devices (e.g., [[digital audio player]]/[[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]]). [[Cordless]] headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a [[radio]] or [[infrared]] signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a [[Silent disco]] or [[Silent Gig]].\n[[File:Headphones-Sennheiser-HD555.jpg|thumb|[[Sennheiser]] HD 555 headphones, used in [[Audio Production|audio production]] environments (2007)]]\nIn the [[professional audio]] sector, headphones are used in live situations by [[disc jockey]]s with a [[DJ mixer]], and [[sound engineer]]s for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, [[DJ]]s use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate [[acoustic feedback]] while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.\n\nWired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35&nbsp;mm (\u00bc\u2033) and 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]. The larger 6.35&nbsp;mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5&nbsp;mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35&nbsp;mm and 3.5&nbsp;mm devices.\n\n== Electrical characteristics ==\n[[Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers]] may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.\n\n=== Impedance ===\nHeadphones are available with high or low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically measured at 1&nbsp;kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32&nbsp;ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600&nbsp;ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered [[CMOS]]-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.\n\nThe impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate [[damping factor]], and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present.<ref>{{cite web |last=Siau |first=John |title=The \"0-Ohm\" Headphone Amplifier |url=http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210012625/http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 }}</ref> Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.\n\nHistorically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500&nbsp;ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance [[Valve amplifier#Operation|tube amplifiers]]. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external [[headphone amplifier]] may be beneficial.\n\n=== Sensitivity ===\nSensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in [[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] level per milli[[watt]] (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per [[volt]] (dB (SPL) / V).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |title=Understanding Headphone Power Requirements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015203/http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |work = HeadWize|publisher = Northwestern University|first = Dennis|last = Bohn}}</ref>  Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably.  As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using [[Ohm's law]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{V} = \\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\\mathrm{mW} - 10 \\cdot \\log_{10}{\\frac{\\mathrm{Impedance}}{1000}}</math>\n\nAlternatively, online calculators can be used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphone Sensitivity & Efficiency Calculator|url=http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085636/http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|archivedate=15 November 2014}}</ref>  Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage.  For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 [[root mean square]] (RMS) [[voltage]] produces a maximum volume of 100&nbsp;dB.\n\nPairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones.  The maximum [[sound pressure]] level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120&nbsp;dB.  In contrast, the American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends an average SPL of no more than 85&nbsp;dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the [[European Union]] standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85&nbsp;dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40\u20134000&nbsp;Hz noise) of no more than 100&nbsp;dB to avoid accidental hearing damage.<ref>{{cite web |title= BS EN 50332 tests for headphones and earphones with portable music players|accessdate=|work = ISVR Consulting|url =http://www.isvr.co.uk/labtests/en50332.htm|date = 2 August 2018}}</ref>  Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110&nbsp;dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.\n\nThe sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125&nbsp;dB/mW and usually measured at 1&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications |url=http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2991/~/understanding-earphone-%2F-headphone-specifications |work=Shure Customer Help |publisher=Shure |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nHeadphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: ''circumaural (over-ear)'', ''supra-aural (on-ear)'', ''earbud'' and ''in-ear''.\n\n=== Circumaural ===\n[[Image:Headphones 1.jpg|thumb|Circumaural headphones have large pads that surround the outer ear.]]\n'''Circumaural headphones''' (sometimes called '''full size headphones''' or over-ear headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over {{convert|500|g|lb|0}}. Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.\n\n=== Supra-aural ===\n[[Image:GradoPrestige-HeadphoneArticle.jpg|thumb|A pair of supra-aural (on-ear) headphones]]\n'''Supra-aural headphones''' or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with [[personal stereo]]s during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.\n\n=== Open or closed back ===\nBoth circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:\n\n'''Open-back''' headphones have the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.\n\n'''Closed-back''' (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.\n\n'''Semi-open''' headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe the term \"semi-open\" is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.\n\n=== Ear-fitting headphones ===\n\n==== Earphones ====\n{{multiple image\n |direction=vertical\n | image1=Earphones BW 2011-12-10 15-49-08.JPG | alt1=2\n | width1 = 170\n | image2=EarPods derecho.JPG | alt3=4\n | width2 = 170\n | footer = Earbuds/earphones sit in the outer ear\n}}\nEarphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the [[outer ear]], facing but not inserted in the ear canal.

Since the early days of the [[transistor radio]], earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices. They are sold at times with foam pads for comfort. (The use of the term ''earbuds'', which has been around since at least 1984, did not hit its peak until after 2001, with the success of Apple's MP3 player.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |title=Who Made That Earbud? |work = The New York Times Magazine|date = 16 May 2014|first = Daniel|last = Engber|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030114/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |archivedate=2017-02-02 }}</ref>)\n\n==== In-ear headphones ====\n{{Main|In-ear monitor}}\n[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|upright|In-ear monitors extend into the ear canal, providing isolation from outside noise.]]\nIn-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the [[ear canal]] itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by [[audio engineer]]s and [[musician]]s as well as audiophiles.\n\nThe outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, [[aluminum]], ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headphones as a Driving Distraction|url=https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|accessdate=14 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023105/https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nGeneric or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from [[silicone]] rubber, [[elastomer]], or foam.

Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.\n\n==== Telephone headsets ====\n[[File:Se bluetooth headset.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sony Ericsson]] Cordless bluetooth headset]]\nTelephone headsets connect to a [[fixed-line]] telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the [[handset]] of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard [[4P4C]] commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5&nbsp;mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless [[bluetooth]] headsets are available, and often used with [[mobile telephone]]s. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by [[call centre]] workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.\n\nFor older models of telephones, the headset microphone [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound [[amplifier|amplification]] for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or [[AC adaptor]]s.\n\n==== Communication headsets ====\n[[File:Communication Headset.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Communication headset used by aviators]]\nCommunication headsets are used for two-way communication and typically consist of a headphone and attached microphone. Such headsets are used in a variety of professions as aviation, military, sports, music, and many service-oriented sectors. They come in all shapes and sizes, depending on use, required noise attenuation, and fidelity of communication needed.\n\n== Ambient noise reduction ==\nUnwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active [[Noise-cancelling headphones|noise cancellation]].\n\n[[File:In-ears-earphones.png|thumb|left|In-ears are among those good for noise isolation]]\nPassive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12&nbsp;dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15&nbsp;dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25&nbsp;dB.\n\nActive noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20&nbsp;dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.\n\n== Transducer technology ==\nHeadphones use various types of [[transducer]] to convert electrical signals to sound.\n\n=== Moving-coil ===\n[[Image:Headphone-transducer.jpg|thumb|right|A typical moving-coil headphone transducer]]\nThe [[Loudspeaker|moving coil driver]], more commonly referred to as a \"dynamic\" driver is the most common type used in headphones.  It consists of a stationary [[magnet]] element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]].  A [[voice coil]], a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like.   When the varying current of an [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce [[sound wave]]s.\n\n=== Electrostatic ===\n[[Image:Es spk.gif|thumb|right|Electrostatic loudspeaker diagram]]\nElectrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000&nbsp;volts.\n\nDue to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20&nbsp;kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.{{citation needed|reason=Such broad claims need sources|date=May 2015}}\n\nElectrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100&nbsp;V to over 1&nbsp;kV, and are on the user's head. Since the invention of insulators, there's no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant [[electric current]], which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.\n\n=== Electret ===\nAn [[electret]] driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009-2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a \"Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film\", Frequency response chart readings can reach 50&nbsp;kHz  at 100db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver, headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program. US patents 8,559,660 B2. 7,732,547 B2.7,879,446 B2.7,498,699 B2.\n\n===Planar Magnetic===\n\nPlanar Magnetic (also known as Orthodynamic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to [[Loudspeaker#Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers|Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers]].\n\nA planar magnetic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets.\nA current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.\n\n=== Balanced armature ===\n[[Image:Bal Arm.JPG|thumb|left|Balanced armature transducer with armature balanced and exerting no force on diaphragm]]\n\nA balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is [[electric current]] through the coil, it [[Electromagnet|magnetizes]] the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to make [[sound]].\n\n[[Image:JH16 Balanced Armatures.jpg|upright|thumb|A custom in-ear monitor which uses 8 balanced armatures in a triple crossover configuration (4 low/2 mid/2 high). Headphone designs often use multiple balanced armatures to provide a higher fidelity sound.]]\nThe design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=isn't more sound from less power the definition of high efficiency?}}. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during [[World War II]] for use in military [[sound powered telephone]]s. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.\n\nToday they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage.<ref>\nTyll Hertsens.\n[http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work \"How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914044126/http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work |date=2015-09-14 }}.\n2014.\n</ref>\nThey generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20&nbsp;Hz and above 16&nbsp;kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.\n\nThe earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5IMSAQAAMAAJ&q=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&dq=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.|title=A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The early years (1875-1925)|last=Joel|first=Amos E.|last2=Laboratories|first2=Bell Telephone|last3=Schindler|first3=G.

Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Other transducer technologies ===\nTransducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the [[Oskar Heil|Heil]] [[Air Motion Transformer]] (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and [[Plasma speaker|Plasma-ionisation]]. The first [[Air Motion Transformer|Heil AMT]] headphone was marketed by [[ESS Laboratories]] and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only [[Precide]] of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.\n\n[[Magnetostriction]] headphones, sometimes sold under the label ''Bonephones'', work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via [[bone conduction]]. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are [[deaf]] for reasons that don't affect the nervous apparatus of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the early 1990s, a French company called Plasmasonics tried to market a plasma-ionisation headphone. There are no known functioning examples left.\n\n== Benefits and limitations ==\n[[File:Sony MDR-7506 Stowed 7617.jpg|thumb|Sony MDR-7506 headphones in stowed configuration]]\nHeadphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for [[privacy]] or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public [[library]]. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20&nbsp;Hz within 3&nbsp;dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15\" or 18\") [[speaker driver]] to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with [[in-ear monitor]] headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.\n\nMarketed claims such as 'frequency response 4&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20&nbsp;Hz is typically very small.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html|website =CNET|title = How to buy headphones|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010315/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |quote =Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance\u201415 or 20Hz\u2014but almost always sound lightweight and bright.}}</ref> \nHeadphones are also useful for [[video game]]s that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire).\n\nAlthough modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo recordings]] since the release of the [[Walkman]], there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard [[Panning (audio)|panned]] sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.\n\n[[Binaural recording]]s use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2&nbsp;kHz, often using a [[dummy head recording|dummy head]]. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.\n\nIt is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.\n\nHeadsets can have [[ergonomic]] benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow [[call centre|call center]] agents to maintain better [[human position|posture]] without needing to hand-hold a [[transceiver#Telephony|handset]] or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html United States Department of Labor.

Nonetheless, some forms of porn are more normative than others, and indeed not all forms of heteroporn are normative, such as 'rimming', girl on boy strap-on anal sex, and hard-core BDSM. Pornography also includes an endless array of different kinds of fetish, 'fat' porn, amateur porn, disabled porn, porn produced by women, queer porn, BDSM and body modification.

from country to country. Most countries allow at least some form of pornography. In some countries, softcore pornography is considered tame enough to be sold in general stores or to be shown on TV. [[Hardcore pornography]], on the other hand, is usually regulated. The production and sale, and to a slightly lesser degree the possession, of [[child pornography]] is illegal in almost all countries, and some countries have restrictions on pornography depicting violence, for example [[rape pornography]] or [[animal pornography]].\n\n[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pornographic entertainment on display in a [[sex shop]] window, where there is usually a minimum age to go into pornographic stores]]\nMost countries attempt to restrict minors' access to hardcore materials, limiting availability to [[sex shop]]s, mail-order, and television channels that parents can restrict, among other means. There is usually an age minimum for entrance to pornographic stores, or the materials are displayed partly covered or not displayed at all. More generally, [[disseminating pornography to a minor]] is often illegal. Many of these efforts have been rendered practically irrelevant by widely available [[Internet pornography]]. A [[Child Online Protection Act|failed US law]] would have made these same restrictions apply to the internet.\n\nThe adult film industry regulations in California require that all actors and actresses practice safe sex using condoms. It is rare to see condom use in pornography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/adultfilmindustry.html|title=Safety in the Adult Film Industry|website=www.dir.ca.gov|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> Since porn does better when actors are unprotected, many companies chose to film in other states. Miami is a major area for ammeter porn. Twitter also plays a big part in an actors success. Since Twitter doesn't censor their content, they can post what they want and doesn't have to worry about it getting taken down, unlike Instagram and Facebook.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80038162|title=Hot Girls Wanted {{!}} Netflix Official Site|website=www.netflix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a person receiving unwanted [[direct marketing|commercial mail]] he or she deems pornographic (or otherwise offensive) may obtain a [[Prohibitory Order]], either against all mail from a particular sender, or against all sexually explicit mail, by applying to the [[United States Postal Service]]. There are recurring [[urban legend]]s of [[snuff film|snuff movies]], in which murders are filmed for pornographic purposes.

In those countries, any film or photo with a child subject in a sexual act is considered pornography and illegal.\n\nPornography can infringe into basic [[human rights]] of those involved, especially when [[sexual consent]] was not obtained. For example, [[revenge porn]] is a phenomenon where disgruntled sexual partners release images or video footage of intimate sexual activity, usually on the internet, without authorization from the other person.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salter|first=Michael|year=2013|title=Responding to revenge porn: Gender, justice and online legal impunity|url=https://www.academia.edu/4585975|journal=Presented at \"whose Justice?

from country to country. Most countries allow at least some form of pornography. In some countries, softcore pornography is considered tame enough to be sold in general stores or to be shown on TV. [[Hardcore pornography]], on the other hand, is usually regulated. The production and sale, and to a slightly lesser degree the possession, of [[child pornography]] is illegal in almost all countries, and some countries have restrictions on pornography depicting violence, for example [[rape pornography]] or [[animal pornography]].\n\n[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pornographic entertainment on display in a [[sex shop]] window, where there is usually a minimum age to go into pornographic stores]]\nMost countries attempt to restrict minors' access to hardcore materials, limiting availability to [[sex shop]]s, mail-order, and television channels that parents can restrict, among other means. There is usually an age minimum for entrance to pornographic stores, or the materials are displayed partly covered or not displayed at all. More generally, [[disseminating pornography to a minor]] is often illegal. Many of these efforts have been rendered practically irrelevant by widely available [[Internet pornography]]. A [[Child Online Protection Act|failed US law]] would have made these same restrictions apply to the internet.\n\nThe adult film industry regulations in California require that all actors and actresses practice safe sex using condoms. It is rare to see condom use in pornography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/adultfilmindustry.html|title=Safety in the Adult Film Industry|website=www.dir.ca.gov|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> Since porn does better when actors are unprotected, many companies chose to film in other states. Miami is a major area for ammeter porn. Twitter also plays a big part in an actors success. Since Twitter doesn't censor their content, they can post what they want and doesn't have to worry about it getting taken down, unlike Instagram and Facebook.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80038162|title=Hot Girls Wanted {{!}} Netflix Official Site|website=www.netflix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a person receiving unwanted [[direct marketing|commercial mail]] he or she deems pornographic (or otherwise offensive) may obtain a [[Prohibitory Order]], either against all mail from a particular sender, or against all sexually explicit mail, by applying to the [[United States Postal Service]]. There are recurring [[urban legend]]s of [[snuff film|snuff movies]], in which murders are filmed for pornographic purposes.

In those countries, any film or photo with a child subject in a sexual act is considered pornography and illegal.\n\nPornography can infringe into basic [[human rights]] of those involved, especially when [[sexual consent]] was not obtained. For example, [[revenge porn]] is a phenomenon where disgruntled sexual partners release images or video footage of intimate sexual activity, usually on the internet, without authorization from the other person.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salter|first=Michael|year=2013|title=Responding to revenge porn: Gender, justice and online legal impunity|url=https://www.academia.edu/4585975|journal=Presented at \"whose Justice?

When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience.

She possesses regenerative abilities which allow her to revive herself after her actions lead to bloody vengeance from Yurine. Although it seems that Jashin is an absolutely immoral girl who manipulates Medusa or mocks Pecola without any regrets, at heart she is capable of good deeds and appreciates her close friends. However, as Yurine notes, Jashin is embarrassed by this and tries to hide the good traits of her personality because of her [[tsundere]] nature.\n;{{Nihongo|Yurine Hanazono|\u82b1\u5712 \u3086\u308a\u306d|Hanazono Yurine}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nichika \u014cmori]]<ref name=\"Cast\"/>}}\n:A human who summoned Jashin to Earth.

She and Jashin are pretty close, to such a level that their relationship leaves Yurine a feel of a \"boy-girl relationship\", with Jashin often behaving like an immoral husband who constantly manipulates her \"wife\" Medusa for the sake of monetary gain. At the same time, the tender side of Medusa allows her to discover the hidden good side of Jashin, which allows them to remain closest persons and regularly emphasize their strong bonds and interdependence.

She possesses regenerative abilities which allow her to revive herself after her actions lead to bloody vengeance from Yurine. Although it seems that Jashin is an absolutely immoral girl who manipulates Medusa or mocks Pecola without any regrets, at heart she is capable of good deeds and appreciates her close friends. However, as Yurine notes, Jashin is embarrassed by this and tries to hide the good traits of her personality because of her [[tsundere]] nature.\n;{{Nihongo|Yurine Hanazono|\u82b1\u5712 \u3086\u308a\u306d|Hanazono Yurine}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nichika \u014cmori]]<ref name=\"Cast\"/>}}\n:A human who summoned Jashin to Earth.

She and Jashin are pretty close, to such a level that their relationship leaves Yurine a feel of a \"boy-girl relationship\", with Jashin often behaving like an immoral husband who constantly manipulates her \"wife\" Medusa for the sake of monetary gain. At the same time, the tender side of Medusa allows her to discover the hidden good side of Jashin, which allows them to remain closest persons and regularly emphasize their strong bonds and interdependence.

It was issued in Europe as a single on 23 October 1971, coupled with \"[[My Wife]]\".\n\n[[Roger Daltrey]] sings most of the song, with [[Pete Townshend]] singing the [[middle eight]]: \"Don't cry/don't raise your eye/it's only teenage wasteland\". The song's title is a combination of the names of two of Townshend's philosophical and musical influences: [[Meher Baba]] and [[Terry Riley]].\n\n\"Baba O'Riley\" appears in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the All-Time 100 Songs, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\", and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as one of the [[500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]].\n\nIt also features on live albums: ''Who's Last'', ''Live from Royal Albert Hall'', ''Live from Toronto'', and ''Greatest Hits Live''. In concert Daltrey plays the violin solo on harmonica.\n\n==Background and composition==\nTownshend originally wrote \"Baba O'Riley\" for his [[Lifehouse (rock opera) | ''Lifehouse'']] [[project]], a [[rock opera]] intended as the follow-up to the Who's 1969 opera, [[Tommy (rock opera)| ''Tommy'']]. In ''Lifehouse'' a Scottish farmer named Ray would have sung the song at the beginning as he gathered his wife Sally and his two children to begin their exodus to London. When ''Lifehouse'' was scrapped, eight of the songs were salvaged and recorded for the Who's 1971 album ''[[Who's Next]]'', with \"Baba O'Riley\" as the lead-off track.\n\nTownshend stated in an interview that the song is about \"the absolute desolation of teenagers at [[Woodstock]], where audience members were strung out on acid and 20 people had brain damage. The irony was that some listeners took the song to be a teenage celebration: 'Teenage Wasteland, yes! We're all wasted!'\"<ref>''Guitar World'' Vol. 30 No. 9 pg. 76</ref>\n\nThe song's title combines the names of [[Meher Baba]] (1894-1969) and [[Terry Riley]] (1935- ), two of Townshend's philosophical and musical mentors.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title= The Who: The Ultimate Collection|titlelink= The Ultimate_Collection (The_Who_album)|others= The Who|year= 2002|pages= 12|publisher= MCA Records}}</ref> The song is often incorrectly called \"Teenage Wasteland\", after the phrase repeated in the song. \"Teenage Wasteland\" was in fact a [[working title]] for the song in its early incarnations as part of the ''Lifehouse'' project, but eventually became the title for a different but related song by Townshend, which is slower and features different lyrics.<ref>''Lifehouse Chronicles'' box set</ref> A [[Demo (music) | demo]] of \"Teenage Wasteland\" features in ''[[Lifehouse Chronicles]]'', a six-disc set of music related to the ''Lifehouse'' project, and in several Townshend compilations and videos.\n\nThe song uses a I-V-IV chord progression in the key of [[F major]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://www.theguitarlesson.com/guitar-lessons/baba-o-riley-guitar-lesson-the-who/\n |title= Baba O'Riley Guitar Lesson \u2013 The Who\n |publisher= TheGuitarLesson.com |accessdate= 26 November 2014\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Recording and release==\n\"Baba O'Riley\"'s backing track was derived from the ''Lifehouse'' concept, where Townshend wanted to input the vital signs and personality of [[Meher Baba]] into a synthesiser, which would then generate music based on that data. When this idea fell through, Townshend instead recorded a [[Lowrey organ|Lowrey]] Berkshire Deluxe TBO-1 organ using its marimba repeat feature as the backing track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/equip-baba.htm|title=Pete's Equipment, Lowrey Berkshire Deluxe TBO-1}}</ref>  This [[musical mode|modal]] approach was inspired by the work of [[Minimalism|minimalist]] composer [[Terry Riley]].\n\nThe song was derived from a nine-minute demo, which the band reconstructed.<ref>''Who's Next'' 1995 Remastered Liner Notes Page 17</ref>  \"Baba O'Riley\" was initially 30 minutes in length, but was edited down to the \"high points\" of the track for ''Who's Next''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/articles/townshen/crawdaddy_71.htm |title=The Hypertext Who \" Article Archive&nbsp;\u2014 The Who Puts the Bomp (1971) |publisher=Thewho.net |accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref> The other parts of the song appeared on the third disc of Townshend's ''[[Lifehouse Chronicles]]'' as \"Baba M1 (O'Riley 1st Movement 1971)\" and \"Baba M2 (2nd Movement Part 1 1971)\".\n\n\"Baba O'Riley\" was released in November 1971, as a single in several European countries. However, in the United Kingdom and the United States, it was released only as part of the album ''Who's Next''.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:The Who 2014.JPG|thumb|[[The Who]] performing \"Baba O'Riley\" live at Manchester Arena in 2014]]\n<!-- See [[WP:POPCULTURE]] before adding trivia -->\n\"Baba O'Riley\" appears at No. 340 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs/ | title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time | date = 2006-12-09| accessdate = 2009-08-14| work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815105453/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs|archivedate=2006-08-15}}</ref> The song is in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as one of the [[500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs-by-name-ac/ |title=500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll |accessdate=2008-07-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080707054811/http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs-by-name-ac/ |archivedate = 2008-07-07}}</ref> The band [[Pearl Jam]] regularly plays a cover of the song during concerts, and a readers' poll in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded this cover as #8 in their ''Greatest Live Cover Songs''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-greatest-live-cover-songs-20130212/8-pearl-jam-baba-oriley-0593864 |title=Readers' Poll: The Greatest Live Cover Songs |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref>\n\nDuring live performances, Roger Daltrey plays the studio violin part on harmonica.\n\n\"Baba O'Riley\" was used as the theme song for the popular television series ''[[CSI: NY]]'' (2004\u201313); with each ''CSI'' series using a Who song as its theme.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/02/the_who_performs_csi_medley.html |title=The Who Performs CSI Medley |last=Duboff |first=Josh |date=2010-02-07 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref> The song was also used in the Fourth Season of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' the song plays in the thirteenth episode \"Pictures of You\".

It was issued in Europe as a single on 23 October 1971, coupled with \"[[My Wife]]\".\n\n[[Roger Daltrey]] sings most of the song, with [[Pete Townshend]] singing the [[middle eight]]: \"Don't cry/don't raise your eye/it's only teenage wasteland\". The song's title is a combination of the names of two of Townshend's philosophical and musical influences: [[Meher Baba]] and [[Terry Riley]].\n\n\"Baba O'Riley\" appears in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the All-Time 100 Songs, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\", and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as one of the [[500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]].\n\nIt also features on live albums: ''Who's Last'', ''Live from Royal Albert Hall'', ''Live from Toronto'', and ''Greatest Hits Live''. In concert Daltrey plays the violin solo on harmonica.\n\n==Background and composition==\nTownshend originally wrote \"Baba O'Riley\" for his [[Lifehouse (rock opera) | ''Lifehouse'']] [[project]], a [[rock opera]] intended as the follow-up to the Who's 1969 opera, [[Tommy (rock opera)| ''Tommy'']]. In ''Lifehouse'' a Scottish farmer named Ray would have sung the song at the beginning as he gathered his wife Sally and his two children to begin their exodus to London. When ''Lifehouse'' was scrapped, eight of the songs were salvaged and recorded for the Who's 1971 album ''[[Who's Next]]'', with \"Baba O'Riley\" as the lead-off track.\n\nTownshend stated in an interview that the song is about \"the absolute desolation of teenagers at [[Woodstock]], where audience members were strung out on acid and 20 people had brain damage. The irony was that some listeners took the song to be a teenage celebration: 'Teenage Wasteland, yes! We're all wasted!'\"<ref>''Guitar World'' Vol. 30 No. 9 pg. 76</ref>\n\nThe song's title combines the names of [[Meher Baba]] (1894-1969) and [[Terry Riley]] (1935- ), two of Townshend's philosophical and musical mentors.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title= The Who: The Ultimate Collection|titlelink= The Ultimate_Collection (The_Who_album)|others= The Who|year= 2002|pages= 12|publisher= MCA Records}}</ref> The song is often incorrectly called \"Teenage Wasteland\", after the phrase repeated in the song. \"Teenage Wasteland\" was in fact a [[working title]] for the song in its early incarnations as part of the ''Lifehouse'' project, but eventually became the title for a different but related song by Townshend, which is slower and features different lyrics.<ref>''Lifehouse Chronicles'' box set</ref> A [[Demo (music) | demo]] of \"Teenage Wasteland\" features in ''[[Lifehouse Chronicles]]'', a six-disc set of music related to the ''Lifehouse'' project, and in several Townshend compilations and videos.\n\nThe song uses a I-V-IV chord progression in the key of [[F major]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://www.theguitarlesson.com/guitar-lessons/baba-o-riley-guitar-lesson-the-who/\n |title= Baba O'Riley Guitar Lesson \u2013 The Who\n |publisher= TheGuitarLesson.com |accessdate= 26 November 2014\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Recording and release==\n\"Baba O'Riley\"'s backing track was derived from the ''Lifehouse'' concept, where Townshend wanted to input the vital signs and personality of [[Meher Baba]] into a synthesiser, which would then generate music based on that data. When this idea fell through, Townshend instead recorded a [[Lowrey organ|Lowrey]] Berkshire Deluxe TBO-1 organ using its marimba repeat feature as the backing track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/equip-baba.htm|title=Pete's Equipment, Lowrey Berkshire Deluxe TBO-1}}</ref>  This [[musical mode|modal]] approach was inspired by the work of [[Minimalism|minimalist]] composer [[Terry Riley]].\n\nThe song was derived from a nine-minute demo, which the band reconstructed.<ref>''Who's Next'' 1995 Remastered Liner Notes Page 17</ref>  \"Baba O'Riley\" was initially 30 minutes in length, but was edited down to the \"high points\" of the track for ''Who's Next''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/articles/townshen/crawdaddy_71.htm |title=The Hypertext Who \" Article Archive&nbsp;\u2014 The Who Puts the Bomp (1971) |publisher=Thewho.net |accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref> The other parts of the song appeared on the third disc of Townshend's ''[[Lifehouse Chronicles]]'' as \"Baba M1 (O'Riley 1st Movement 1971)\" and \"Baba M2 (2nd Movement Part 1 1971)\".\n\n\"Baba O'Riley\" was released in November 1971, as a single in several European countries. However, in the United Kingdom and the United States, it was released only as part of the album ''Who's Next''.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:The Who 2014.JPG|thumb|[[The Who]] performing \"Baba O'Riley\" live at Manchester Arena in 2014]]\n<!-- See [[WP:POPCULTURE]] before adding trivia -->\n\"Baba O'Riley\" appears at No. 340 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs/ | title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time | date = 2006-12-09| accessdate = 2009-08-14| work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815105453/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs|archivedate=2006-08-15}}</ref> The song is in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as one of the [[500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs-by-name-ac/ |title=500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll |accessdate=2008-07-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080707054811/http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs-by-name-ac/ |archivedate = 2008-07-07}}</ref> The band [[Pearl Jam]] regularly plays a cover of the song during concerts, and a readers' poll in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded this cover as #8 in their ''Greatest Live Cover Songs''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-greatest-live-cover-songs-20130212/8-pearl-jam-baba-oriley-0593864 |title=Readers' Poll: The Greatest Live Cover Songs |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref>\n\nDuring live performances, Roger Daltrey plays the studio violin part on harmonica.\n\n\"Baba O'Riley\" was used as the theme song for the popular television series ''[[CSI: NY]]'' (2004\u201313); with each ''CSI'' series using a Who song as its theme.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/02/the_who_performs_csi_medley.html |title=The Who Performs CSI Medley |last=Duboff |first=Josh |date=2010-02-07 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref> The song was also used in the Fourth Season of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' the song plays in the thirteenth episode \"Pictures of You\".

It developed from the aborted ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' project, a multi-media [[rock opera]] written by the group's [[Pete Townshend]] as a follow-up to the band's 1969 album ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]''. The project was cancelled owing to its complexity and to conflicts with [[Kit Lambert]], the band's manager, but the group salvaged some of the songs, without the connecting story elements, to release as their next album. Eight of the nine songs on ''Who's Next'' were from ''Lifehouse'', the lone exception being the [[John Entwistle]]-penned \"My Wife\". Ultimately, the remaining ''Lifehouse'' tracks would all be released on other albums throughout the next decade.\n\nThe Who recorded ''Who's Next'' with assistance from recording engineer [[Glyn Johns]]. After producing the song \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" in the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]], they relocated to [[Olympic Studios]] to record and mix most of the album's remaining songs. They made prominent use of [[synthesizer]] on the album, particularly on \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\", which were both released as [[single (music)|singles]]. The cover photo was shot by [[Ethan Russell]]; it made reference to the [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]] in the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', as it featured group members standing by a concrete piling protruding from a [[slag heap]], apparently having urinated against it.\n\n''Who's Next'' was an immediate success when it was released in August 1971.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Who's Next |others=The Who |year=1995|origyear= 1971 |chapter=''Who's Next'' and ''The Lifehouse Project'' |first=John |last=Atkins |pages=13, 24 |type=CD liner |publisher=MCA Records |id=MCAD-11269}}</ref> It has since been viewed by many critics as the Who's best record and one of the greatest albums of all time. It was reissued on [[compact disc|CD]] several times, with additional songs originally intended for ''Lifehouse''.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Lifehouse (rock opera)}}\nBy 1970, the Who had obtained significant critical and commercial success, but they had started to become detached from their original audience. The [[mod (subculture)|mod movement]] had vanished, and the original followers from [[Shepherd's Bush]] had grown up and acquired jobs and families. The group had started to drift apart from manager [[Kit Lambert]], owing to his preoccupation with their label, [[Track Records]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=361}} They had been touring since the release of ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' the previous May, with a set that contained most of that album, but realized that millions had now seen their live performances, and [[Pete Townshend]] in particular recognized that they needed to do something new.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=363}} A single, \"[[The Seeker (The Who song)|The Seeker]]\", and a live album, ''[[Live at Leeds]]'', were released in 1970,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=358}} and an EP of new material (\"Water\", \"Naked Eye\", \"I Don't Even Know Myself\", \"Postcard\" and \"Now I'm a Farmer\") was recorded, but not released as the band felt it would not be a satisfactory follow-up to ''Tommy''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=365}}\n\nInstead, the group tackled a project called ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]''. This evolved from a series of columns Townshend wrote for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in August 1970, in which he discussed the importance of rock music, and in particular what the audience could do.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=368}} Of all the group, he was the most keen to use music as a communication device, and wanted to branch out into other media, including film, to get away from the traditional album/tour cycle.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=272}} Townshend has variously described ''Lifehouse'' as a futuristic [[rock opera]], a live-recorded [[concept album]] and as the music for a scripted film project.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=369}} The basic plot was outlined in an interview Townshend gave to ''Disc and Music Echo'' on 24 October 1970.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=250}} ''Lifehouse'' is set in the near future in a society in which music is banned and most of the population live indoors in government-controlled \"experience suits\". A rebel, Bobby, broadcasts rock music into the suits, allowing people to remove them and become more enlightened. Some elements accurately describe future technology; for example, The Grid resembles [[the internet]] and \"grid sleep\" [[virtual reality]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=273}}\n\n[[File:G-6120 2.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Pete Townshend]] was given a [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar by [[Joe Walsh]] in early 1971, and it became his main electric instrument for ''Who's Next'']]\nThe group held a press conference on 13 January 1971, explaining that they would be giving a series of concerts at the [[Young Vic]] theatre, where they would develop the fictional elements of the proposed film along with the audience.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=273}} After [[Keith Moon]] had completed his work on the film ''[[200 Motels]]'', the group performed their first Young Vic concert on 15 February. The show included a new quadrophonic [[public address system]] which cost \u00a330,000; the audience was mainly invited from various organisations such as youth clubs, with only a few tickets on sale to the general public.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=278}}\n\nAfter the initial concerts, the group flew to New York's [[Record Plant Studios]] at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group were joined by guests [[Al Kooper]] on [[Hammond organ]], [[Ken Ascher]] on piano and [[Leslie West]] on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 [[Gretsch]] guitar, given to him by [[Joe Walsh]], during the session; it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=279}} Lambert's participation in the recording was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=274}} After returning to Britain engineer [[Glyn Johns]] made safety copies of the Record Plant material, but decided that it would be better to re-record it from scratch at [[Olympic Sound Studios]] in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}}\n\nThe group gave a further series of concerts at the Young Vic on 25 and 26 April, which were recorded on the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]] by [[Andy Johns]], but Townshend grew disillusioned with ''Lifehouse'' and further shows were cancelled.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=281}} The project proved to be intractable on several levels, and caused stress within the band as well as a major falling-out between Townshend and Lambert. Years later, in the liner notes to the remastered CD, Townshend wrote that the failure of the project led him to the verge of a [[nervous breakdown]].{{sfn|Townshend|2003|p=6}} Audiences at the Young Vic gigs were not interested in interacting with the group to create new material, but simply wanted the Who to play \"[[My Generation]]\" and smash a guitar.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=377}} At the time, [[Roger Daltrey]] said the Who \"were never nearer to breaking up\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}}\n\nAlthough the ''Lifehouse'' concept was abandoned, scraps of the project remained in the final album, including the use of synthesizers and computers.{{sfn|Atkins|2003|p=13}} An early concept for ''Lifehouse'' featured the feeding of personal data from audience members into the controller of an early [[Analog signal|analogue]] synthesizer to create a \"universal chord\" that would have ended the proposed film.{{sfn|Atkins|2003|p=14}} Abandoning ''Lifehouse'' gave the group extra freedom, owing to the absence of an overriding musical theme or storyline (which had been the basis of ''Tommy''). This allowed the band to concentrate on maximising the impact of individual tracks, and providing a unifying sound for them.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=383}}\n\nAlthough he gave up his original intentions for the ''Lifehouse'' project, Townshend continued to develop the concepts, revisiting them in later albums, including a 6-CD set, ''[[The Lifehouse Chronicles]]'' in 1999.{{sfn|Townshend|2003|p=9}} In 2007, he opened a website called [[The Lifehouse Method]] to accept personal input from applicants that would be turned into musical portraits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehouse-method.com|title=The Lifehouse Method (official website)|accessdate=25 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518072215/http://www.lifehouse-method.com/|archive-date=18 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\n[[File:Olympic Studios, London.jpg|thumb|Most of ''Who's Next'' was recorded at [[Olympic Studios]], [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] with [[Glyn Johns]].]]\nThe first session for what became ''Who's Next'' was at [[Mick Jagger]]'s house, [[Stargroves]], at the start of April 1971, using the Rolling Stones Mobile. The backing track of \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" was recorded there{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} before the band decided to relocate recording to Olympic at Johns' suggestion;{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=381}} the first session was on 9 April, attempting a basic take of \"[[Bargain (song)|Bargain]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=281}} The bulk of the sessions occurred during May, when the group recorded \"Time is Passing\", \"[[Pure and Easy]]\", \"[[Love Ain't for Keeping]]\" (which had been reworked from a rock track into an acoustic arrangement), \"[[Behind Blue Eyes]]\", \"[[The Song Is Over]]\", \"[[Let's See Action]]\" and \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\". [[Nicky Hopkins]] guested on piano, while [[Dave Arbus]] was invited by Moon to play violin on \"Baba O'Riley\". [[John Entwistle]]'s \"My Wife\" was added to the album very late in the sessions, having been originally intended for a solo album.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}}\n\nIn contrast to the Record Plant and Young Vic sessions, recording with Johns went well as he was primarily concerned about creating a good sound, whereas Lambert had always been more preoccupied about the group's image. Townshend recalled, \"we were just getting astounded at the sounds Glyn was producing\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}} Townshend used the early synthesizers and modified keyboard sounds in several modes: as a [[drone (music)|drone]] effect on several songs, notably \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\",{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=382}} as well as on \"Bargain\", \"Going Mobile\" and \"The Song Is Over\". The synthesizer was used as an integral part of the sound, as opposed to providing gloss as was the case on other artists' albums up to this point.{{sfn|Atkins|2003|p=18}} Moon's drumming has a distinctly different style from earlier albums, being more formal and less reliant on long drum fills\u2014partly owing to the synthesizer backing, but also due to the no-nonsense production techniques of Johns, who insisted on a good recording performance that used flamboyance only when truly necessary.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=286}} Johns was instrumental in convincing the Who that they should simply put a single studio album out, believing the songs to be excellent. The group gave him free rein to assemble a single album of whatever songs he wanted in any order.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=382}} Despite Johns' key contributions, he only received an associate producer credit on the finished album,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}} though he maintained he acted mainly in an engineering capacity and based most of the arrangements on Townshend's original demos.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=105}}\n\n[[File:ARP 2500.jpg|thumb|left|An [[ARP Instruments|ARP]] synthesizer similar to the one used on ''Who's Next'']]\nThe album opened with \"Baba O'Riley\", featuring piano and synthesizer-processed [[Lowrey organ]] by Townshend. The song's title pays homage to Townshend's guru, [[Meher Baba]], and [[minimalism|minimalist]] composer [[Terry Riley]], and it is informally known as \"Teenage Wasteland\" from a line in the lyrics.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}} The organ track came from a longer demo by Townshend, portions of which were later included on a Baba tribute album ''I Am'',{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=386}} that was edited down for the final recording. Townshend later said this part had \"two or three thousand edits to it\".{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=108}} The opening lyrics to the next track, \"Bargain\", \"I'd gladly lose me to find you\", came from a phrase used by Baba.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}} Entwistle wrote \"My Wife\" after having an argument with his wife and exaggerating the conflict in the lyrics. The track features several overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half-hour session.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=113}} \"Pure and Easy\", a key track from ''Lifehouse'', did not make the final track selection, but the opening line was included as a coda to \"The Song is Over\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}}\n\n\"Behind Blue Eyes\" featured three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle and was written for the main antagonist in ''Lifehouse'', Brick. Moon, uncharacteristically, did not appear on the first half of the track, which was later described by Who biographer Dave Marsh as \"the longest time Keith Moon was still in his entire life.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=386}} The closing track, \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained, \"a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot of people are going to get hurt\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}} The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an [[ARP Instruments|ARP]] synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used for the finished track.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=381}}\n\n==Cover art==\nThe [[cover artwork]] shows a photograph, taken at [[Easington Colliery]], of the band apparently having just urinated on a large concrete piling protruding from a [[slag heap]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=285}} The decision to shoot the picture came from Entwistle and Moon discussing [[Stanley Kubrick]] and the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Who: Concert File |first=Joe |last=McMichael |first2=Jack |last2=Lyons |publisher=Omnibus Press |p=480 |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-857-12737-2}}</ref> According to photographer [[Ethan Russell]], only Townshend actually urinated against the piling, so rainwater was tipped from an empty film canister to achieve the desired effect.

It developed from the aborted ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' project, a multi-media [[rock opera]] written by the group's [[Pete Townshend]] as a follow-up to the band's 1969 album ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]''. The project was cancelled owing to its complexity and to conflicts with [[Kit Lambert]], the band's manager, but the group salvaged some of the songs, without the connecting story elements, to release as their next album. Eight of the nine songs on ''Who's Next'' were from ''Lifehouse'', the lone exception being the [[John Entwistle]]-penned \"My Wife\". Ultimately, the remaining ''Lifehouse'' tracks would all be released on other albums throughout the next decade.\n\nThe Who recorded ''Who's Next'' with assistance from recording engineer [[Glyn Johns]]. After producing the song \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" in the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]], they relocated to [[Olympic Studios]] to record and mix most of the album's remaining songs. They made prominent use of [[synthesizer]] on the album, particularly on \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\", which were both released as [[single (music)|singles]]. The cover photo was shot by [[Ethan Russell]]; it made reference to the [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]] in the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', as it featured group members standing by a concrete piling protruding from a [[slag heap]], apparently having urinated against it.\n\n''Who's Next'' was an immediate success when it was released in August 1971.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Who's Next |others=The Who |year=1995|origyear= 1971 |chapter=''Who's Next'' and ''The Lifehouse Project'' |first=John |last=Atkins |pages=13, 24 |type=CD liner |publisher=MCA Records |id=MCAD-11269}}</ref> It has since been viewed by many critics as the Who's best record and one of the greatest albums of all time. It was reissued on [[compact disc|CD]] several times, with additional songs originally intended for ''Lifehouse''.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Lifehouse (rock opera)}}\nBy 1970, the Who had obtained significant critical and commercial success, but they had started to become detached from their original audience. The [[mod (subculture)|mod movement]] had vanished, and the original followers from [[Shepherd's Bush]] had grown up and acquired jobs and families. The group had started to drift apart from manager [[Kit Lambert]], owing to his preoccupation with their label, [[Track Records]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=361}} They had been touring since the release of ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' the previous May, with a set that contained most of that album, but realized that millions had now seen their live performances, and [[Pete Townshend]] in particular recognized that they needed to do something new.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=363}} A single, \"[[The Seeker (The Who song)|The Seeker]]\", and a live album, ''[[Live at Leeds]]'', were released in 1970,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=358}} and an EP of new material (\"Water\", \"Naked Eye\", \"I Don't Even Know Myself\", \"Postcard\" and \"Now I'm a Farmer\") was recorded, but not released as the band felt it would not be a satisfactory follow-up to ''Tommy''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=365}}\n\nInstead, the group tackled a project called ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]''. This evolved from a series of columns Townshend wrote for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in August 1970, in which he discussed the importance of rock music, and in particular what the audience could do.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=368}} Of all the group, he was the most keen to use music as a communication device, and wanted to branch out into other media, including film, to get away from the traditional album/tour cycle.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=272}} Townshend has variously described ''Lifehouse'' as a futuristic [[rock opera]], a live-recorded [[concept album]] and as the music for a scripted film project.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=369}} The basic plot was outlined in an interview Townshend gave to ''Disc and Music Echo'' on 24 October 1970.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=250}} ''Lifehouse'' is set in the near future in a society in which music is banned and most of the population live indoors in government-controlled \"experience suits\". A rebel, Bobby, broadcasts rock music into the suits, allowing people to remove them and become more enlightened. Some elements accurately describe future technology; for example, The Grid resembles [[the internet]] and \"grid sleep\" [[virtual reality]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=273}}\n\n[[File:G-6120 2.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Pete Townshend]] was given a [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar by [[Joe Walsh]] in early 1971, and it became his main electric instrument for ''Who's Next'']]\nThe group held a press conference on 13 January 1971, explaining that they would be giving a series of concerts at the [[Young Vic]] theatre, where they would develop the fictional elements of the proposed film along with the audience.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=273}} After [[Keith Moon]] had completed his work on the film ''[[200 Motels]]'', the group performed their first Young Vic concert on 15 February. The show included a new quadrophonic [[public address system]] which cost \u00a330,000; the audience was mainly invited from various organisations such as youth clubs, with only a few tickets on sale to the general public.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=278}}\n\nAfter the initial concerts, the group flew to New York's [[Record Plant Studios]] at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group were joined by guests [[Al Kooper]] on [[Hammond organ]], [[Ken Ascher]] on piano and [[Leslie West]] on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 [[Gretsch]] guitar, given to him by [[Joe Walsh]], during the session; it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=279}} Lambert's participation in the recording was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=274}} After returning to Britain engineer [[Glyn Johns]] made safety copies of the Record Plant material, but decided that it would be better to re-record it from scratch at [[Olympic Sound Studios]] in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}}\n\nThe group gave a further series of concerts at the Young Vic on 25 and 26 April, which were recorded on the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]] by [[Andy Johns]], but Townshend grew disillusioned with ''Lifehouse'' and further shows were cancelled.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=281}} The project proved to be intractable on several levels, and caused stress within the band as well as a major falling-out between Townshend and Lambert. Years later, in the liner notes to the remastered CD, Townshend wrote that the failure of the project led him to the verge of a [[nervous breakdown]].{{sfn|Townshend|2003|p=6}} Audiences at the Young Vic gigs were not interested in interacting with the group to create new material, but simply wanted the Who to play \"[[My Generation]]\" and smash a guitar.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=377}} At the time, [[Roger Daltrey]] said the Who \"were never nearer to breaking up\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}}\n\nAlthough the ''Lifehouse'' concept was abandoned, scraps of the project remained in the final album, including the use of synthesizers and computers.{{sfn|Atkins|2003|p=13}} An early concept for ''Lifehouse'' featured the feeding of personal data from audience members into the controller of an early [[Analog signal|analogue]] synthesizer to create a \"universal chord\" that would have ended the proposed film.{{sfn|Atkins|2003|p=14}} Abandoning ''Lifehouse'' gave the group extra freedom, owing to the absence of an overriding musical theme or storyline (which had been the basis of ''Tommy''). This allowed the band to concentrate on maximising the impact of individual tracks, and providing a unifying sound for them.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=383}}\n\nAlthough he gave up his original intentions for the ''Lifehouse'' project, Townshend continued to develop the concepts, revisiting them in later albums, including a 6-CD set, ''[[The Lifehouse Chronicles]]'' in 1999.{{sfn|Townshend|2003|p=9}} In 2007, he opened a website called [[The Lifehouse Method]] to accept personal input from applicants that would be turned into musical portraits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehouse-method.com|title=The Lifehouse Method (official website)|accessdate=25 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518072215/http://www.lifehouse-method.com/|archive-date=18 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\n[[File:Olympic Studios, London.jpg|thumb|Most of ''Who's Next'' was recorded at [[Olympic Studios]], [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] with [[Glyn Johns]].]]\nThe first session for what became ''Who's Next'' was at [[Mick Jagger]]'s house, [[Stargroves]], at the start of April 1971, using the Rolling Stones Mobile. The backing track of \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" was recorded there{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} before the band decided to relocate recording to Olympic at Johns' suggestion;{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=381}} the first session was on 9 April, attempting a basic take of \"[[Bargain (song)|Bargain]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=281}} The bulk of the sessions occurred during May, when the group recorded \"Time is Passing\", \"[[Pure and Easy]]\", \"[[Love Ain't for Keeping]]\" (which had been reworked from a rock track into an acoustic arrangement), \"[[Behind Blue Eyes]]\", \"[[The Song Is Over]]\", \"[[Let's See Action]]\" and \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\". [[Nicky Hopkins]] guested on piano, while [[Dave Arbus]] was invited by Moon to play violin on \"Baba O'Riley\". [[John Entwistle]]'s \"My Wife\" was added to the album very late in the sessions, having been originally intended for a solo album.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}}\n\nIn contrast to the Record Plant and Young Vic sessions, recording with Johns went well as he was primarily concerned about creating a good sound, whereas Lambert had always been more preoccupied about the group's image. Townshend recalled, \"we were just getting astounded at the sounds Glyn was producing\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}} Townshend used the early synthesizers and modified keyboard sounds in several modes: as a [[drone (music)|drone]] effect on several songs, notably \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\",{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=382}} as well as on \"Bargain\", \"Going Mobile\" and \"The Song Is Over\". The synthesizer was used as an integral part of the sound, as opposed to providing gloss as was the case on other artists' albums up to this point.{{sfn|Atkins|2003|p=18}} Moon's drumming has a distinctly different style from earlier albums, being more formal and less reliant on long drum fills\u2014partly owing to the synthesizer backing, but also due to the no-nonsense production techniques of Johns, who insisted on a good recording performance that used flamboyance only when truly necessary.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=286}} Johns was instrumental in convincing the Who that they should simply put a single studio album out, believing the songs to be excellent. The group gave him free rein to assemble a single album of whatever songs he wanted in any order.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=382}} Despite Johns' key contributions, he only received an associate producer credit on the finished album,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=282}} though he maintained he acted mainly in an engineering capacity and based most of the arrangements on Townshend's original demos.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=105}}\n\n[[File:ARP 2500.jpg|thumb|left|An [[ARP Instruments|ARP]] synthesizer similar to the one used on ''Who's Next'']]\nThe album opened with \"Baba O'Riley\", featuring piano and synthesizer-processed [[Lowrey organ]] by Townshend. The song's title pays homage to Townshend's guru, [[Meher Baba]], and [[minimalism|minimalist]] composer [[Terry Riley]], and it is informally known as \"Teenage Wasteland\" from a line in the lyrics.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}} The organ track came from a longer demo by Townshend, portions of which were later included on a Baba tribute album ''I Am'',{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=386}} that was edited down for the final recording. Townshend later said this part had \"two or three thousand edits to it\".{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=108}} The opening lyrics to the next track, \"Bargain\", \"I'd gladly lose me to find you\", came from a phrase used by Baba.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}} Entwistle wrote \"My Wife\" after having an argument with his wife and exaggerating the conflict in the lyrics. The track features several overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half-hour session.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=113}} \"Pure and Easy\", a key track from ''Lifehouse'', did not make the final track selection, but the opening line was included as a coda to \"The Song is Over\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}}\n\n\"Behind Blue Eyes\" featured three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle and was written for the main antagonist in ''Lifehouse'', Brick. Moon, uncharacteristically, did not appear on the first half of the track, which was later described by Who biographer Dave Marsh as \"the longest time Keith Moon was still in his entire life.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=386}} The closing track, \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained, \"a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot of people are going to get hurt\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=275}} The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an [[ARP Instruments|ARP]] synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used for the finished track.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=381}}\n\n==Cover art==\nThe [[cover artwork]] shows a photograph, taken at [[Easington Colliery]], of the band apparently having just urinated on a large concrete piling protruding from a [[slag heap]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=285}} The decision to shoot the picture came from Entwistle and Moon discussing [[Stanley Kubrick]] and the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Who: Concert File |first=Joe |last=McMichael |first2=Jack |last2=Lyons |publisher=Omnibus Press |p=480 |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-857-12737-2}}</ref> According to photographer [[Ethan Russell]], only Townshend actually urinated against the piling, so rainwater was tipped from an empty film canister to achieve the desired effect.

The latter two songs involved the band playing to a [[backing track]] containing the synthesizer parts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=392}} The tour moved to the UK in September, including a show at [[The Oval]], [[Kennington]] in front of 35,000 fans, and the opening gig at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in Finsbury Park, before going back to the US, ending in [[Seattle]] on 15 December.

It was released on 15 December 1967 by [[Track Records]] in the UK and [[Decca Records]] in the US. \n\nA [[concept album]], ''The Who Sell Out'' is structured as a collection of unrelated songs interspersed with fake commercials and [[public service announcement]]s.<ref name=pc49>{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 \u2013 The British are Coming!

The reference to \"[[selling out]]\" was an intended irony, as the Who had been making real commercials during that period of their career, some of which are included as bonus tracks on the remastered CD.\n\nThe album's release was reportedly followed by lawsuits due to the mention of real-world commercial interests in the ''faux'' commercials and on the album covers, and by the makers of the real [[jingle]]s (Radio London jingles), who claimed the Who used them without permission. (The jingles were produced by [[PAMS]] Productions of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], which created thousands of [[Station identification|station ID]] jingles in the 1960s and 1970s.) It was the deodorant company, [[Odorono]], who took offence that [[Chris Stamp]] made a request for endorsement dollars.<ref>\"B.O., Baked Beans, Buns and The Who\", Rolling Stone. Vol 1 No. 3, 14 December 1967</ref> \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\" was released as a single and peaked at number 10 in the UK and number 9 in the US.\n\n''The Who Sell Out'' has received widespread acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed it as the Who's best record. It has also frequently been featured on all-time lists of the best albums, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn his book ''Maximum R & B'', Who confidant Richard Barnes claims to have come up with the idea of the band recording commercial jingles after their cover of the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] theme appeared on the ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'' EP. Barnes posited the idea to Roger Daltrey, whose similar suggestions to Pete Townshend were allegedly met with derision. <ref>{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Richard|title=Maximum R & B|date=1982|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0-85965351-X|page=45|edition=Revised, 2002}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the band's follow-up to ''[[A Quick One]]'' was to be titled ''Who's Lily'' after their recent single \"[[Pictures of Lily]].\" Early cuts such as a cover of \"Summertime Blues,\" the Coke jingles, and the instrumental \"Sodding About,\" showed the influence of Track Records label-mate [[Jimi Hendrix]] on Townshend's guitar playing.\n\nEven before the group had formed, the members of the Who had been profoundly influenced by [[rock n roll]] appearing on the radio. The BBC did not broadcast much contemporary music at the time, which was left to stations like [[Radio Luxembourg]] and then [[pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]].{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=5}} By the end of 1966, the Who had achieved commercial success owing to the [[mod (subculture)|mod movement]] that made up a significant section of the group's early audience. However, the movement was fading, and the TV show ''[[Ready, Steady, Go]]'' that had boosted the group to fame, had been cancelled.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=239}} The group started touring the US the following year, and started to achieve success with their live act.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=246}} In summer 1967, the group's managers [[Kit Lambert]] and [[Chris Stamp]] suggested the band could create a [[concept album]] based on pirate radio and structure it in the same manner as that, or a typical US AM radio station.{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=5}} As pirate radio had been influential to mods, it was felt particularly appropriate to pay tribute to it.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=172-173}} As well as the music, the inter-song announcements and [[jingle]]s were a key component of radio, so it was decided to include a selection of humorous asides on the album.{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=7}} The [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] came into effect at midnight on 14 August 1967, outlawing all pirate stations and strengthening the album's effect as a tribute.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=276}} The aspect separated the Who from their contemporaries in the developing underground rock scene, both musically and stylistically.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=173}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nThe first song to be written specifically for the concept was \"Jaguar\", paying tribute to the car, which was quickly followed by an instrumental the group had recorded for [[Coca-Cola]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=278}} \"[[Armenia City in the Sky]]\", was written by a friend of the band, [[Speedy Keen|John \"Speedy\" Keen]].{{efn|Keen later found fame as a member of [[Thunderclap Newman]] whose smash hit  [[Something in the Air (song)|\"Something in the Air\"]]  features production by Pete Townshend and bass playing from Townshend under the pseudonym Bijou Drains.}} According to music critic [[Richie Unterberger]], ''The Who Sell Out'' featured \"jubilant\" [[psychedelic pop]] music that veers between \"melodic [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] pop and powerful instrumentation\",<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/> while [[Edna Gundersen]] from ''[[USA Today]]'' said the album's style was [[power pop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-12-04-album-list_x.htm|accessdate=2 July 2013|title=Top 40 albums \u2014 the USA TODAY way|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Gundersen|first=Edna|date=5 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nHaving finished touring the US, including an appearance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], the group returned to the UK on 16 September to start recording. They made progress on the album for the next three weeks; the first song to be completed was the single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", released the following month.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=273}} By October, the group had also completed \"Armenia City in the Sky\", \"Early Morning Cold Taxi\" and \"Girl's Eyes\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=179}} \"Heinz Baked Beans\", \"Odorono\" and \"Top Gear\" had been completed mid-month, along with a series of linking adverts and jingles mostly recorded by Entwistle and Moon.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=180}} \"Tattoo\", \"Odorono\" and \"Rael\" were completed by 20 October, {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=181}} while most of the remainder of the album was recorded in between live shows at the end of the month.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=183}} \"Sunrise\", a solo Townshend piece, was the last piece to be recorded on 2 November. The album was mixed by Lambert and Damon Lyon-Shaw intermittently throughout November, coming up with a finished master on the 20th.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=184}}\n\n==Packaging==\nThe cover is divided into panels featuring a photograph by [[David Montgomery (photographer)|David Montgomery]] of each of the band members, two on the front and two on the back. On the front is [[Pete Townshend]] applying Odorono brand [[deodorant]] from an oversized stick, and [[Roger Daltrey]] sitting in a [[bathtub]] full of [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] baked beans (holding an oversized tin can of the same). Daltrey claims to have caught [[pneumonia]] after sitting for a prolonged period in the bathtub, as the beans had been frozen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7951056.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Roger Daltrey's concert conundrum|publisher=}}</ref> On the back is [[Keith Moon]] applying Medac (a fictitious [[acne]] ointment) from an oversized tube, and [[John Entwistle]] in a leopard-skin ''[[Tarzan]]'' suit, squeezing a blonde woman in a leopard-skin bikini with one arm and a [[teddy bear]] with the other (an ad for the [[Angelo Siciliano|Charles Atlas]] course mentioned in one of the album's fake commercials).\n\nOriginal vinyl copies of ''Sell Out'' end with an audio oddity that repeats into a [[locked groove]] (In response to [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''). The music in the locked groove is an instrumental version of what was originally intended to be a vocal jingle for the Who's UK label [[Track Records]].\n\nWhen the LP was released on Track Records in the UK in 1967 (Track 612 002 Mono & Track 613 002 Stereo), a poster was included inside the first 1000 copies (500 stereo and 500 mono). They came with a sticker on the front cover stating 'Free Psychedelic Poster Inside'. Because of their rarity, first pressings with poster and sticker have sold for more than \u00a3600. Included in the inner sleeve of the 1995 MCA CD reissue; the poster art of a butterfly initially intended as the LP cover was scrapped, and turned into the free poster.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Who - Posters|url=http://www.thewho.info/Posters2.htm|accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| title = Retrospective professional ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|year=2011|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=0857125958|edition=5th|chapter=The Who}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Muze\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev4Score = 9/10<ref name=\"Muze\"/>\n| rev5 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev5Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Muze\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rakuten.com/prod/who-sell-out/210877706.html|title=Who Sell Out CD|publisher=[[Rakuten.com]].

The reference to \"[[selling out]]\" was an intended irony, as the Who had been making real commercials during that period of their career, some of which are included as bonus tracks on the remastered CD.\n\nThe album's release was reportedly followed by lawsuits due to the mention of real-world commercial interests in the ''faux'' commercials and on the album covers, and by the makers of the real [[jingle]]s (Radio London jingles), who claimed the Who used them without permission. (The jingles were produced by [[PAMS]] Productions of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], which created thousands of [[Station identification|station ID]] jingles in the 1960s and 1970s.) It was the deodorant company, [[Odorono]], who took offence that [[Chris Stamp]] made a request for endorsement dollars.<ref>\"B.O., Baked Beans, Buns and The Who\", Rolling Stone. Vol 1 No. 3, 14 December 1967</ref> \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\" was released as a single and peaked at number 10 in the UK and number 9 in the US.\n\n''The Who Sell Out'' has received widespread acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed it as the Who's best record. It has also frequently been featured on all-time lists of the best albums, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn his book ''Maximum R & B'', Who confidant Richard Barnes claims to have come up with the idea of the band recording commercial jingles after their cover of the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] theme appeared on the ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'' EP. Barnes posited the idea to Roger Daltrey, whose similar suggestions to Pete Townshend were allegedly met with derision. <ref>{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Richard|title=Maximum R & B|date=1982|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0-85965351-X|page=45|edition=Revised, 2002}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the band's follow-up to ''[[A Quick One]]'' was to be titled ''Who's Lily'' after their recent single \"[[Pictures of Lily]].\" Early cuts such as a cover of \"Summertime Blues,\" the Coke jingles, and the instrumental \"Sodding About,\" showed the influence of Track Records label-mate [[Jimi Hendrix]] on Townshend's guitar playing.\n\nEven before the group had formed, the members of the Who had been profoundly influenced by [[rock n roll]] appearing on the radio. The BBC did not broadcast much contemporary music at the time, which was left to stations like [[Radio Luxembourg]] and then [[pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]].{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=5}} By the end of 1966, the Who had achieved commercial success owing to the [[mod (subculture)|mod movement]] that made up a significant section of the group's early audience. However, the movement was fading, and the TV show ''[[Ready, Steady, Go]]'' that had boosted the group to fame, had been cancelled.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=239}} The group started touring the US the following year, and started to achieve success with their live act.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=246}} In summer 1967, the group's managers [[Kit Lambert]] and [[Chris Stamp]] suggested the band could create a [[concept album]] based on pirate radio and structure it in the same manner as that, or a typical US AM radio station.{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=5}} As pirate radio had been influential to mods, it was felt particularly appropriate to pay tribute to it.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=172-173}} As well as the music, the inter-song announcements and [[jingle]]s were a key component of radio, so it was decided to include a selection of humorous asides on the album.{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=7}} The [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] came into effect at midnight on 14 August 1967, outlawing all pirate stations and strengthening the album's effect as a tribute.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=276}} The aspect separated the Who from their contemporaries in the developing underground rock scene, both musically and stylistically.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=173}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nThe first song to be written specifically for the concept was \"Jaguar\", paying tribute to the car, which was quickly followed by an instrumental the group had recorded for [[Coca-Cola]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=278}} \"[[Armenia City in the Sky]]\", was written by a friend of the band, [[Speedy Keen|John \"Speedy\" Keen]].{{efn|Keen later found fame as a member of [[Thunderclap Newman]] whose smash hit  [[Something in the Air (song)|\"Something in the Air\"]]  features production by Pete Townshend and bass playing from Townshend under the pseudonym Bijou Drains.}} According to music critic [[Richie Unterberger]], ''The Who Sell Out'' featured \"jubilant\" [[psychedelic pop]] music that veers between \"melodic [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] pop and powerful instrumentation\",<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/> while [[Edna Gundersen]] from ''[[USA Today]]'' said the album's style was [[power pop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-12-04-album-list_x.htm|accessdate=2 July 2013|title=Top 40 albums \u2014 the USA TODAY way|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Gundersen|first=Edna|date=5 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nHaving finished touring the US, including an appearance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], the group returned to the UK on 16 September to start recording. They made progress on the album for the next three weeks; the first song to be completed was the single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", released the following month.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=273}} By October, the group had also completed \"Armenia City in the Sky\", \"Early Morning Cold Taxi\" and \"Girl's Eyes\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=179}} \"Heinz Baked Beans\", \"Odorono\" and \"Top Gear\" had been completed mid-month, along with a series of linking adverts and jingles mostly recorded by Entwistle and Moon.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=180}} \"Tattoo\", \"Odorono\" and \"Rael\" were completed by 20 October, {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=181}} while most of the remainder of the album was recorded in between live shows at the end of the month.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=183}} \"Sunrise\", a solo Townshend piece, was the last piece to be recorded on 2 November. The album was mixed by Lambert and Damon Lyon-Shaw intermittently throughout November, coming up with a finished master on the 20th.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=184}}\n\n==Packaging==\nThe cover is divided into panels featuring a photograph by [[David Montgomery (photographer)|David Montgomery]] of each of the band members, two on the front and two on the back. On the front is [[Pete Townshend]] applying Odorono brand [[deodorant]] from an oversized stick, and [[Roger Daltrey]] sitting in a [[bathtub]] full of [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] baked beans (holding an oversized tin can of the same). Daltrey claims to have caught [[pneumonia]] after sitting for a prolonged period in the bathtub, as the beans had been frozen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7951056.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Roger Daltrey's concert conundrum|publisher=}}</ref> On the back is [[Keith Moon]] applying Medac (a fictitious [[acne]] ointment) from an oversized tube, and [[John Entwistle]] in a leopard-skin ''[[Tarzan]]'' suit, squeezing a blonde woman in a leopard-skin bikini with one arm and a [[teddy bear]] with the other (an ad for the [[Angelo Siciliano|Charles Atlas]] course mentioned in one of the album's fake commercials).\n\nOriginal vinyl copies of ''Sell Out'' end with an audio oddity that repeats into a [[locked groove]] (In response to [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''). The music in the locked groove is an instrumental version of what was originally intended to be a vocal jingle for the Who's UK label [[Track Records]].\n\nWhen the LP was released on Track Records in the UK in 1967 (Track 612 002 Mono & Track 613 002 Stereo), a poster was included inside the first 1000 copies (500 stereo and 500 mono). They came with a sticker on the front cover stating 'Free Psychedelic Poster Inside'. Because of their rarity, first pressings with poster and sticker have sold for more than \u00a3600. Included in the inner sleeve of the 1995 MCA CD reissue; the poster art of a butterfly initially intended as the LP cover was scrapped, and turned into the free poster.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Who - Posters|url=http://www.thewho.info/Posters2.htm|accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| title = Retrospective professional ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|year=2011|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=0857125958|edition=5th|chapter=The Who}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Muze\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev4Score = 9/10<ref name=\"Muze\"/>\n| rev5 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev5Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Muze\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rakuten.com/prod/who-sell-out/210877706.html|title=Who Sell Out CD|publisher=[[Rakuten.com]].
