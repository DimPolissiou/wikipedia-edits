In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup, removed blank lines.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}
{"title_page": "Alkiza", "text_new": "[[File:Alkiza, Euskal Herria.JPG|thumb|Alkiza]]\n'''Alkiza''' is a rural municipality in the centre of [[Gipuzkoa]], northwest of the [[Tolosaldea]] County, in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country.]] It is 27 kilometres south of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]]. In 2019 it had 373 inhabitants, of which 88.8% were Basque speakers. Alkiza is an independent municipality since 1731; previously it depended on [[Tolosa, Gipuzkoa|Tolosa]] and San Sebastian.\n\nAlkiza is connected with [[Anoeta]] and [[Asteasu]] through the GI-3630 road. The Asteasu branch was inaugurated in 1952 and the Anoeta branch in 1957. Until then, farm roads and paths linked Alkiza with the nearby villages.\n\nThe village is 340 meters above sea level and there are the school, the town hall, the pelota-court and the parish church. The municipality has more than 40 scattered farms and houses.\n\nIts inhabitants are nicknamed in Basque ''oiloak'' (chickens).\n\nThe village\u2019s main festival is on September 8.\n\n== Geography ==\nAlkiza is located in the east of [[Hernio|Hernio-Gazume]] massif. The municipal area is mostly steep, with the flattest area in ''Arana'' neighborhood.\n\nThe local climate is typically [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]].\n\nAs Hernio is a limestone formation, there are in Alkiza numerous [[karst]] structures such as [[Cave|caves]], chasms and [[sinkholes]]. The ''Leize Haundia 2 / Sabe-saia'' complex is the most important karst structure in Alkiza. The two caves form a system 340 m deep, 2 km of galleries and a stream inside<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galan|first=Carlos &, Villota, Jaime|date=|title=Complejo Leize-Aundia - Sabe-Saia|url=|journal=Munibe|volume=XXII|pages=175 -182|via=}}</ref>.\n\nThe most outstanding summits in the municipality are Herniozabal (1,010 m), Herniotxiki (820 m), Enaizpuru (731 m), Alluts (687 m) and Beleburu (619 m) to the west and Mendiola (431 m) to the east. \n\nA quarter of the surface of Hernio-Gazume Special Conservation Zone ([[Natura 2000|Nature 2000]]) is located in the municipality of Alkiza.\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nAs mentioned above, Alkiza is a karst area, so the rain and thaw waters go underground to a large extent. For this reason, some streams and creeks only carry water in the event of intense precipitation and, in others, there are surface waters only in some sections of the course.\n\nThere are two main streams in Alkiza:\n\n* ''Mandabe'' stream runs through ''Arana'' neighborhood and discharges its waters in Anoeta to [[Oria (river)|Oria]] river. It is born in the source called ''Bidania erreka'', where the waters of the ''Leize / Haundia 2 / Sabe-saia'' complex emerge. Among the inhabitants of Alkiza it was thought that the waters of this source came from the other side of Hernio, specifically from the village of [[Bidania-Goiatz|Bidania]], and hence its name.\n* ''Aranguren'' stream is born next to the farmhouse of the same name and runs through ''Aldapa'' neighborhood.\u00a0 It pours its waters into Asteasu stream, a tributary of Oria river. This stream is called ''Arraiaga'' downstream of the ''Egurrola'' bridge.\n\n=== Adjacent municipalities ===\nAlkiza limits to the north with [[Larraul]] and Asteasu; to the south with [[Hernialde]], Tolosa, [[Albiztur]] and Bidania-Goiatz; to the east with Anoeta; and to the west with [[Errezil]].\n\n== History ==\nThe first human footprints in Alkiza date back to the [[Bronze Age]]. Ceramic pieces in the Olatzazpi cave and the [[Tumulus|burial mound]] of the place called Itzuregi are an example of this.\n\nThe first written references to Alkiza are from 1348. In fact, by order of the King of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]], the list of noblemen of Tolosa was drawn up. In this list there are several Alkiza households. Alkiza is mentioned administratively associated to Tolosa. In 1396 Tolosa recognized Alkiza the right to choose its judges. Because of taxes Alkiza and other villages of Tolosaldea had disputes with Tolosa since 1435. Within this process, in 1450, Alkiza decided to join San Sebasti\u00e1n, but this did not materialize legally until in 1479.\n\nBetween the XV and XVIII centuries, Alkiza self-governed as an open council, although judges and aldermen were also appointed for everyday decisions.\n\nAt the end of the first third of the 18th century, the most important moment in the history of Alkiza arrived: it became a municipality. On January 21, 1731, Alkiza was declared a villa by King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] and separated from San Sebasti\u00e1n. The distance to San Sebasti\u00e1n was the most important reason to carry out this secession. Miguel Irazusta was the first mayor. That same year, the limits of Alqiiza with the villages in the area were officially defined and each of the cairns was signalled. The Asteasu boundary, for example, was delimited by the cairns of ''Olatza, Arizmendi, Zalminaga'' and ''Arraiaga''. 54 houses constituted the new municipality.\n\nBy becoming an independent municipality, Alkiza acquired the right to participate in the [[General Assembly of Gipuzkoa]]. This had an economic cost and Alkiza proposed Anoeta to join and to share expenses. In 1742 the two villages founded the ''Ainssu'' union for their representation in the General Assembly. In 1815 Hernialde joined Ainssu and the enlarged union was called ''Ainssuberreluz''.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the [[communal land]] was privatized in Alkiza. The first movement occurred because of the debts derived from the [[War of the Pyrenees|War of the Convention]], and so in 1797 the local assembly authorized the City Council to sell communal land. The first auction of communal land was held in 1799 and the City Council sold 53 lots. From that date until 1814 the City Council held six auctions for the alienation of communal land. In 1810, other goods were auctioned, such as the ''Olaa'' and ''Goiko Errota'' mills in ''Aldapa'' neighborhood and ''Igaran'' in ''Arana'' neighborhood. At the end of the 18th century, half of the municipality's land was public and between 1799 and 1845 the City Council auctioned 682 communal plots, 5.3 km<sup>2</sup>. The communal land was reduced to an area of 0.4 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThis privatization seriously affected the economy of the city council. In fact, the council obtained great economic resources by selling firewood, charcoal, chestnuts and others. This caused, for example, in 1801 the loss of the resident [[Notary|notaries]] that Alkiza had since 1749. The forest guards responsible for the municipal forests and nurseries also disappeared.\n\nThe two [[Carlist Wars|Carlist wars]] of the 19th century had little effect on Alkiza. Although, in the Third Carlist War, the so-called Alkiza encounter happened in 1873. The Carlist guerrilla leader Santa Cruz priest was suspected to be somewhere in Hernio area and the ''miqueletes'' (police corp) and the liberal troops went looking for him. They found no one and decided to descend from Zelatun pass to Alkiza. Upon entering the village they were greeted with shots, but the liberals expelled the Carlists carrying a charge in bayonet. On the other hand, it was frequent that Santa Cruz took shelter in the priest's house of Alkiza, whose parish priest was a fervent Carlist.\n\nThe mail service started in 1873 with two postmen. One of them made the Azpeitia-Alquiza-Larraul-Asteasu route and the other, Tolosa-Alquiza-Larraul-Asteasu.\n\nIn 1885 the city council decided to bring up the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] and [[telephone]] to the village. These services were based in the municipal tavern. The phone was not extended to all households in the municipality until the beginning of the decade of 1980.\n\nin 1911 four local entrepreneurs built a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power station]] in the course of Mandabe stream. In this way, households of Alkiza were supplied with electric power. This plant was a pioneer of the current ''Elektralkiza'' hydroelectrid power station. Alkiza was supplied with electrical energy produced by Mandabe stream until 1971 when the Spanish large power company ''Iberduero'' installed two transformation centers in the municipality.\nThe first motorcar arrived in Alkiza on November 2, 1930.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline}}\n* [http://www.alkiza.eus Official Website] Information available in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]].\n* [http://www.euskomedia.org/euskomedia/SAunamendi?idi=en&op=7&voz=ALKIZA ALKIZA in the Bernardo Estorn\u00e9s Lasa - Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia (Euskomedia Fundazioa)] Information available in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n\n{{Municipalities in Gipuzkoa}}\n\n{{coord|43|10|21|N|2|06|32|W|display=title|source:eswiki}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities in Gipuzkoa]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Gipuzkoa]]\n\n\n{{basque-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:Alkiza, Euskal Herria.JPG|thumb|Alkiza]]\n'''Alkiza''' is a rural municipality in the centre of [[Gipuzkoa]], northwest of the [[Tolosaldea]] County, in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country.]] It is 27 kilometres south of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]].

The battle was fought on July 21, 1861 in [[Prince William County, Virginia]], just north of the city of [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] and about 25 miles west-southwest of [[Washington, D.C.]] The [[Union Army|Union]]'s forces were slow in positioning themselves, allowing [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] reinforcements time to arrive by rail. Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle. It was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces.\n\nJust months after the start of the war at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], the  Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]], which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy. Yielding to political pressure, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] led his unseasoned Union Army across [[Bull Run (Occoquan River)|Bull Run]] against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage.\n\nConfederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]], stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\". The Confederates launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout. McDowell's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C.\n\nBoth armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties, and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated. The First Battle of Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war. Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was minimal, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively. McDowell, with 35,000 men, was only able to commit about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, committed only 18,000.<ref>Ballard, p. v.

Earlier, South Carolina and seven other\nSouthern states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.\n \nTo suppress the Confederacy and restore Federal law in the Southern states, Lincoln called for [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 volunteers]] with ninety-day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000. He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three-year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to almost 20,000. Lincoln's actions caused four more Southern states, including Virginia, to secede and join the Confederacy, and by 1 June the Confederate capital had been moved from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond, Virginia.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., as thousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital, General in Chief Lt. Gen. [[Winfield Scott]] laid out his strategy to subdue the Confederate States. He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized and sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans. While the Army \"strangled\" the Confederacy in the west, the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts. The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott's \"[[Anaconda Plan]]\". Instead, many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond, only one hundred miles south of Washington, would quickly end the war.<ref>Ballard, 3.</ref>\nBy July 1861 thousands of volunteers were camped in and around Washington. Since General Scott was seventy-five years old and physically unable to lead this force, the administration searched for a more suitable field commander.<ref>Ballard, 4.</ref>\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott by Fredricks, 1862.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Lt.

It is sometimes called the \"[[Anaconda plan]]\".]]\n\n===Irvin McDowell===\nSecretary of the Treasury [[Salmon P. Chase]] championed fellow Ohioan, 42-year-old Maj. [[Irvin McDowell]]. Although McDowell was a [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate, his command experience was limited. In fact, he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General's Office. While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase, a former Ohio governor and senator. Now, through Chase's influence, McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command (by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia, which included the military forces in and around Washington ([[Army of the Potomac|Army of Northeastern Virginia]]).<ref>Ballard, p. 4.</ref> McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia, 35,000 men arranged in five divisions. Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations, McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops. Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments, but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level. He was reassured by President Lincoln, \"You are green, it is true, but they are green also; you are all green alike.\"<ref>Detzer, p. 77; Williams, p. 21; McPherson, p. 336; Davis, p. 110, attributes the remark to general-in-chief [[Winfield Scott]].</ref> Against his better judgment, McDowell commenced campaigning.\n\n===Intelligence===\nDuring the previous year, U.S. Army captain [[Thomas Jordan (general)|Thomas Jordan]] set up a pro-Southern spy network in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington City]], including [[Rose O'Neal Greenhow]], a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts.<ref name=\"fishel\">Fishel, Edwin C., ''The Secret War For The Union: The Untold Story of Military Intelligence in the Civil War'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1996, pp. 59\u201363</ref> He provided her with a code for messages.<ref name=\"bioArc\">[https://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/AdvancedSearchForm \"Greenhow, Rose O'Neal\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120211241/https://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/AdvancedSearchForm |date=January 20, 2016 }}, (1817\u20131864), ''The National Archives \u2013 People Description''. 1817\u20131864, (accessed February 5, 2013)</ref> After he left to join the Confederate Army, he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her.<ref name=\"fishel\"/> On July 9 and 16, 1861, Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General [[P.G.T.

He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the [[Rappahannock River]], the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital.<ref>Davis, pp. 110\u2013111.</ref> McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water, regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.<ref>Ballard, p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe [[Confederate Army of the Potomac]] (21,883 effectives)<ref name=Livermore>Livermore, p. 77.</ref> under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction, approximately 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) from the United States capital. McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army. Union [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Robert Patterson]]'s 18,000 men engaged Johnston's force (the [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] at 8,884 effectives, augmented by Maj. Gen. [[Theophilus H. Holmes]]'s [[brigade]] of 1,465<ref name=Livermore />) in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard.\n\n[[File:Battle of Bull Run.jpg|thumb|400px|Movements July 16\u201321, 1861]]\n[[File:First Bull Run July18.png|thumb|400px|Situation July 18]]\n[[File:ATLAS OR BATTLEFIELD MANASSAS.jpg|thumb|400px|Battlefield of Manassas]]\n\nAfter two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat, the Union army was allowed to rest in [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]]. McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. [[Theodore Runyon]] with 5,000 troops to protect the army's rear. In the meantime, McDowell searched for a way to [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] Beauregard, who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run. On July 18, the Union commander sent a [[division (military)|division]] under Brig. Gen. [[Daniel Tyler]] to pass on the Confederate right (southeast) flank. Tyler was drawn into a [[Battle of Blackburn's Ford|skirmish at Blackburn's Ford]] over Bull Run and made no headway. Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard's assistance if possible. Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon, while Stuart's cavalry screened the movement from Patterson. Patterson was completely deceived. One hour after Johnston's departure Patterson telegraphed Washington, \"I have succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief, in keeping General Johnston's force at Winchester.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 9.</ref>\n\nFor the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly. He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction. If the rumors were true, McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates, instead\nof 22,000. Another reason for quick action was McDowell's concern that the ninety-day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire. \"In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force\", he wrote Washington on the eve of battle. In fact, the next morning two units of McDowell's command, their enlistments expiring that day, would turn\na deaf ear to McDowell's appeal to stay a few days longer. Instead, to the sounds of battle, they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service.<ref>Ballard, p. 10.</ref>\n\nBecoming more frustrated, McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left (northwest) flank instead. He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. [[Daniel Tyler]]'s division at the [[Stone Bridge (Manassas)|Stone Bridge]] on the [[U.S. Route 29|Warrenton Turnpike]] and send the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[David Hunter]] and [[Samuel P. Heintzelman]] over Sudley Springs Ford. From here, these divisions could outflank the Confederate line and march into the Confederate rear. The brigade of [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Israel B. Richardson]] (Tyler's Division) would harass the enemy at Blackburn's Ford, preventing them from thwarting the main attack. Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area. Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan, it had a number of flaws: it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks, skills that had not been developed in the nascent army; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take; finally, McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston's Valley force, who had trained under [[Stonewall Jackson]], was able to board trains at [[Delaplane, Virginia|Piedmont Station]] and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard's men.<ref>Eicher, pp. 91\u2013100.</ref>\n\n===Prelude to battle===\nOn July 19\u201320, significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run. Johnston arrived with all of his army, except for the troops of Brig. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith|Kirby Smith]], who were still in transit. Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn's Ford, and Beauregard's plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville. Johnston, the senior officer, approved the plan. If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously, it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other's left flank.<ref>Eicher, p. 92.</ref>\n\nMcDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents, so he called for the balloon [[Enterprise (balloon)|''Enterprise'']], which was being demonstrated by Prof. [[Thaddeus S.

Tyler's division (about 8,000) marched directly toward the Stone Bridge. The inexperienced units immediately developed logistical problems. Tyler's division blocked the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike. The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate, little more than a cart path in some places, and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9:30&nbsp;a.m. Tyler's men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m.<ref>Beatie, pp. 285\u201388; Esposito, text for Map 21; Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 312.</ref>\n\nAt 5:15&nbsp;a.m., Richardson's brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell's Ford on the Confederate right, some of which hit Beauregard's headquarters in the [[Wilmer McLean]] house as he was eating breakfast, alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted. Nevertheless, he ordered [[demonstration (military)|demonstration attacks]] north toward the Union left at Centreville. Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution. Although he intended for Brig. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] to lead the attack, Ewell, at Union Mills Ford, was simply ordered to \"hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment's notice\". Brig. Gen. [[David Rumph Jones|D.R. Jones]] was supposed to attack in support of Ewell, but found himself moving forward alone.

[[Nathan George Evans|Nathan \"Shanks\" Evans]] and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men.<ref name=Rafuse312>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 312.</ref> Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. [[Robert C. Schenck]] were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain [[Edward Porter Alexander]], Beauregard's signal officer, observing from {{convert|8|mi|km}} southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of [[Wig-Wag Signaling|wig-wag semaphore signaling]] in combat, Alexander sent the message \"Look out for your left, your position is turned.\"<ref>Brown, pp. 43\u201345; Alexander, pp. 50\u201351.

After Wheat's command was thrown back, and Wheat seriously wounded, Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. [[Barnard Elliott Bee, Jr.|Barnard Bee]] and Col. [[Francis S. Bartow]], bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men.<ref name=Rafuse312 /> They successfully slowed Hunter's lead brigade (Brig. Gen.

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]], crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders. This surprise attack, coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj. [[George Sykes]], collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11:30&nbsp;a.m., sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", pp. 312\u201313; Rafuse, ''A Single Grand Victory\", p. 131; Esposito, Map 22; Eicher, pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\n(''Further map details, see:'' '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map4.jpg|Additional Map 4]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map5.jpg|Additional Map 5]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map6.jpg|Additional Map 6]]''' and '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map7.jpg|Additional Map 7]]'''.)\n\n===Noon phase===\n\n====Henry House Hill====\nAs they retreated from their Matthews Hill position, the remainder of Evans's, Bee's, and Bartow's commands received some cover from [[Captain (Confederate Army)|Capt.]] [[John D. Imboden]] and his battery of four 6-pounder guns, who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill. They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard, who had just arrived from Johnston's headquarters at the M.

Gen [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]]'s [[Stonewall Brigade|Virginia Brigade]] came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon, accompanied by Col. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and his [[Hampton's Legion]], and Col. [[J.E.B. Stuart]]'s cavalry along with a contingent of 6-pounder guns. The Hampton Legion, some 600 men strong, managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman's advancing brigade. Hampton had purchased about 400 British Enfield rifles to equip the men with, however it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle. If so, they would have been the only foreign-made weapons on the field. The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton's musket fire and began to disintegrate. Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel, James Cameron, and remarked \"Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they won't follow him.\" Shortly afterwards, Cameron, the brother of US Senator [[Simon Cameron]], was fatally wounded. It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day, although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York.\n\nJackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill, where they were shielded from direct fire, and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line, which he posted on the crest of the hill; as the guns fired, their recoil moved them down the reverse slope, where they could be safely reloaded.<ref>Salmon, p. 19.</ref> Meanwhile, McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across {{convert|300|yd|m}} against Jackson's 13. Unlike many engagements in the Civil War, here the Confederate artillery had an advantage. The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges, with many shots fired over the head of their targets.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 314.</ref>\n\n[[File:HenryHouseBullRun1861.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of Judith Henry's house, \"Spring Hill\", after the battle]]\n\n[[File:Judith Henry farmhouse, Manassas, VA IMG 4319.JPG|right|thumb|Postwar house on site of Judith Henry house in Manassas]]\n\n[[File:Judith Henry grave, Mansasas, VA IMG 4318.JPG|right|thumb|Judith Henry grave]]\n\nOne of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry, an 85-year-old widow and invalid, who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House. As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire, he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building. A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow's feet and inflicted multiple injuries, from which she died later that day.<ref>Detzer, p. 357; Davis, pp. 204\u201305.</ref>\n\n\"The Enemy are driving us\", Bee exclaimed to Jackson. Jackson, a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], is said to have replied, \"Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet.\"<ref>Robertson, p. 264.</ref> Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, \"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians.\"<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, p. 82; Robertson, p. 264. McPherson, p. 342, reports the quotation after \"stone wall\" as being \"Rally around the Virginians!\"</ref> This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade's]]) nickname, \"Stonewall\". Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day, thus it is unclear exactly what he meant, moreover none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle. Col. [[States Rights Gist]], serving as Bee's aide-de-camp, took command of the brigade. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: \"Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!\"<ref>See, for instance, McPherson, p. 342. There are additional controversies about what Bee said and whether he said anything at all. See Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 733\u201334.</ref>\n\nArtillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line, hoping to provide [[enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire against the Confederates. At approximately 3 p.m., these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia, whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms, causing Griffin's commander, Maj. [[William Farquhar Barry|William F. Barry]], to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them. Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia followed by Stuart's cavalry attack against the flank of the [[11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] ([[Elmer E. Ellsworth|Ellsworth]]'s Fire [[Zouave]]s), which was supporting the battery, killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry. Capitalizing on this success, Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts's guns and they were captured as well. As additional Federal infantry engaged, the Confederates were pushed back and they reformed and the guns changed hands several times.<ref>Eicher, pp. 96\u201398; Esposito, Map 23; Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", pp. 314\u201315; McPherson, pp. 342\u201344.</ref>\n\n[[File:MNBPRickettsBatteryPainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Capture of Ricketts' Battery'', painting by Sidney E.

Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill, outnumbering the Confederates two to one, no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously. Jackson continued to press his attacks, telling soldiers of the [[4th Virginia Infantry]], \"Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!\" For the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the [[Rebel yell]]. At about 4 p.m., the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. [[Philip St. George Cocke]]'s brigade.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 315; Eicher, p. 98.</ref>\n\nTo the west, Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. [[Oliver Otis Howard]]'s brigade from Heintzelman's division. But at 4 p.m., two Confederate brigades-Col. [[Jubal Early]]'s, which had moved from the Confederate right, and  Brig. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]'s (commanded by Col. [[Arnold Elzey]] after Smith was wounded), which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valley, moved forward and crushed Howard's brigade. Beauregard ordered his entire line forward, and the Union troops began to panic in retreat. At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell's army was disintegrating. Thousands, in large and small groups or as individuals, began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville in a rout. McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers, but most had had enough. Unable to stop the mass exodus, McDowell gave orders for Porter's [[Regular army|regular]] infantry battalion, near the intersection of the turnpike and\nManassas-Sudley Road, to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew. The unit briefly held the crossroads, then retreated eastward with the rest of the army.<ref>Ballard, p. 32.</ref> McDowell's force crumbled and began to retreat.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", pp. 315\u201316.</ref>\n\n(''Further map details, see:'' '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map8.jpg|Additional Map 8]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map9.jpg|Additional Map 9]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map10.jpg|Additional Map 10]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map11.jpg|Additional Map 11]]''' and '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map12.jpg|Additional Map 12]]'''.)\n\n===Union retreat===\nThe retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings, but it was poorly managed by the Union officers. A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell's force. As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville, discarding their arms and equipment, McDowell ordered Col. [[Dixon S. Miles]]'s division to act as a rear guard, but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington. In the disorder that followed, hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner. Wagons and artillery were abandoned, including the 30-pounder Parrott rifle, which had opened the battle with such fanfare. Expecting an easy Union victory, the wealthy elite of nearby Washington, including congressmen and their families, had come to picnic and watch the battle. When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder, the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages.<ref>McPherson, p. 344; Eicher, p. 98; Esposito, Map 24.</ref>  The pell-mell retreat became known in the Southern press as \u201cThe Great Skedaddle.\u201d<ref>https://historicaldigression.com/2011/07/28/bull-run-and-the-art-of-the-skedaddle/; retrieved Jan. 31, 2019</ref><ref>http://www.thehistoryreader.com/modern-history/july-21-1861-first-major-battle-civil-war/; retrieved Jan. 31, 2019</ref>\n\nSince their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well, Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage, despite urging from [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating. An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank, using the brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Milledge L. Bonham]] and [[James Longstreet]], was a failure. The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham's men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard, and found that Richardson's brigade blocked the road to Centreville, he called off the pursuit.<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, p. 76; Esposito, Map 24; Davis, p. 149.</ref>\n\nIn Washington President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory. Instead, a telegram arrived stating \"General McDowell's army in full retreat through Centreville. The day is lost. Save Washington and the remnants of this army.\" The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital. From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond, \"We have won a glorious but dear-bought victory. Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Brief observations===\nFirst Bull Run was a clash between relatively large, ill-trained bodies of recruits, led by inexperienced officers. Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle, only 18,000 had actually been engaged. Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield, he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades, instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole. Other factors contributed to McDowell's defeat: Patterson's failure to hold Johnston in the valley; McDowell's two-day delay at Centreville; allowing Tyler's division to lead the march on 21 July thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman; and the 2 1/2-hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews' Hill, which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill. On Henry Hill Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level, generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves. Johnston's decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory. Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time, almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle. After reaching Manassas Junction, Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard, but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive.<ref>Ballard, pp. 35\u201336.</ref> Jackson and Bee's brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle; Jackson's brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50% casualties.\n\n===Detailed casualties===\nBull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up to that point. Union casualties were 460 killed, 1,124 wounded, and 1,312 missing or captured; Confederate casualties were 387 killed, 1,582 wounded, and 13 missing.<ref name=\"Eicher, p. 99\">Eicher, p. 99.</ref> Among the Union dead was Col. [[James Cameron (Union colonel)|James Cameron]], brother of President Lincoln's first [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[Simon Cameron]].<ref>Detzer, pp. 434\u2013435.</ref> Among the Confederate casualties was Col. [[Francis S. Bartow]], who was the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War. General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day.<ref>Detzer, p. 383.</ref>\nCompared to later battles, casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy. Both Union and Confederate killed, wounded, and missing were a little over one thousand seven hundred each.<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\">Ballard, p. 36.</ref> Two Confederate brigade commanders, Jackson and Edmund Kirby-Smith, were wounded in the battle. Jackson was shot in the hand, so he remained on the battlefield. No Union officers above the regimental level were killed; two division commanders (Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter), and one brigade commander (Orlando Willcox) were wounded.\n\n====Union====\n''Union casualties at the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.''<ref name=UFC/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ <u>ARMY OF NORTHEASTERN VIRGINIA</u>\n|-\n|-\n! scope=col rowspan=2 | Troops\n! scope=col colspan=2 | Killed\n! scope=col colspan=2 | Wounded\n! scope=col colspan=2 | Missing\n! scope=col rowspan=2 | Remarks\n|-\n! scope=col | Officers\n! scope=col | Enlisted Men\n! scope=col | Officers\n! scope=col | Enlisted Men\n! scope=col | Officers\n! scope=col | Enlisted Men\n|-\n! scope=row | General staff\n| 1 ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|\n|-\n! scope=row | First Division, General TYLER:\n| colspan=6 |\n|\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | First Brigade, Colonel Keyes\n| || 19 || 4 || 46 || 5 || 149\n| Eighteen others slightly wounded.\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | Second Brigade, General Schenck\n| 3 || 16 ||  || 15 || 1 || 15\n|\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | Third Brigade, Colonel Sherman\n| 3 || 117 || 15 || 193 || 13 || 240\n|\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | Fourth Brigade, Colonel Richardson\n| ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n| Not engaged.

On July 24, Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] ascended in the balloon ''[[Enterprise (balloon)|Enterprise]]'' to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax. He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces, but was forced to land in Confederate territory. It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters. He reported that his observations \"restored confidence\" to the Union commanders.<ref>Haydon, pp. 192\u201393.</ref>\n\nThe Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated. Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined. On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service.<ref>Rawley, p. 58.</ref> On July 25, [[Pennsylvania Reserves|eleven thousand Pennsylvanians]] who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, for federal service in either Patterson's or McDowell's command arrived in Washington, D.C., and were finally accepted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Curtin|first=Andrew G.|title=Message of Andrew G.

The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs. Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run, the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell's army. Although the committee's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard, Patterson's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle, and he was no longer in the service. The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat, and McDowell bore the chief blame. On 25 July 1861, he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]], who would soon be named general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] [[Army of Virginia]] by Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] thirteen months later, at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]].<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\"/><ref>Eicher, pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\n===Effect on the Confederacy===\nThe reaction in the Confederacy was more muted. There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory, the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well.<ref>Detzer, pp. 492\u201393.</ref> Once the euphoria of victory had worn off, Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers.<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\"/>\n\nBeauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by President Davis to full [[General (CSA)|general]] in the Confederate army.<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, p. 79.</ref> Stonewall Jackson, arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory, received no special recognition, but would later achieve glory for his 1862 [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Privately, Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory.<ref name=\"bioArc\"/> Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow: \"Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt.

The decisive victory led to a degree of over-confidence on the part of Confederate forces, while prompting a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union. In hindsight commentators on both sides agreed that the one-sided outcome \"proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy\". Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation, [[James M. McPherson]] has argued that the ''esprit de corps'' attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory, together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders, also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months.<ref>{{cite book|author=James M.

The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms. The [[U.S. National Park Service]] uses the Confederate name for its [[Manassas National Battlefield Park|national battlefield park]], but the Union name (Bull Run) also has widespread currency in popular literature.<ref>McPherson, p. 346, n. 7. McPherson's popular one-volume history of the war uses the two names interchangeably because he states that \"neither name has any intrinsic superiority over the other.\"</ref>\n\n===Confusion between the battle flags===\nBattlefield confusion between the battle flags, especially the similarity of the Confederacy's \"Stars and Bars\" and the Union's \"Stars and Stripes\" when fluttering, led to the adoption of the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Battle flag|Confederate Battle Flag]], which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the [[Southern United States|South]] in general.<ref>McPherson, p. 342.</ref>\n\n===Conclusions===\nFirst Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle, and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict. The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men. One year later many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run, now combat veterans, would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Battle of Bull Run/Manassas]].<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\"/>\n\n==Additional battle maps==\n\n===Gallery: the First Bull Run hour by hour===\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map1.jpg|''Map 1'':<br />'''Situation Mid-July 1861'''\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map2.jpg|''Map 2'':<br />'''Beauregard's defensive situation'''<br />(Mid-July 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map3.jpg|''Map 3'':<br />'''Situation at 05:30\u201306:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map4.jpg|''Map 4'':<br />'''Situation at 10:30\u201311:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map5.jpg|''Map 5'':<br />'''Situation at 11:00\u201311:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map6.jpg|''Map 6'':<br />'''Situation at 12:00\u201312:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map7.jpg|''Map 7'':<br />'''Situation at 13:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map8.jpg|''Map 8'':<br />'''Situation at 14:30\u201315:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map9.jpg|''Map 9'':<br />'''Situation at 15:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map10.jpg|''Map 10'':<br />'''Situation at 15:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map11.jpg|''Map 11'':<br />'''Situation at 16:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map12.jpg|''Map 12'':<br />'''Situation at 16:30\u201317:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe First Battle of Bull Run is mentioned in the novel ''[[Gods and Generals (novel)|Gods and Generals]]'', but is depicted more fully in its [[Gods and Generals (film)|film adaptation]]. The battle forms the climax of the film ''[[Class of '61]]''.  It also appears in the first episode of the second season of the mini-series [[North and South (TV miniseries)|''North and South'']], in the second episode of the first season of the mini-series [[How the West Was Won (TV series)|''How the West Was Won'']] and in the first episode of the mini-series ''[[The Blue and the Gray (miniseries)|The Blue and the Gray]]''. ''Manassas'' (1999) is the first volume in the [[James Reasoner Civil War Series]] of historical novels. The battle is described in ''Rebel'' (1993), the first volume of [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s [[The Starbuck Chronicles]] series of historical novels. The battle is described from the viewpoint of a Union infantryman in [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novella ''Manassas'', which also depicts the political turmoil leading up to the Civil War. The battle is also depicted in [[John Jakes]]'s ''The Titans'', the fifth novel in [[The Kent Family Chronicles]], a series that explores the fictional Confederate cavalry officer Gideon Kent. The battle is the subject of the [[Johnny Horton]] song, \"Battle of Bull Run\". ''Shaman'', second in the Cole family trilogy by Noah Gordon, includes an account of the battle.  The battle is also depicted in the song \"Yankee Bayonet\" by indie-folk band [[The Decemberists]]. In ''[[Murder at 1600]]'', Detective Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes) has built a [[plan-relief]] of the battle which plays a certain role in the plot.\n\n==Sesquicentennial==\n[[File:Manassas, VA, Jubilee of Peace IMG 4353.JPG|thumb|The National Jubilee of Peace building at Grant and Lee avenues in [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], is draped with the U.S. flag for the 150th anniversary commemoration, held on July 21, 2011, of the First Battle of Bull Run.]]\nPrince William County staged special events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Civil War through 2011.

The battle was fought on July 21, 1861 in [[Prince William County, Virginia]], just north of the city of [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] and about 25 miles west-southwest of [[Washington, D.C.]] The [[Union Army|Union]]'s forces were slow in positioning themselves, allowing [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] reinforcements time to arrive by rail. Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle. It was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces.\n\nJust months after the start of the war at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], the  Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]], which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy. Yielding to political pressure, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] led his unseasoned Union Army across [[Bull Run (Occoquan River)|Bull Run]] against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage.\n\nConfederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]], stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\". The Confederates launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout. McDowell's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C.\n\nBoth armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties, and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated. The First Battle of Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war. Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was minimal, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively.

Earlier, South Carolina and seven other\nSouthern states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.\n \nTo suppress the Confederacy and restore Federal law in the Southern states, Lincoln called for [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 volunteers]] with ninety-day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000. He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three-year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to almost 20,000. Lincoln's actions caused four more Southern states, including Virginia, to secede and join the Confederacy, and by 1 June the Confederate capital had been moved from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond, Virginia.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., as thousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital, General in Chief Lt. Gen. [[Winfield Scott]] laid out his strategy to subdue the Confederate States. He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized and sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans. While the Army \"strangled\" the Confederacy in the west, the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts. The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott's \"[[Anaconda Plan]]\". Instead, many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond, only one hundred miles south of Washington, would quickly end the war.<ref>Ballard, 3.</ref>\nBy July 1861 thousands of volunteers were camped in and around Washington. Since General Scott was seventy-five years old and physically unable to lead this force, the administration searched for a more suitable field commander.<ref>Ballard, 4.</ref>\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott by Fredricks, 1862.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Lt.

It is sometimes called the \"[[Anaconda plan]]\".]]\n\n===Irvin McDowell===\nSecretary of the Treasury [[Salmon P. Chase]] championed fellow Ohioan, 42-year-old Maj. [[Irvin McDowell]]. Although McDowell was a [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate, his command experience was limited. In fact, he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General's Office. While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase, a former Ohio governor and senator. Now, through Chase's influence, McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command (by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia, which included the military forces in and around Washington ([[Army of the Potomac|Army of Northeastern Virginia]]).<ref>Ballard, p. 4.</ref> McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia, 35,000 men arranged in five divisions. Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations, McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops. Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments, but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level. He was reassured by President Lincoln, \"You are green, it is true, but they are green also; you are all green alike.\"<ref>Detzer, p. 77; Williams, p. 21; McPherson, p. 336; Davis, p. 110, attributes the remark to general-in-chief [[Winfield Scott]].</ref> Against his better judgment, McDowell commenced campaigning.\n\n===Intelligence===\nDuring the previous year, U.S. Army captain [[Thomas Jordan (general)|Thomas Jordan]] set up a pro-Southern spy network in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington City]], including [[Rose O'Neal Greenhow]], a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts.<ref name=\"fishel\">Fishel, Edwin C., ''The Secret War For The Union: The Untold Story of Military Intelligence in the Civil War'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1996, pp. 59\u201363</ref> He provided her with a code for messages.<ref name=\"bioArc\">[https://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/AdvancedSearchForm \"Greenhow, Rose O'Neal\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120211241/https://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/AdvancedSearchForm |date=January 20, 2016 }}, (1817\u20131864), ''The National Archives \u2013 People Description''. 1817\u20131864, (accessed February 5, 2013)</ref> After he left to join the Confederate Army, he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her.<ref name=\"fishel\"/> On July 9 and 16, 1861, Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General [[P.G.T.

He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the [[Rappahannock River]], the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital.<ref>Davis, pp. 110\u2013111.</ref> McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water, regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.<ref>Ballard, p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe [[Confederate Army of the Potomac]] (21,883 effectives)<ref name=Livermore>Livermore, p. 77.</ref> under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction, approximately 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) from the United States capital. McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army. Union [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Robert Patterson]]'s 18,000 men engaged Johnston's force (the [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] at 8,884 effectives, augmented by Maj. Gen. [[Theophilus H. Holmes]]'s [[brigade]] of 1,465<ref name=Livermore />) in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard.\n\n[[File:Battle of Bull Run.jpg|thumb|400px|Movements July 16\u201321, 1861]]\n[[File:First Bull Run July18.png|thumb|400px|Situation July 18]]\n[[File:ATLAS OR BATTLEFIELD MANASSAS.jpg|thumb|400px|Battlefield of Manassas]]\n\nAfter two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat, the Union army was allowed to rest in [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]]. McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. [[Theodore Runyon]] with 5,000 troops to protect the army's rear. In the meantime, McDowell searched for a way to [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] Beauregard, who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run. On July 18, the Union commander sent a [[division (military)|division]] under Brig. Gen. [[Daniel Tyler]] to pass on the Confederate right (southeast) flank. Tyler was drawn into a [[Battle of Blackburn's Ford|skirmish at Blackburn's Ford]] over Bull Run and made no headway. Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard's assistance if possible. Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon, while Stuart's cavalry screened the movement from Patterson. Patterson was completely deceived. One hour after Johnston's departure Patterson telegraphed Washington, \"I have succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief, in keeping General Johnston's force at Winchester.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 9.</ref>\n\nFor the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly. He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction. If the rumors were true, McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates, instead\nof 22,000. Another reason for quick action was McDowell's concern that the ninety-day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire. \"In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force\", he wrote Washington on the eve of battle. In fact, the next morning two units of McDowell's command, their enlistments expiring that day, would turn\na deaf ear to McDowell's appeal to stay a few days longer. Instead, to the sounds of battle, they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service.<ref>Ballard, p. 10.</ref>\n\nBecoming more frustrated, McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left (northwest) flank instead. He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. [[Daniel Tyler]]'s division at the [[Stone Bridge (Manassas)|Stone Bridge]] on the [[U.S. Route 29|Warrenton Turnpike]] and send the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[David Hunter]] and [[Samuel P. Heintzelman]] over Sudley Springs Ford. From here, these divisions could outflank the Confederate line and march into the Confederate rear. The brigade of [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Israel B. Richardson]] (Tyler's Division) would harass the enemy at Blackburn's Ford, preventing them from thwarting the main attack. Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area. Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan, it had a number of flaws: it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks, skills that had not been developed in the nascent army; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take; finally, McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston's Valley force, who had trained under [[Stonewall Jackson]], was able to board trains at [[Delaplane, Virginia|Piedmont Station]] and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard's men.<ref>Eicher, pp. 91\u2013100.</ref>\n\n===Prelude to battle===\nOn July 19\u201320, significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run. Johnston arrived with all of his army, except for the troops of Brig. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith|Kirby Smith]], who were still in transit. Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn's Ford, and Beauregard's plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville. Johnston, the senior officer, approved the plan. If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously, it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other's left flank.<ref>Eicher, p. 92.</ref>\n\nMcDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents, so he called for the balloon [[Enterprise (balloon)|''Enterprise'']], which was being demonstrated by Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] in Washington, to perform aerial reconnaissance.\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n{{further|First Bull Run Union order of battle|l1=Union order of battle}}\n{| style=\"float:right; clear:right;\"\n!bgcolor=\"#99ccff\"|Key Union Generals\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=4 class=center>\nFile:Portrait of Maj.

The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate, little more than a cart path in some places, and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9:30&nbsp;a.m. Tyler's men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m.<ref>Beatie, pp. 285\u201388; Esposito, text for Map 21; Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 312.</ref>\n\nAt 5:15&nbsp;a.m., Richardson's brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell's Ford on the Confederate right, some of which hit Beauregard's headquarters in the [[Wilmer McLean]] house as he was eating breakfast, alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted. Nevertheless, he ordered [[demonstration (military)|demonstration attacks]] north toward the Union left at Centreville. Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution. Although he intended for Brig. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] to lead the attack, Ewell, at Union Mills Ford, was simply ordered to \"hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment's notice\". Brig. Gen. [[David Rumph Jones|D.R. Jones]] was supposed to attack in support of Ewell, but found himself moving forward alone. Holmes was also supposed to support, but received no orders at all.<ref>Eicher, p. 94; Esposito, Map 22.</ref>\n\n[[File:Federal cavalry Sudley Springs.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. cavalry at [[Sudley Springs, Virginia|Sudley Spring Ford]]]]\n[[File:A Rebel Captain Forcing Negroes to Load Cannon Under the Fire of Beedan's Sharp-shooters (May 1862), by Harper's Weekly.png|thumb|right|An 1862 illustration of a Confederate officer forcing slaves to fire a cannon at U.S. forces at gunpoint.

[[Nathan George Evans|Nathan \"Shanks\" Evans]] and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men.<ref name=Rafuse312>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 312.</ref> Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. [[Robert C. Schenck]] were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain [[Edward Porter Alexander]], Beauregard's signal officer, observing from {{convert|8|mi|km}} southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of [[Wig-Wag Signaling|wig-wag semaphore signaling]] in combat, Alexander sent the message \"Look out for your left, your position is turned.\"<ref>Brown, pp. 43\u201345; Alexander, pp. 50\u201351. Alexander recalls that the signal was \"You are flanked.\"</ref> Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill, a low rise to the northwest of his previous position.<ref name=Rafuse312 />\n\nThe Confederate delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack launched by [[Major]] [[Roberdeau Wheat]]'s 1st Louisiana Special Battalion, \"[[Louisiana Tigers|Wheat's Tigers]]\". After Wheat's command was thrown back, and Wheat seriously wounded, Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. [[Barnard Elliott Bee, Jr.|Barnard Bee]] and Col. [[Francis S. Bartow]], bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men.<ref name=Rafuse312 /> They successfully slowed Hunter's lead brigade (Brig. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]) in its attempts to ford Bull Run and advance across Young's Branch, at the northern end of [[Henry House Hill]]. One of Tyler's brigade commanders, Col. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders. This surprise attack, coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj. [[George Sykes]], collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11:30&nbsp;a.m., sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", pp. 312\u201313; Rafuse, ''A Single Grand Victory\", p. 131; Esposito, Map 22; Eicher, pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\n(''Further map details, see:'' '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map4.jpg|Additional Map 4]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map5.jpg|Additional Map 5]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map6.jpg|Additional Map 6]]''' and '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map7.jpg|Additional Map 7]]'''.)\n\n===Noon phase===\n\n====Henry House Hill====\nAs they retreated from their Matthews Hill position, the remainder of Evans's, Bee's, and Bartow's commands received some cover from [[Captain (Confederate Army)|Capt.]] [[John D. Imboden]] and his battery of four 6-pounder guns, who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill. They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard, who had just arrived from Johnston's headquarters at the M. Lewis Farm, \"Portici\".<ref>Eicher, p. 95.</ref> Fortunately for the Confederates, McDowell did not press his advantage and attempt to seize the strategic ground immediately, choosing to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts. [[James B. Ricketts]] (Battery I, 1st U.S. Artillery) and [[Charles Griffin]] (Battery D, 5th U.S.) from Dogan's Ridge.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 313; Eicher, p. 96.</ref>\n\n[[File:First Bull Run July21 1400.png|thumb|400px|Attacks on Henry House Hill, noon\u20132 p.m]]\n[[File:First Bull Run July21 1600.png|thumb|400px|Union retreat, after 4 p.m.]]\nBrig. Gen [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]]'s [[Stonewall Brigade|Virginia Brigade]] came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon, accompanied by Col. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and his [[Hampton's Legion]], and Col. [[J.E.B. Stuart]]'s cavalry along with a contingent of 6-pounder guns. The Hampton Legion, some 600 men strong, managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman's advancing brigade. Hampton had purchased about 400 British Enfield rifles to equip the men with, however it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle. If so, they would have been the only foreign-made weapons on the field. The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton's musket fire and began to disintegrate. Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel, James Cameron, and remarked \"Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they won't follow him.\" Shortly afterwards, Cameron, the brother of US Senator [[Simon Cameron]], was fatally wounded. It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day, although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York.\n\nJackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill, where they were shielded from direct fire, and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line, which he posted on the crest of the hill; as the guns fired, their recoil moved them down the reverse slope, where they could be safely reloaded.<ref>Salmon, p. 19.</ref> Meanwhile, McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across {{convert|300|yd|m}} against Jackson's 13. Unlike many engagements in the Civil War, here the Confederate artillery had an advantage. The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges, with many shots fired over the head of their targets.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 314.</ref>\n\n[[File:HenryHouseBullRun1861.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of Judith Henry's house, \"Spring Hill\", after the battle]]\n\n[[File:Judith Henry farmhouse, Manassas, VA IMG 4319.JPG|right|thumb|Postwar house on site of Judith Henry house in Manassas]]\n\n[[File:Judith Henry grave, Mansasas, VA IMG 4318.JPG|right|thumb|Judith Henry grave]]\n\nOne of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry, an 85-year-old widow and invalid, who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House. As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire, he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building. A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow's feet and inflicted multiple injuries, from which she died later that day.<ref>Detzer, p. 357; Davis, pp. 204\u201305.</ref>\n\n\"The Enemy are driving us\", Bee exclaimed to Jackson. Jackson, a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], is said to have replied, \"Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet.\"<ref>Robertson, p. 264.</ref> Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, \"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians.\"<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, p. 82; Robertson, p. 264. McPherson, p. 342, reports the quotation after \"stone wall\" as being \"Rally around the Virginians!\"</ref> This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade's]]) nickname, \"Stonewall\". Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day, thus it is unclear exactly what he meant, moreover none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle. Col. [[States Rights Gist]], serving as Bee's aide-de-camp, took command of the brigade. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: \"Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!\"<ref>See, for instance, McPherson, p. 342. There are additional controversies about what Bee said and whether he said anything at all. See Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 733\u201334.</ref>\n\nArtillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line, hoping to provide [[enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire against the Confederates. At approximately 3 p.m., these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia, whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms, causing Griffin's commander, Maj. [[William Farquhar Barry|William F. Barry]], to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them. Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia followed by Stuart's cavalry attack against the flank of the [[11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] ([[Elmer E. Ellsworth|Ellsworth]]'s Fire [[Zouave]]s), which was supporting the battery, killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry. Capitalizing on this success, Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts's guns and they were captured as well. As additional Federal infantry engaged, the Confederates were pushed back and they reformed and the guns changed hands several times.<ref>Eicher, pp. 96\u201398; Esposito, Map 23; Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", pp. 314\u201315; McPherson, pp. 342\u201344.</ref>\n\n[[File:MNBPRickettsBatteryPainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Capture of Ricketts' Battery'', painting by Sidney E. King, National Park Service]]\nThe capture of the Union guns turned the tide of battle. Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill, outnumbering the Confederates two to one, no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously. Jackson continued to press his attacks, telling soldiers of the [[4th Virginia Infantry]], \"Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!\" For the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the [[Rebel yell]]. At about 4 p.m., the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. [[Philip St. George Cocke]]'s brigade.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", p. 315; Eicher, p. 98.</ref>\n\nTo the west, Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. [[Oliver Otis Howard]]'s brigade from Heintzelman's division. But at 4 p.m., two Confederate brigades-Col. [[Jubal Early]]'s, which had moved from the Confederate right, and  Brig. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]'s (commanded by Col. [[Arnold Elzey]] after Smith was wounded), which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valley, moved forward and crushed Howard's brigade. Beauregard ordered his entire line forward, and the Union troops began to panic in retreat. At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell's army was disintegrating. Thousands, in large and small groups or as individuals, began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville in a rout. McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers, but most had had enough. Unable to stop the mass exodus, McDowell gave orders for Porter's [[Regular army|regular]] infantry battalion, near the intersection of the turnpike and\nManassas-Sudley Road, to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew. The unit briefly held the crossroads, then retreated eastward with the rest of the army.<ref>Ballard, p. 32.</ref> McDowell's force crumbled and began to retreat.<ref>Rafuse, \"First Battle of Bull Run\", pp. 315\u201316.</ref>\n\n(''Further map details, see:'' '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map8.jpg|Additional Map 8]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map9.jpg|Additional Map 9]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map10.jpg|Additional Map 10]]''', '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map11.jpg|Additional Map 11]]''' and '''[[:File:First Battle of Bull Run Map12.jpg|Additional Map 12]]'''.)\n\n===Union retreat===\nThe retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings, but it was poorly managed by the Union officers. A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell's force. As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville, discarding their arms and equipment, McDowell ordered Col. [[Dixon S. Miles]]'s division to act as a rear guard, but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington. In the disorder that followed, hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner. Wagons and artillery were abandoned, including the 30-pounder Parrott rifle, which had opened the battle with such fanfare. Expecting an easy Union victory, the wealthy elite of nearby Washington, including congressmen and their families, had come to picnic and watch the battle. When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder, the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages.<ref>McPherson, p. 344; Eicher, p. 98; Esposito, Map 24.</ref>  The pell-mell retreat became known in the Southern press as \u201cThe Great Skedaddle.\u201d<ref>https://historicaldigression.com/2011/07/28/bull-run-and-the-art-of-the-skedaddle/; retrieved Jan. 31, 2019</ref><ref>http://www.thehistoryreader.com/modern-history/july-21-1861-first-major-battle-civil-war/; retrieved Jan. 31, 2019</ref>\n\nSince their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well, Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage, despite urging from [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating. An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank, using the brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Milledge L. Bonham]] and [[James Longstreet]], was a failure. The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham's men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard, and found that Richardson's brigade blocked the road to Centreville, he called off the pursuit.<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, p. 76; Esposito, Map 24; Davis, p. 149.</ref>\n\nIn Washington President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory. Instead, a telegram arrived stating \"General McDowell's army in full retreat through Centreville. The day is lost. Save Washington and the remnants of this army.\" The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital. From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond, \"We have won a glorious but dear-bought victory. Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Brief observations===\nFirst Bull Run was a clash between relatively large, ill-trained bodies of recruits, led by inexperienced officers. Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle, only 18,000 had actually been engaged. Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield, he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades, instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole. Other factors contributed to McDowell's defeat: Patterson's failure to hold Johnston in the valley; McDowell's two-day delay at Centreville; allowing Tyler's division to lead the march on 21 July thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman; and the 2 1/2-hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews' Hill, which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill. On Henry Hill Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level, generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves. Johnston's decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory. Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time, almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle. After reaching Manassas Junction, Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard, but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive.<ref>Ballard, pp. 35\u201336.</ref> Jackson and Bee's brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle; Jackson's brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50% casualties.\n\n===Detailed casualties===\nBull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up to that point. Union casualties were 460 killed, 1,124 wounded, and 1,312 missing or captured; Confederate casualties were 387 killed, 1,582 wounded, and 13 missing.<ref name=\"Eicher, p. 99\">Eicher, p. 99.</ref> Among the Union dead was Col. [[James Cameron (Union colonel)|James Cameron]], brother of President Lincoln's first [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[Simon Cameron]].<ref>Detzer, pp. 434\u2013435.</ref> Among the Confederate casualties was Col. [[Francis S. Bartow]], who was the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War. General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day.<ref>Detzer, p. 383.</ref>\nCompared to later battles, casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy. Both Union and Confederate killed, wounded, and missing were a little over one thousand seven hundred each.<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\">Ballard, p. 36.</ref> Two Confederate brigade commanders, Jackson and Edmund Kirby-Smith, were wounded in the battle. Jackson was shot in the hand, so he remained on the battlefield. No Union officers above the regimental level were killed; two division commanders (Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter), and one brigade commander (Orlando Willcox) were wounded.\n\n====Union====\n''Union casualties at the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.''<ref name=UFC/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ <u>ARMY OF NORTHEASTERN VIRGINIA</u>\n|-\n|-\n! scope=col rowspan=2 | Troops\n! scope=col colspan=2 | Killed\n! scope=col colspan=2 | Wounded\n! scope=col colspan=2 | Missing\n! scope=col rowspan=2 | Remarks\n|-\n! scope=col | Officers\n! scope=col | Enlisted Men\n! scope=col | Officers\n! scope=col | Enlisted Men\n! scope=col | Officers\n! scope=col | Enlisted Men\n|-\n! scope=row | General staff\n| 1 ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|\n|-\n! scope=row | First Division, General TYLER:\n| colspan=6 |\n|\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | First Brigade, Colonel Keyes\n| || 19 || 4 || 46 || 5 || 149\n| Eighteen others slightly wounded.\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | Second Brigade, General Schenck\n| 3 || 16 ||  || 15 || 1 || 15\n|\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | Third Brigade, Colonel Sherman\n| 3 || 117 || 15 || 193 || 13 || 240\n|\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"padding-left:1em\" | Fourth Brigade, Colonel Richardson\n| ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n| Not engaged.

An iron resolve entered the Northern soul ...\n|source= \u2014  James A. Rawley, ''Turning Points of the Civil War''<ref>Rawley, pp. 56\u201357.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Effect on the Union and subsequent events===\nUnion forces and civilians alike feared that Confederate forces would advance on Washington, D.C., with very little standing in their way. On July 24, Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] ascended in the balloon ''[[Enterprise (balloon)|Enterprise]]'' to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax. He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces, but was forced to land in Confederate territory. It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters. He reported that his observations \"restored confidence\" to the Union commanders.<ref>Haydon, pp. 192\u201393.</ref>\n\nThe Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated. Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined. On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service.<ref>Rawley, p. 58.</ref> On July 25, [[Pennsylvania Reserves|eleven thousand Pennsylvanians]] who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, for federal service in either Patterson's or McDowell's command arrived in Washington, D.C., and were finally accepted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Curtin|first=Andrew G.|title=Message of Andrew G. Curtin, Governor of Pennsylvania, to the Legislature,|journal=Executive Department|date=January 8, 1862|pages=8|url=https://archive.org/details/messageofandrewg00penn}}</ref>\n\nThree months after First Bull Run Union forces suffered another, smaller defeat at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]], near Leesburg, Virginia. The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs. Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run, the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell's army. Although the committee's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard, Patterson's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle, and he was no longer in the service. The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat, and McDowell bore the chief blame. On 25 July 1861, he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]], who would soon be named general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] [[Army of Virginia]] by Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] thirteen months later, at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]].<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\"/><ref>Eicher, pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\n===Effect on the Confederacy===\nThe reaction in the Confederacy was more muted. There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory, the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well.<ref>Detzer, pp. 492\u201393.</ref> Once the euphoria of victory had worn off, Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers.<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\"/>\n\nBeauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by President Davis to full [[General (CSA)|general]] in the Confederate army.<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, p. 79.</ref> Stonewall Jackson, arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory, received no special recognition, but would later achieve glory for his 1862 [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Privately, Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory.<ref name=\"bioArc\"/> Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow: \"Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt. (Signed) [[Thomas Jordan (general)|JORDAN]], Adjutant-General.\"<ref name=\"memoir\">Greenhow, Rose O'Neal, [http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/greenhow/menu.html ''My Imprisonment and the First Year of Abolition Rule at Washington''], London: Richard Bentley, 1863, p. 18, full text online at ''Documenting the American South'', University of North Carolina</ref>\n\nThe battle also had long-term psychological consequences. The decisive victory led to a degree of over-confidence on the part of Confederate forces, while prompting a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union. In hindsight commentators on both sides agreed that the one-sided outcome \"proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy\". Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation, [[James M. McPherson]] has argued that the ''esprit de corps'' attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory, together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders, also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months.<ref>{{cite book|author=James M. McPherson|title=The Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&pg=PA347|pages=347\u2013350|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|isbn=9780199743902}}</ref>\n\n===Confederate victory: turning point of the American Civil War===\n{{further|Turning point of the American Civil War#Confederate victory at Bull Run (July 1861)}}\n\n===\"''Bull Run''\" vs. \"''Manassas''\"===\nThe name of the battle has caused controversy since 1861. The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms. The [[U.S. National Park Service]] uses the Confederate name for its [[Manassas National Battlefield Park|national battlefield park]], but the Union name (Bull Run) also has widespread currency in popular literature.<ref>McPherson, p. 346, n. 7. McPherson's popular one-volume history of the war uses the two names interchangeably because he states that \"neither name has any intrinsic superiority over the other.\"</ref>\n\n===Confusion between the battle flags===\nBattlefield confusion between the battle flags, especially the similarity of the Confederacy's \"Stars and Bars\" and the Union's \"Stars and Stripes\" when fluttering, led to the adoption of the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Battle flag|Confederate Battle Flag]], which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the [[Southern United States|South]] in general.<ref>McPherson, p. 342.</ref>\n\n===Conclusions===\nFirst Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle, and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict. The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men. One year later many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run, now combat veterans, would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Battle of Bull Run/Manassas]].<ref name=\"Ballard, page 36\"/>\n\n==Additional battle maps==\n\n===Gallery: the First Bull Run hour by hour===\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map1.jpg|''Map 1'':<br />'''Situation Mid-July 1861'''\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map2.jpg|''Map 2'':<br />'''Beauregard's defensive situation'''<br />(Mid-July 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map3.jpg|''Map 3'':<br />'''Situation at 05:30\u201306:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map4.jpg|''Map 4'':<br />'''Situation at 10:30\u201311:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map5.jpg|''Map 5'':<br />'''Situation at 11:00\u201311:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map6.jpg|''Map 6'':<br />'''Situation at 12:00\u201312:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map7.jpg|''Map 7'':<br />'''Situation at 13:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map8.jpg|''Map 8'':<br />'''Situation at 14:30\u201315:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map9.jpg|''Map 9'':<br />'''Situation at 15:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map10.jpg|''Map 10'':<br />'''Situation at 15:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map11.jpg|''Map 11'':<br />'''Situation at 16:00'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\nFile:First Battle of Bull Run Map12.jpg|''Map 12'':<br />'''Situation at 16:30\u201317:30'''<br />(July 21, 1861)\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe First Battle of Bull Run is mentioned in the novel ''[[Gods and Generals (novel)|Gods and Generals]]'', but is depicted more fully in its [[Gods and Generals (film)|film adaptation]]. The battle forms the climax of the film ''[[Class of '61]]''.  It also appears in the first episode of the second season of the mini-series [[North and South (TV miniseries)|''North and South'']], in the second episode of the first season of the mini-series [[How the West Was Won (TV series)|''How the West Was Won'']] and in the first episode of the mini-series ''[[The Blue and the Gray (miniseries)|The Blue and the Gray]]''. ''Manassas'' (1999) is the first volume in the [[James Reasoner Civil War Series]] of historical novels. The battle is described in ''Rebel'' (1993), the first volume of [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s [[The Starbuck Chronicles]] series of historical novels. The battle is described from the viewpoint of a Union infantryman in [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novella ''Manassas'', which also depicts the political turmoil leading up to the Civil War. The battle is also depicted in [[John Jakes]]'s ''The Titans'', the fifth novel in [[The Kent Family Chronicles]], a series that explores the fictional Confederate cavalry officer Gideon Kent. The battle is the subject of the [[Johnny Horton]] song, \"Battle of Bull Run\". ''Shaman'', second in the Cole family trilogy by Noah Gordon, includes an account of the battle.  The battle is also depicted in the song \"Yankee Bayonet\" by indie-folk band [[The Decemberists]]. In ''[[Murder at 1600]]'', Detective Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes) has built a [[plan-relief]] of the battle which plays a certain role in the plot.\n\n==Sesquicentennial==\n[[File:Manassas, VA, Jubilee of Peace IMG 4353.JPG|thumb|The National Jubilee of Peace building at Grant and Lee avenues in [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], is draped with the U.S. flag for the 150th anniversary commemoration, held on July 21, 2011, of the First Battle of Bull Run.]]\nPrince William County staged special events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Civil War through 2011.

The dark color of the water is caused by a layer of phototropic microorganisms concentrated in a dense, purple colored layer at {{convert|15|to|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} depth; this layer \"swallows\" the light.

The name originates from the deep blue color of water in these sinkholes, which is created by the high clarity of the water and the great depth of the sinkholes; only the deep blue color of the visible [[spectrum]] can penetrate such depth and return after reflection.\n* '''[[Cenote]]s''' \u2013 This refers to the characteristic water-filled sinkholes in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], [[Belize]] and some other regions. Many cenotes have formed in limestone deposited in shallow seas created by the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] meteorite's impact.\n* '''S\u00f3tanos''' \u2013 This name is given to several giant pits in several states of Mexico.\n* '''Tiankengs''' \u2013 These are extremely large sinkholes, typically deeper and wider than {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with mostly vertical walls, most often created by the collapse of caverns.
