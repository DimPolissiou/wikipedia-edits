He first became an elected member of Nauru's 18-seat parliament in 1973. Particularly in his earlier years in the [[Parliament of Nauru]] Dowiyogo was seen as an opponent of [[Nauru]]'s first post-independence President, [[Hammer DeRoburt]]. Dowiyogo founded the Nauru Institute of Media and Communications which operated between 1984 and 1996 but due to financial difficulties was closed in 1997.\n\n==President of Nauru==\nHe served his first term as President from 1976 to 1978 after ousting [[Hammer DeRoburt]]. Over the next 25 years, Dowiyogo served as President several times, for periods as long as six years (1989&ndash;1995) and as short as 8 days (in January 2003). He was the youngest president in Nauru. During the 1980s, he sharply criticized [[France]] and the United States for [[atomic weapon]]s testing in Nauru.\n\nIn 1990, Dowiyogo was awarded the [[New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Alister |last2=Coddington |first2=Deborah |authorlink1=Alister Taylor |authorlink2=Deborah Coddington |title=Honoured by the Queen \u2013 New Zealand |year=1994 |publisher=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa |location=Auckland |isbn=0-908578-34-2 |page=125}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nHe died in office in March 2003 (having been president on this occasion since January 2003) at [[George Washington University Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from heart complications brought on by his struggle with [[diabetes]], a common ailment on Nauru. At the time of the deterioration of his final illness, he had been engaged in protracted negotiations with the [[United States]] Government.\n\n==Family==\nDowiyogo had eight children with his wife,

politician who served as [[President of Nauru]] on seven separate occasions. During this time, he also served as a [[Parliament of Nauru|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Ubenide Constituency|constituency of Ubenide]].\n\n==Background and early career==\nDowiyogo was born in Nauru on 14 February 1946. He first became an elected member of Nauru's 18-seat parliament in 1973. Particularly in his earlier years in the [[Parliament of Nauru]] Dowiyogo was seen as an opponent of [[Nauru]]'s first post-independence President, [[Hammer DeRoburt]]. Dowiyogo founded the Nauru Institute of Media and Communications which operated between 1984 and 1996 but due to financial difficulties was closed in 1997.\n\n==President of Nauru==\nHe served his first term as President from 1976 to 1978 after ousting [[Hammer DeRoburt]]. Over the next 25 years, Dowiyogo served as President several times, for periods as long as six years (1989&ndash;1995) and as short as 8 days (in January 2003). He was the youngest president in Nauru. During the 1980s, he sharply criticized [[France]] and the United States for [[atomic weapon]]s testing in Nauru. \n\nIn 1990, Dowiyogo was awarded the [[New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Alister |last2=Coddington |first2=Deborah |authorlink1=Alister Taylor |authorlink2=Deborah Coddington |title=Honoured by the Queen \u2013 New Zealand |year=1994 |publisher=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa |location=Auckland |isbn=0-908578-34-2 |page=125}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nHe died in office in March 2003 (having been president on this occasion since January 2003) at [[George Washington University Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from heart complications brought on by his struggle with [[diabetes]], a common ailment on Nauru. At the time of the deterioration of his final illness, he had been engaged in protracted negotiations with the [[United States]] Government.\n\n==Family==\nDowiyogo had eight children with his wife, [[Christina Dowiyogo]] (died March 2008): \nClara Augusta Alefaio (n\u00e9e Dowiyogo) who served at the Nauru education Department but now resides in New Zealand\n[[Valdon Dowiyogo|Valdon Kape Dowiyogo]], who served as Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, \nJesaulenko Dowiyogo, who served as diplomat and later Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Nauru Fisheries and Marine Resources Authority, \nJunior Dowiyogo who served as Commissioner for Police in the Nauru Police Force \nPeter Jason Dowiyogo who worked at the Nauru Post Office, David Dowiyogo who is employed at the Republic of Nauru Hospital \nJeff Dowiyogo who currently resides in Australia \nZita Dowiyogo who now Serves at the Nauru Immigration Office.<ref name=abc>{{cite news |first=|last=|title=New speaker for Nauru parliament|url=http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/200803/s2195476.htm|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher=|date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2009-04-05}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Hammer DeRoburt]]<br>[[Kenos Aroi]]<br>[[Lagumot Harris]]<br>[[Kinza Clodumar]]<br>[[Ren\u00e9 Harris]]<br>[[Ren\u00e9 Harris]]<br>[[Ren\u00e9 Harris]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[President of Nauru]] | years=22 December 1976 \u2013 19 April 1978<br>12 December 1989 \u2013 22 November 1995<br>11 November 1996 \u2013 26 November 1996<br>18 June 1998 \u2013 27 April 1999<br>20 April 2000 \u2013 30 March 2001<br>9 January 2003 \u2013 17 January 2003<br>18 January 2003 \u2013 10 March 2003}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Lagumot Harris]]<br>[[Lagumot Harris]]<br>[[Kennan Adeang]]<br>[[Ren\u00e9 Harris]]<br>[[Ren\u00e9 Harris]]<br>[[Ren\u00e9 Harris]]<br>[[Derog Gioura]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{NauruPres}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dowiyogo, Bernard}}\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n[[Category:Deaths from diabetes]]\n[[Category:Democratic Party of Nauru politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Nauru]]\n[[Category:Nauruan politicians of Japanese descent]]\n[[Category:Nauruan people of i-Kiribati descent]]\n[[Category:Nauruan politicians]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Nauru]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Dowiyogo"}
