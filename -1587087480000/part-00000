The islands are part of the [[island arc]] that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Cross section of mariana trench.svg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|The Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Mariana Plate, creating the Mariana trench, and (further on) the arc of the Mariana Islands, as water trapped in the plate is released and explodes upward to form island volcanoes and earthquakes .]]\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc|Izu-Bonin-Mariana]] [[subduction]] system that forms the [[convergent boundary|boundary]] between two [[tectonic plate]]s. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the [[Pacific Plate]], is [[subduction|subducted]] (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller [[Mariana Plate]] that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is, therefore, cooler and denser; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate.

The islands are part of the [[island arc]] that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Cross section of mariana trench.svg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|The Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Mariana Plate, creating the Mariana trench, and (further on) the arc of the Mariana Islands, as water trapped in the plate is released and explodes upward to form island volcanoes and earthquakes .]]\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc|Izu-Bonin-Mariana]] [[subduction]] system that forms the [[convergent boundary|boundary]] between two [[tectonic plate]]s. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the [[Pacific Plate]], is [[subduction|subducted]] (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller [[Mariana Plate]] that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is, therefore, cooler and denser; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.\n\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the [[Mariana Islands]]. These volcanic islands are caused by [[flux melting]] of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] due to the release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.\n\n==Research history==\n[[File:Map00148 (28286522445).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Ocean trenches in the western Pacific]]\n{{See also|Challenger Deep}}\nThe trench was first [[Depth sounding|sounded]] during the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of {{convert|4475|fathom|m ft|abbr=off|lk=in}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |title=About the Mariana Trench \u2013 DEEPSEA CHALLENGE Expedition |publisher=Deepseachallenge.com |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628083954/http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |archivedate=28 June 2013  }}</ref> In 1877, a map was published called ''Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans'' (\"Depth map of the Great Ocean\") by Petermann, which showed a ''Challenger Tief'' (\"Challenger deep\") at the location of that sounding.

As a driver, he was a five-time [[Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Champion]] and a three-time winner of the [[Bathurst 1000]]. As of 2008 Johnson has claimed over twenty awards and honours,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} including the [[V8 Supercars Hall of Fame]] into which he was inducted in 2001.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Dick Johnson was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for his role as a \"sports legend\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{BLP unsourced section |date= July 2018}}\nAs a teen Johnson attended [[Cavendish Road State High School]] in Brisbane, Australia and it was in this area of [[Coorparoo]] that he first started driving with his father as a young child. Cavendish Road State High School has named one of their school houses Johnson, in his honour. The house colour is blue.\n\nAfter leaving school, Johnson was drafted into the [[Australian Army]] at the age of 20 and began his two-year National Service in 1965. Although they did not know each other at the time, both Johnson and future touring car rival [[Peter Brock]] were stationed together at the [[Blamey Barracks]] near [[Wagga Wagga]] in [[New South Wales]] from 1965-1967.\n\n==Racing==\n\n[[File:D-Johnson-EH-Graham-Ruckert.jpg|thumb|left|Dick Johnson in the Holden EH at Lakeside in November 1969]]Despite becoming synonymous with driving [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]], Johnson raced in his early days in a succession of [[Holden]]s. Johnson's first race car was a [[Holden FJ]], his first race being at [[Lakeside International Raceway]] in November 1964 in 1968 and 1969 he raced his [[Holden EH]] and from there progressed to a [[Holden Torana]] GTR for 1970, scoring his first [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] points at [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] in that year. The GTR was upgraded to XU-1 specifications in 1971. Johnson's first drive in the [[Hardie Ferodo 1000]] was in Bob Forbes' [[Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1]] in [[1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1973]] when they placed fifth. Johnson then had a single race for the [[Holden Dealer Team]] at the [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]] round of the [[1974 Australian Touring Car Championship|1974 ATCC]] where he finished 3rd driving a GTR XU-1. He later purchased the ex HDT Torana in which Peter Brock had won the Bathurst 1000 in 1972 from Barrie Nixon Smith and campaigned the car until his switch to Ford in 1977.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\"/> The Torana was sold to Kerry Cox who raced it in the QLD Touring car championship in a close rivalry with Dick, with Cox winning in 1977 and Dick getting the title in 1978.\n\n[[File:Johnson-xd81.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Tru-Blu Ford Falcon]]In 1980, during the [[Bathurst 1000]] he started 2nd and led for the first 17 laps before his car was spun off the track after hitting a football sized rock that had been, according to an eye-witness in 2012, accidentally kicked onto the track by one of a pair of inebriated men.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyewitness reveals how a rock changed Dick Johnson\u2019s life|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2012/10/19/eyewitness-reveals-how-the-rock-changed-dick-johnsons-life/|accessdate=6 October 2017|publisher=Speedcafe.com|date=19 October 2012}}</ref> The resulting public support where people from around Australia rang their local [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] television station (the race broadcaster) and pledged money to help the team get back on its feet. Eventually the sum of [[Australian dollar|A$]]72,000 was donated to help rebuild the car. Led by its CEO [[Edsel Ford II]] who saw the value of the goodwill in the press surrounding Johnson's crash, the [[Ford Motor Company of Australia]] provided a new car shell and promised to match the donation dollar for dollar, resulting in the team receiving $144,000 to help get back into racing.\n\nJohnson's close friend Ross Palmer, the owner of Palmer Tube Mills of Brisbane, became his primary sponsor in 1981 (with Bryan Byrt Ford also still a major sponsor), and with the donated money allowed him to return the next year to win both the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) and the Bathurst 1000 (with [[John French (racing driver)|John French]]). Johnson won the ATCC in a famous race-long duel with [[Peter Brock]] at the [[Lakeside International Raceway]] [[Lakeside ATCC round|round]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fogarty |first1=Mark |title=High-flying Falcons: The magic moments in almost 50 years of racing |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/highflying-falcons-the-magic-moments-in-almost-50-years-of-racing-20161006-grw2ri.html |accessdate=19 February 2019 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 October 2016 |language=en}}</ref> He won the ATCC again in 1982 (the Tru Blu [[Ford XD Falcon|XD Falcon]]), 1984 (Greens Tuff [[Ford XE Falcon|XE Falcon]]), 1988 ([[Ford Sierra RS500]]) and 1989 (Sierra RS500). He also won Bathurst in 1989 (in a Ford Sierra with [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]) and 1994 (in an EB Falcon, also with Bowe). The names Tru Blu, and Greens Tuff, as well as Red Roo (seen in late 1982 only) were product names of Palmer Tube Mills.\n\nWith much larger budgets required in the racing industry, Ross Palmer helped negotiate for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] to be the team's primary sponsor from [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987]]. The larger budget allowed the team to expand from just one car for Dick, to a second [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] for his then team mate [[Gregg Hansford]].\n\n==NASCAR==\nIn 1989 and 1990, prompted by Palmer Tube Mills who assisted him in receiving multiple sources of sponsorship and through the company's American offshoot Redkote, Johnson made a brief foray into the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] driving a [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], entering a total of seven races with a best start of 11th at [[Sears Point Raceway]] in his first race, and a best finish of 22nd at [[Pocono Raceway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |title=Dick Johnson |publisher=[[NASCAR]] |accessdate=15 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504223535/http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |archivedate=4 May 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref> Johnson also drove a Thunderbird in the first NASCAR race held in Australia, the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500]] at the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]]. Unfortunately for Johnson he was involved in an early race crash which put him out of the event.\n\n==Retirement==\nDick Johnson retired from racing at the end of the 1999 season, though he remains in charge of DJR. He did however make a one off final appearance in front of his home crowd at the Queensland 500 in 2000 with his son [[Steven Johnson (motor racing)|Steven]] who had taken over driving Dick's famous Number 17 and continued to for over a decade after.<ref name=\"out of seat\">{{cite web| title=Steven Johnson Out of Driver's Seat at DJR| url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/02/24/steven-johnson-out-of-drivers-seat-at-djr/| publisher=speedcafe.com| accessdate=22 July 2013| date=24 February 2013}}</ref> Johnson has twice written his autobiography as well as contributing to a third biography.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\">{{cite book| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Don't Tell Me I Can't Do That| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Don_t_Tell_Me_I_Can_t_Do_That.html?id=LCpAAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y| publisher=Pan Macmillan| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=243 pages| year=2000| isbn=9780732910464}}</ref><ref name=autobiography>{{cite web| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Dick Johnson: The autobiography of a true-blue Aussie sporting legend| url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| publisher=Random House| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=432 pages| year=2013| isbn=9781742759777| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725004007/http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| archivedate=25 July 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Unforgiving Minute\">{{cite book| last=Tuckey| first=Bill| title=The Unforgiving Minute.

Johnson and co-driver John French were also wired for sound so the commentary team could talk to the drivers while racing around the track. From then on Johnson's cars were rarely without a TV camera sitting where the passenger seat usually was, especially when Seven was televising the race. His laconic commentary and seemingly endless list of one-liners quickly became a favourite with Australian race fans, even those who normally followed Holden drivers such as Peter Brock and Allan Grice, both of whom also became exponents of using racecam.\n\nSome of Johnson's quotes while on racecam were:\n* \"I've got one black [[BMW E24|BMW]] in front of me, one behind me. [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] and his [[All Blacks]]\" \u2013 [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985 ATCC]], Round 5 at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] while he was sandwiched between the black [[JPS Team BMW]]'s of [[New Zealander]]s [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Neville Crichton]]. Gardner was the JPS team manager.\n* \"The old [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo]] must have its truck suspension in\" \u2013 [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship|1986 ATCC]], Round 4 at Adelaide International. Ironically [[Robbie Francevic]]'s Volvo emerged as the race winner.\n* \"This race is like the Irishman who won the [[Tour de France]] I tell ya. He had to go on a lap of honour\" \u2013 [[1986 James Hardie 1000]]\n* \"This is where I lose so much time. I mean, this part of the track is just so boring\" \u2013 1986 Bathurst referring to his [[Ford Windsor engine|V8]] [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang's]] lack of grunt compared to his competitors on the run up [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mountain Straight]].\n* \"It's missing and carrying on like an old sheila\" \u2013 [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 ATCC]], Grand Finale at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after turbo boost problems with his championship winning [[Ford Sierra RS500]] saw him relinquish the lead mid-race to team mate [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]. With the opposition nowhere in sight, Bowe later slowed enough to allow Dick to win the race and followed him across the line in a 1\u20132 form finish.\n* \"Winton? Its like running a marathon around your clothesline\" \u2013 [[1990 Australian Touring Car Championship|1990 ATCC]], Round 4 at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]] after [[ATN|Channel 7]] commentator Mike Raymond asked him what the definition of Winton was.\n* \"Then [[Peter Brock|Brock]] got past me would you believe, unfortunately, and that thing of his like, I nearly choked to death on [[Mobil|Mobil 1]]. It looks like the last train to Ferny Grove\" \u2013 1990 ATCC, Grand Finale at Oran Park after problems with the Sierra saw him drop out of race winning and championship contention. He was referring to the Peter Brock Sierra's habit of belching black oil smoke out of its exhaust whenever he lifted off the accelerator.\n* \"The Sierra on one cylinder has got as much grunt as the [[Holden Commodore SS Group A#VN SS Group A SV|Commodore]]\" \u2013 [[1991 Australian Touring Car Championship|1991 ATCC]], Round 5 at Winton after his misfiring Sierra had been passed by the [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] Holden Commodore of [[Larry Perkins]].\n* \"You've got to be joking\" \u2013 [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995 ATCC]], [[Mount Panorama ATCC sprint round|Round 3]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]]. Channel 7 had just crossed to Johnson with Mike Raymond asking \"Are you lonely?\". Johnson's quote came immediately after as he spun his [[Ford EF Falcon]] into Caltex Chase, seemingly distracted by Raymond's interruption. However, as the TV camera's soon picked up, the rear wing of the Falcon had collapsed at over {{Convert|280|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} as he was turning into the fastest corner on any Australian race circuit, at the same moment that Seven crossed to talk to him.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ds4PU_PweU Dick Johnson rear wing snap \u2013 1995 ATCC Bathurst]</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

driver]].  As a driver, he was a five-time [[Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Champion]] and a three-time winner of the [[Bathurst 1000]]. As of 2008 Johnson has claimed over twenty awards and honours,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} including the [[V8 Supercars Hall of Fame]] into which he was inducted in 2001.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Dick Johnson was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for his role as a \"sports legend\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{BLP unsourced section |date= July 2018}}\nAs a teen Johnson attended [[Cavendish Road State High School]] in Brisbane, Australia and it was in this area of [[Coorparoo]] that he first started driving with his father as a young child. Cavendish Road State High School has named one of their school houses Johnson, in his honour. The house colour is blue.\n\nAfter leaving school, Johnson was drafted into the [[Australian Army]] at the age of 20 and began his two-year National Service in 1965. Although they did not know each other at the time, both Johnson and future touring car rival [[Peter Brock]] were stationed together at the [[Blamey Barracks]] near [[Wagga Wagga]] in [[New South Wales]] from 1965-1967.\n\n==Racing==\n\n[[File:D-Johnson-EH-Graham-Ruckert.jpg|thumb|left|Dick Johnson in the Holden EH at Lakeside in November 1969]]Despite becoming synonymous with driving [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]], Johnson raced in his early days in a succession of [[Holden]]s. Johnson's first race car was a [[Holden FJ]], his first race being at [[Lakeside International Raceway]] in November 1964 in 1968 and 1969 he raced his [[Holden EH]] and from there progressed to a [[Holden Torana]] GTR for 1970, scoring his first [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] points at [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] in that year. The GTR was upgraded to XU-1 specifications in 1971. Johnson's first drive in the [[Hardie Ferodo 1000]] was in Bob Forbes' [[Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1]] in [[1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1973]] when they placed fifth. Johnson then had a single race for the [[Holden Dealer Team]] at the [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]] round of the [[1974 Australian Touring Car Championship|1974 ATCC]] where he finished 3rd driving a GTR XU-1. He later purchased the ex HDT Torana in which Peter Brock had won the Bathurst 1000 in 1972 from Barrie Nixon Smith and campaigned the car until his switch to Ford in 1977.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\"/> The Torana was sold to Kerry Cox who raced it in the QLD Touring car championship in a close rivalry with Dick, with Cox winning in 1977 and Dick getting the title in 1978.\n\n[[File:Johnson-xd81.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Tru-Blu Ford Falcon]]In 1980, during the [[Bathurst 1000]] he started 2nd and led for the first 17 laps before his car was spun off the track after hitting a football sized rock that had been, according to an eye-witness in 2012, accidentally kicked onto the track by one of a pair of inebriated men.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyewitness reveals how a rock changed Dick Johnson\u2019s life|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2012/10/19/eyewitness-reveals-how-the-rock-changed-dick-johnsons-life/|accessdate=6 October 2017|publisher=Speedcafe.com|date=19 October 2012}}</ref> The resulting public support where people from around Australia rang their local [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] television station (the race broadcaster) and pledged money to help the team get back on its feet. Eventually the sum of [[Australian dollar|A$]]72,000 was donated to help rebuild the car. Led by its CEO [[Edsel Ford II]] who saw the value of the goodwill in the press surrounding Johnson's crash, the [[Ford Motor Company of Australia]] provided a new car shell and promised to match the donation dollar for dollar, resulting in the team receiving $144,000 to help get back into racing.\n\nJohnson's close friend Ross Palmer, the owner of Palmer Tube Mills of Brisbane, became his primary sponsor in 1981 (with Bryan Byrt Ford also still a major sponsor), and with the donated money allowed him to return the next year to win both the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) and the Bathurst 1000 (with [[John French (racing driver)|John French]]). Johnson won the ATCC in a famous race-long duel with [[Peter Brock]] at the [[Lakeside International Raceway]] [[Lakeside ATCC round|round]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fogarty |first1=Mark |title=High-flying Falcons: The magic moments in almost 50 years of racing |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/highflying-falcons-the-magic-moments-in-almost-50-years-of-racing-20161006-grw2ri.html |accessdate=19 February 2019 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 October 2016 |language=en}}</ref> He won the ATCC again in 1982 (the Tru Blu [[Ford XD Falcon|XD Falcon]]), 1984 (Greens Tuff [[Ford XE Falcon|XE Falcon]]), 1988 ([[Ford Sierra RS500]]) and 1989 (Sierra RS500). He also won Bathurst in 1989 (in a Ford Sierra with [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]) and 1994 (in an EB Falcon, also with Bowe). The names Tru Blu, and Greens Tuff, as well as Red Roo (seen in late 1982 only) were product names of Palmer Tube Mills.\n\nWith much larger budgets required in the racing industry, Ross Palmer helped negotiate for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] to be the team's primary sponsor from [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987]]. The larger budget allowed the team to expand from just one car for Dick, to a second [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] for his then team mate [[Gregg Hansford]].\n\n==NASCAR==\nIn 1989 and 1990, prompted by Palmer Tube Mills who assisted him in receiving multiple sources of sponsorship and through the company's American offshoot Redkote, Johnson made a brief foray into the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] driving a [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], entering a total of seven races with a best start of 11th at [[Sears Point Raceway]] in his first race, and a best finish of 22nd at [[Pocono Raceway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |title=Dick Johnson |publisher=[[NASCAR]] |accessdate=15 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504223535/http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |archivedate=4 May 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref> Johnson also drove a Thunderbird in the first NASCAR race held in Australia, the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500]] at the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]]. Unfortunately for Johnson he was involved in an early race crash which put him out of the event.\n\n==Retirement==\nDick Johnson retired from racing at the end of the 1999 season, though he remains in charge of DJR. He did however make a one off final appearance in front of his home crowd at the Queensland 500 in 2000 with his son [[Steven Johnson (motor racing)|Steven]] who had taken over driving Dick's famous Number 17 and continued to for over a decade after.<ref name=\"out of seat\">{{cite web| title=Steven Johnson Out of Driver's Seat at DJR| url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/02/24/steven-johnson-out-of-drivers-seat-at-djr/| publisher=speedcafe.com| accessdate=22 July 2013| date=24 February 2013}}</ref> Johnson has twice written his autobiography as well as contributing to a third biography.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\">{{cite book| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Don't Tell Me I Can't Do That| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Don_t_Tell_Me_I_Can_t_Do_That.html?id=LCpAAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y| publisher=Pan Macmillan| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=243 pages| year=2000| isbn=9780732910464}}</ref><ref name=autobiography>{{cite web| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Dick Johnson: The autobiography of a true-blue Aussie sporting legend| url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| publisher=Random House| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=432 pages| year=2013| isbn=9781742759777| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725004007/http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| archivedate=25 July 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Unforgiving Minute\">{{cite book| last=Tuckey| first=Bill| title=The Unforgiving Minute.

Johnson and co-driver John French were also wired for sound so the commentary team could talk to the drivers while racing around the track. From then on Johnson's cars were rarely without a TV camera sitting where the passenger seat usually was, especially when Seven was televising the race. His laconic commentary and seemingly endless list of one-liners quickly became a favourite with Australian race fans, even those who normally followed Holden drivers such as Peter Brock and Allan Grice, both of whom also became exponents of using racecam.\n\nSome of Johnson's quotes while on racecam were:\n* \"I've got one black [[BMW E24|BMW]] in front of me, one behind me. [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] and his [[All Blacks]]\" \u2013 [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985 ATCC]], Round 5 at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] while he was sandwiched between the black [[JPS Team BMW]]'s of [[New Zealander]]s [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Neville Crichton]]. Gardner was the JPS team manager.\n* \"The old [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo]] must have its truck suspension in\" \u2013 [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship|1986 ATCC]], Round 4 at Adelaide International. Ironically [[Robbie Francevic]]'s Volvo emerged as the race winner.\n* \"This race is like the Irishman who won the [[Tour de France]] I tell ya. He had to go on a lap of honour\" \u2013 [[1986 James Hardie 1000]]\n* \"This is where I lose so much time. I mean, this part of the track is just so boring\" \u2013 1986 Bathurst referring to his [[Ford Windsor engine|V8]] [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang's]] lack of grunt compared to his competitors on the run up [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mountain Straight]].\n* \"It's missing and carrying on like an old sheila\" \u2013 [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 ATCC]], Grand Finale at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after turbo boost problems with his championship winning [[Ford Sierra RS500]] saw him relinquish the lead mid-race to team mate [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]. With the opposition nowhere in sight, Bowe later slowed enough to allow Dick to win the race and followed him across the line in a 1\u20132 form finish.\n* \"Winton? Its like running a marathon around your clothesline\" \u2013 [[1990 Australian Touring Car Championship|1990 ATCC]], Round 4 at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]] after [[ATN|Channel 7]] commentator Mike Raymond asked him what the definition of Winton was.\n* \"Then [[Peter Brock|Brock]] got past me would you believe, unfortunately, and that thing of his like, I nearly choked to death on [[Mobil|Mobil 1]]. It looks like the last train to Ferny Grove\" \u2013 1990 ATCC, Grand Finale at Oran Park after problems with the Sierra saw him drop out of race winning and championship contention. He was referring to the Peter Brock Sierra's habit of belching black oil smoke out of its exhaust whenever he lifted off the accelerator.\n* \"The Sierra on one cylinder has got as much grunt as the [[Holden Commodore SS Group A#VN SS Group A SV|Commodore]]\" \u2013 [[1991 Australian Touring Car Championship|1991 ATCC]], Round 5 at Winton after his misfiring Sierra had been passed by the [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] Holden Commodore of [[Larry Perkins]].\n* \"You've got to be joking\" \u2013 [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995 ATCC]], [[Mount Panorama ATCC sprint round|Round 3]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]]. Channel 7 had just crossed to Johnson with Mike Raymond asking \"Are you lonely?\". Johnson's quote came immediately after as he spun his [[Ford EF Falcon]] into Caltex Chase, seemingly distracted by Raymond's interruption. However, as the TV camera's soon picked up, the rear wing of the Falcon had collapsed at over {{Convert|280|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} as he was turning into the fastest corner on any Australian race circuit, at the same moment that Seven crossed to talk to him.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ds4PU_PweU Dick Johnson rear wing snap \u2013 1995 ATCC Bathurst]</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Florigen", "text_new": "'''Florigen''' (or '''flowering hormone''') is the hypothesized [[hormone]]-like molecule responsible for controlling and/or triggering [[flowering]] in plants. Florigen is produced in the [[leaf|leaves]], and acts in the [[shoot apical meristem]] of [[bud]]s and growing tips. It is known to be graft-transmissible, and even functions between species. However, despite having been sought since the 1930s, the exact nature of florigen is still disputed.\n\n==Mechanism ==\n\nCentral to the hunt for florigen is an understanding of how plants use seasonal changes in day length to mediate flowering\u2014a mechanism known as [[photoperiodism]]. Plants which exhibit photoperiodism may be either 'short day' or 'long day' plants, which in order to flower require short days or long days respectively, although plants in fact distinguish day length from night length.<ref name=\"Garner1920\">{{cite journal|author1=Garner W.W. |author2=Allard H.A. |year= 1920 |title=Effect of the relative length of day and night and other factors of the environment on growth and reproduction in plants |journal= Monthly Weather Review|volume=18 |pages=553\u2013606 |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1920)48<415b:EOTRLO>2.0.CO;2| issue=7|bibcode=1920MWRv...48..415G |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe current model suggests the involvement of multiple different factors. Research into florigen is predominately centred on the model organism and long day plant, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\"Distinct roles of GIGANTEA\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\"Distinct roles of GIGANTEA\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Begin the Beguine]]\". Before the release of \"Beguine\", Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as ''[[Third Stream]]'' music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as [[Monty Norman]] in England, with the vamp of the [[James Bond Theme]], possibly influenced by 1938's \"Nightmare\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/short-history-nightmare-artie-shaw-1936/|title=A short history of\u2026 \"Nightmare\" (Artie Shaw, 1936)|last=Micucci|first=Matt|date=2017-07-18|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\nShaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various [[big band]]s he led. He served in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] from 1942 to 1944, (during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of [[World War II]]) and, following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Artie Shaw, King of the Clarinet: His Life and Times|last = Nolan|first = Tom|publisher = W.

Shaw bought a saxophone by working in a grocery store and began learning the saxophone at 13. At 16, he switched to the clarinet and left home to tour with a band.\n\n==Career==\nReturning to New York, he became a session musician through the early 1930s. From 1925\u201336, Shaw performed with many bands and orchestras; from 1926 to 1929, he worked in [[Cleveland]] and established a lasting reputation as music director and arranger for an orchestra led by the violinist Austin Wylie. In 1929 and 1930, he played with [[Irving Aaronson]]'s Commanders, where he was exposed to symphonic music, which he would later incorporate in his arrangements. In 1932, Shaw joined the [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] Orchestra and made several recordings with the outfit including \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\" and [[Fit as a Fiddle (song)|\"Fit as a Fiddle\"]].\n\n===Leader of bands===\nIn 1935, he first gained attention with his \"Interlude in B-flat\" at a swing concert at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theater]] in New York.<ref name=\"white\">White, John.

Following the breakup of what was already his second band in 1939, he rarely toured at all and, if he did, his personal appearances were usually limited to long-term engagements in a single venue or bookings that did not require much traveling, unlike many bands of the era that traveled great distances doing seemingly endless strings of one-night engagements.\n\n===Radio days===\n[[File:Artie Shaw Playing.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Artie Shaw performs his \"[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]\" in 1940.]]\nShaw did many [[big band remote]] broadcasts. Throughout the autumn and winter of 1938, he was often heard from the Blue Room of the Hotel Lincoln in New York. After touring in 1939, he led the house band at the Cafe Rouge of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. He was the headliner of a radio series with comedian [[Robert Benchley]] as emcee.<ref name=\"white\"/> Shaw broadcast on CBS from November 20, 1938 until November 14, 1939. At the Cafe Rouge he quit his band that week and went to Mexico. The band continued without him into January but eventually broke up. After Shaw returned from Mexico in 1940, and still under contract to RCA Victor, he experimented with a group of session musicians in Hollywood, trying to combine strings and woodwinds with a jazz band. The result was the hit \"Frenesi\".\n\nHe was hired as bandleader for the ''Burns and Allen Show'' broadcast from Hollywood. He organized a band that was modeled after his swing band concept of the late 1930s with the addition of six violins, two violas, and one cello. The addition of a string section to a popular big band was not novel, as it had been done by [[Paul Whiteman]] and others since the 1920s. Shaw updated the idea with the music trends of the 1940s. Strings gave him a wider tonal palette and allowed him to concentrate on ballads rather than the fast dance songs of the swing era. Shaw was at or near the top of the list of virtuoso jazz bandleaders. The band was showcased on the Burns and Allen program every week.\n\nIn 1940, at the height of his popularity, the 30-year-old Shaw earned up to $60,000 per week.<ref name=\"white\"/> In contrast, [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]] were each making $5,000 per week during the year that Shaw and his orchestra provided the music for their radio show.<ref>\"Business & Finance: Nat & Googie\". ''Time''. January 30, 1933.</ref> He acted on the show as a love interest for Gracie Allen, although he disliked having to be a part of the celebrity culture of the period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dismuke.org/how/prev1-05.html|title=Dismuke's Hit Of The Week|website=Dismuke.org}}</ref>\n\nShaw's contract was renewed for another 13 weeks when the program was moved to New York. Shaw broke up the Hollywood band, keeping a nucleus of seven musicians in addition to himself, and filled out the ensemble with New York musicians until March 1941. While taking a few months vacation in the spring of 1941 to reassess what to do next, Shaw recorded in another small group format with three horns and a four-man rhythm section with the addition of a dozen strings and. By September, he formed a big band with seven brass, five saxes, four rhythm, and fifteen strings. Remote broadcasts noted the band performing in good form and Shaw dazzling the crowd with his clarinet. On December 7, three months into the tour, the 31-piece band was in the midst of a matinee performance in Providence, Rhode Island, when he was given a note about the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The note instructed him to tell military personnel to return to their bases. As the audience left, he knew the band was coming to an end.\n\n===War and after===\n[[File:Artie Shaw and the Rangers.jpg|thumb|Artie Shaw and The Rangers, 1943]]\nDuring World War II, Shaw enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] and shortly after formed a band, which served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]] (just as [[Glenn Miller]]'s wartime band served in the UK and Europe). After 18 months playing for Navy personnel, (sometimes as many as four concerts a day in battle zones, including [[Guadalcanal]]), Shaw returned to the U.S. in a state of physical exhaustion and received a medical discharge.<ref>Susman, Gary. \"Goodbye\", ''Entertainment Weekly''. January 3, 2005.</ref> After the war, the popularity of big bands declined, as [[Crooner|Crooners]] and [[Bebop]] began to dominate the charts.\n\n[[File:Artie Shaw (Gottlieb 07771).jpg|thumb|left|Artie Shaw, ca 1947. Photograph by [[William P. Gottlieb]]]]\n\nShaw credited his time in the Navy from 1942 to 1944 as a period of renewed introspection.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{Cite book|last=Shaw|first=Artie|title=The Trouble with Cinderella|year=1952|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Young|isbn=1-56474-020-X|url=https://archive.org/details/troublewithcinde00shaw}}</ref> After his discharge, he entered psychoanalysis and began to withdraw from music in favor of a writing career. His autobiography, ''The Trouble With Cinderella: An Outline of Identity'', was published in 1952 (with later reprint editions in 1992 and 2001). Revealing downbeat elements of the music business, Shaw explained that \"the trouble with Cinderella\" is \"nobody ever lives happily ever after.\"<ref name=\"autobio\"/> He turned to semi-autobiographical fiction with the three short novels in ''I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!'' (1965, reprinted in 1997), which prompted [[Terry Southern]]'s comment: \"Here is a deeply probing examination of the American marital scene. I flipped over it!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artieshaw.com/books-ily.html|title=Books by Artie Shaw- I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!|date=June 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615221645/http://www.artieshaw.com/books-ily.html|archive-date=June 15, 2008}}</ref> Shaw's short stories, including \"Snow White in Harlem\", were collected in ''The Best of Intentions and Other Stories'' (1989). He worked for years on his 1000-page autobiographical novel, ''The Education of Albie Snow'', but the three-volume work remained unpublished.\n\nAfter his discharge in 1944, he formed another band, this time what could be considered a modern big band in that it contained what is now considered the standard eight brass and five saxes. It did not include any strings and was based in Hollywood, California, where Shaw was living. He continued to record for RCA Victor, as he had before the war, and limited the band's personal appearances to military bases in California. In August 1945 his contract with RCA ended and he signed with an independent label, [[Musicraft]]. He made a few records for Musicraft before the band broke up, and all of the recordings for Musicraft from 1946 were staffed by top-notch session musicians. The big band was back in the studio, this time including strings. On these Musicraft recordings in 1946 Shaw featured the young singer Mel Torm\u00e9. On some of the sides, Torme was also featured with his vocal group the Meltones.\n\nIn July 1954, Shaw undertook a brief but historic Australian tour for promoter [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]] on which he shared the bill with drummer [[Buddy Rich]] and vocalist [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. After completing that tour Shaw stopped playing the clarinet, citing his own perfectionism, which, he later said, would have killed him. He explained to a reporter, \"In the world we live in, compulsive perfectionists finish last. You have to be [[Lawrence Welk]] or, on another level, [[Irving Berlin]], and write the same kind of music over and over again. I'm not able to do that, and I have taken the clarinet as far as anyone can possibly go. To continue playing would be a disservice.\"<ref>Freedland, Michael. \"'Jazz is like jumping off a cliff'\", ''The Telegraph'', March 15, 2001.</ref> He spent the rest of the 1950s living in Europe.\n\nIn 1983, after years of prodding by Williard Alexander, the 73-year-old Shaw organized a band and selected clarinetist [[Dick Johnson (clarinetist)|Dick Johnson]] as bandleader and soloist. The 58-year-old Johnson, an accomplished woodwind and saxophonist and native of Brockton, Massachusetts, was no stranger to jazz having recorded numerous albums of his own and had idolized Shaw's playing throughout his life. Shaw's music library, which was the product of his almost 20 years of activity in the music business, contained numerous arrangements of monumental status of popular music in addition to many original big band jazz compositions of the era. It was a collection of music arranged by some of the foremost composer/arrangers of the period, much of which was sketched out by Shaw himself and filled in and completed by his orchestrator/arranger collaborators, among them [[Jerry Gray]], [[William Grant Still]], [[Lennie Hayton]], Ray Conniff, [[Eddie Sauter]], and [[Jimmy Mundy]], to name a few. Shaw rehearsed his new band, (based out of Boston, Massachusetts), and the band made its official debut on New Year's Eve 1984 at the [[Glen Island Casino]] in [[New Rochelle]], New York, the same launching pad for many bands of the swing era decades earlier, when Shaw and his bands were in their prime. Shaw appeared with the band throughout its first few years, limiting his role to being its conductor and front man, while leaving the clarinet playing duties to Johnson. In 1985, another week-long series of strenuous rehearsals followed during which Shaw added more repertoire, including many arrangements and compositions that were from the later years of his career Shaw had never recorded. By 1987 though, Shaw was no longer touring with the band, quietly content that Johnson and the band kept true to Shaw's band spirit and vision. He would, however, show up on occasion \"just to hear how things sounded\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Films and television===\nShaw made several musical shorts in 1939 for [[Vitaphone]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. He portrayed himself in the [[Fred Astaire]] film, ''[[Second Chorus]]'' (1940), which featured Shaw and his orchestra playing ''[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]'', and his 1940\u201341 Hollywood period ''Star Dust'' band can be heard throughout the soundtrack. The film garnered him two Oscar nominations for Best Score and Best Song (\"Love of My Life\").<ref>Wilson, Jeff. \"Artie Shaw, 94: Top bandleader of swing era\". ''Toronto Star''. December 30, 2004.</ref> He collaborated on the love song \"If It's You\", sung by [[Tony Martin (entertainer)|Tony Martin]] in the [[Marx Brothers]]' film ''[[The Big Store]]'' (1941). In 1950, he was a mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and on August 31, 1952, was part of the panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789600/|title=Artie Shaw|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}</ref> During the 1970s he made appearances on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Johnny Carson]].\n\nMany of his recordings have been used in motion pictures. His 1940 recording of \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\" was used in its entirety in the closing credits of the film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''. [[Martin Scorsese]] also used the Shaw theme song, \"Nightmare\", in his [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Howard Hughes]] biopic, ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]].''\n\nCanadian filmmaker Brigitte Berman interviewed [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Doc Cheatham]], and others including Shaw for her documentary film, ''Bix: Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet'' (1981) about [[Bix Beiderbecke]], and afterward she went on to create an [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary, ''Artie Shaw: Time Is All You've Got'' (1985), featuring extensive interviews with Shaw, Buddy Rich, Mel Torm\u00e9, Helen Forrest, and other musicians, in addition to Shaw's eighth wife, actress [[Evelyn Keyes]]. The documentary ends with Shaw rehearsing his new band with co-leader Johnson present and rolls to credits perhaps quite fittingly with the band taking a final segue to Shaw's theme song ''Nightmare.'' In 2000, filmmaker [[Ken Burns]] interviewed Shaw at his home for his PBS documentary/miniseries ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' where Shaw appears in multiple segments. His last major interview was in 2003, when he was interviewed by [[Russell Davies]] for the [[BBC]] Television documentary, ''Artie Shaw \u2013 Quest for Perfection''. The documentary includes interviews with surviving members of his original bands, Johnson, and other music industry professionals.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\nA self-proclaimed \"very difficult man\",<ref>Wadler, Joyce. \"Artie Shaw, Without Music\".

In 1940, before eloping with [[Lana Turner]], Shaw briefly dated actress [[Judy Garland]]<ref name=Lana>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Lana|title=Lana: The Lady, The Legend, The Truth|year=1982|publisher=Dutton Adult; 1st edition|isbn=978-0525241065|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lanatheladylegen00turn/page/40 40\u201349]|url=https://archive.org/details/lanatheladylegen00turn/page/40}}</ref> and, according to Tom Nolan's biography, had an affair with [[Lena Horne]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1946, Shaw was present at a meeting of the Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions. [[Olivia de Havilland]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], part of a core group of actors and artists who were trying to sway the organization away from [[Communism]], presented an [[anti-Communist]] declaration which, if signed, was set to run in newspapers. There was bedlam as many rose to champion the communist cause, and Shaw began praising the democratic standards of the Soviet constitution.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115757993223555601|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=Olivia de Havilland Recalls Her Role &ndash; in the Cold War|first=John|last=Meroney|date=September 7, 2006}}</ref> In 1953, Shaw was forced to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for his [[collectivism|leftist]] activities.

In his later years, Shaw lived and wrote in the [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]] section of [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. He died on December 30, 2004, aged 94.

In 1991, the collection was transferred to the School of Music of the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson.

Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Begin the Beguine]]\". Before the release of \"Beguine\", Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as ''[[Third Stream]]'' music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as [[Monty Norman]] in England, with the vamp of the [[James Bond Theme]], possibly influenced by 1938's \"Nightmare\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/short-history-nightmare-artie-shaw-1936/|title=A short history of\u2026 \"Nightmare\" (Artie Shaw, 1936)|last=Micucci|first=Matt|date=2017-07-18|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\nShaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various [[big band]]s he led. He served in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] from 1942 to 1944, (during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of [[World War II]]) and, following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Artie Shaw, King of the Clarinet: His Life and Times|last = Nolan|first = Tom|publisher = W.

Shaw bought a saxophone by working in a grocery store and began learning the saxophone at 13. At 16, he switched to the clarinet and left home to tour with a band.\n\n==Career==\nReturning to New York, he became a session musician through the early 1930s. From 1925\u201336, Shaw performed with many bands and orchestras; from 1926 to 1929, he worked in [[Cleveland]] and established a lasting reputation as music director and arranger for an orchestra led by the violinist Austin Wylie. In 1929 and 1930, he played with [[Irving Aaronson]]'s Commanders, where he was exposed to symphonic music, which he would later incorporate in his arrangements. In 1932, Shaw joined the [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] Orchestra and made several recordings with the outfit including \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\" and [[Fit as a Fiddle (song)|\"Fit as a Fiddle\"]].\n\n===Leader of bands===\nIn 1935, he first gained attention with his \"Interlude in B-flat\" at a swing concert at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theater]] in New York.<ref name=\"white\">White, John.

The Gramercy Five's biggest hit was \"Summit Ridge Drive\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1633240/m1/#track/1 |title = Pop Chronicles 1940s Program #5|year = 1972}}</ref> one of Shaw's million-selling singles. His last prewar band, organized in September 1941, included Oran \"Hot Lips\" Page, Max Kaminsky, Georgie Auld, [[Dave Tough]], [[Jack Jenney]], [[Ray Conniff]] and Guarnieri.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_shaw_artie.htm|title=JAZZ A Film By Ken Burns: Selected Artist Biography \u2013 Artie Shaw|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his career, Shaw had a habit of forming bands, developing them according to his immediate aspirations, making a quick series of records, and then disbanding. He generally did not stick around long enough to reap his bands' successes through live performances of their recorded hits. Following the breakup of what was already his second band in 1939, he rarely toured at all and, if he did, his personal appearances were usually limited to long-term engagements in a single venue or bookings that did not require much traveling, unlike many bands of the era that traveled great distances doing seemingly endless strings of one-night engagements. Apart from his interest in music, Shaw had a tremendous intellect and almost insatiable thirst for intellectual knowledge and literature. During his self-imposed \"sabbaticals\" from the music business, his interests included studying advanced mathematics, as cited in [[Karl Sabbagh]]'s ''The [[Riemann Hypothesis]]''.<ref name=\"Riemann\">Sabbagh, Karl. ''The Riemann Hypothesis: The Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics'', Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2004; {{ISBN|0-374-52935-3}}</ref>\n\nThe long series of musical groups Shaw formed included [[Billie Holiday]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Helen Forrest]], [[Mel Torm\u00e9]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[Dave Tough]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Dodo Marmarosa]], and [[Ray Conniff]]. He used the morose \"Nightmare\", with its [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] nuances, as his theme rather than choosing a more accessible song. In a televised interview in the 1970s, Shaw derided the \"asinine\" songs of [[Tin Pan Alley]] that were the lifeblood of popular music and which bands, especially the most popular (such as his own) were compelled to play night after night. In 1994, he told Frank Prial (''[[The New York Times]]''), \"I thought that because I was Artie Shaw I could do what I wanted, but all they wanted was 'Begin the Beguine'\".<ref>Prial, Frank J. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DD1F30F93BA2575BC0A962958260 \"At Home with: Artie Shaw; Literary Life, After Ending the Beguine\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 1994.</ref>\n\n===Radio days===\n[[File:Artie Shaw Playing.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Artie Shaw performs his \"[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]\" in 1940.]]\nShaw did many [[big band remote]] broadcasts. Throughout the autumn and winter of 1938, he was often heard from the Blue Room of the Hotel Lincoln in New York. After touring in 1939, he led the house band at the Cafe Rouge of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. He was the headliner of a radio series with comedian [[Robert Benchley]] as emcee.<ref name=\"white\"/> Shaw broadcast on CBS from November 20, 1938 until November 14, 1939. At the Cafe Rouge he quit his band that week and went to Mexico. The band continued without him into January but eventually broke up. After Shaw returned from Mexico in 1940, and still under contract to RCA Victor, he experimented with a group of session musicians in Hollywood, trying to combine strings and woodwinds with a jazz band. The result was the hit \"Frenesi\".\n\nHe was hired as bandleader for the ''Burns and Allen Show'' broadcast from Hollywood. He organized a band that was modeled after his swing band concept of the late 1930s with the addition of six violins, two violas, and one cello. The addition of a string section to a popular big band was not novel, as it had been done by [[Paul Whiteman]] and others since the 1920s. Shaw updated the idea with the music trends of the 1940s. Strings gave him a wider tonal palette and allowed him to concentrate on ballads rather than the fast dance songs of the swing era. Shaw was at or near the top of the list of virtuoso jazz bandleaders. The band was showcased on the Burns and Allen program every week.\n\nIn 1940, at the height of his popularity, the 30-year-old Shaw earned up to $60,000 per week.<ref name=\"white\"/> In contrast, [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]] were each making $5,000 per week during the year that Shaw and his orchestra provided the music for their radio show.<ref>\"Business & Finance: Nat & Googie\". ''Time''. January 30, 1933.</ref> He acted on the show as a love interest for Gracie Allen, although he disliked having to be a part of the celebrity culture of the period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dismuke.org/how/prev1-05.html|title=Dismuke's Hit Of The Week|website=Dismuke.org}}</ref>\n\nShaw's contract was renewed for another 13 weeks when the program was moved to New York. Shaw broke up the Hollywood band, keeping a nucleus of seven musicians in addition to himself, and filled out the ensemble with New York musicians until March 1941. While taking a few months vacation in the spring of 1941 to reassess what to do next, Shaw recorded in another small group format with three horns and a four-man rhythm section with the addition of a dozen strings and. By September, he formed a big band with seven brass, five saxes, four rhythm, and fifteen strings. Remote broadcasts noted the band performing in good form and Shaw dazzling the crowd with his clarinet. On December 7, three months into the tour, the 31-piece band was in the midst of a matinee performance in Providence, Rhode Island, when he was given a note about the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The note instructed him to tell military personnel to return to their bases. As the audience left, he knew the band was coming to an end.\n\n===War and after===\n[[File:Artie Shaw and the Rangers.jpg|thumb|Artie Shaw and The Rangers, 1943]]\nDuring World War II, Shaw enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] and shortly after formed a band, which served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]] (just as [[Glenn Miller]]'s wartime band served in the UK and Europe). After 18 months playing for Navy personnel, (sometimes as many as four concerts a day in battle zones, including [[Guadalcanal]]), Shaw returned to the U.S. in a state of physical exhaustion and received a medical discharge.<ref>Susman, Gary. \"Goodbye\", ''Entertainment Weekly''. January 3, 2005.</ref> After the war, the popularity of big bands declined, as [[Crooner|Crooners]] and [[Bebop]] began to dominate the charts.\n\n[[File:Artie Shaw (Gottlieb 07771).jpg|thumb|left|Artie Shaw, ca 1947. Photograph by [[William P. Gottlieb]]]]\n\nShaw credited his time in the Navy from 1942 to 1944 as a period of renewed introspection.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{Cite book|last=Shaw|first=Artie|title=The Trouble with Cinderella|year=1952|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Young|isbn=1-56474-020-X|url=https://archive.org/details/troublewithcinde00shaw}}</ref> After his discharge, he entered psychoanalysis and began to withdraw from music in favor of a writing career. His autobiography, ''The Trouble With Cinderella: An Outline of Identity'', was published in 1952 (with later reprint editions in 1992 and 2001). Revealing downbeat elements of the music business, Shaw explained that \"the trouble with Cinderella\" is \"nobody ever lives happily ever after.\"<ref name=\"autobio\"/> He turned to semi-autobiographical fiction with the three short novels in ''I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!'' (1965, reprinted in 1997), which prompted [[Terry Southern]]'s comment: \"Here is a deeply probing examination of the American marital scene. I flipped over it!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artieshaw.com/books-ily.html|title=Books by Artie Shaw- I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!|date=June 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615221645/http://www.artieshaw.com/books-ily.html|archive-date=June 15, 2008}}</ref> Shaw's short stories, including \"Snow White in Harlem\", were collected in ''The Best of Intentions and Other Stories'' (1989). He worked for years on his 1000-page autobiographical novel, ''The Education of Albie Snow'', but the three-volume work remained unpublished.\n\nAfter his discharge in 1944, he formed another band, this time what could be considered a modern big band in that it contained what is now considered the standard eight brass and five saxes. It did not include any strings and was based in Hollywood, California, where Shaw was living. He continued to record for RCA Victor, as he had before the war, and limited the band's personal appearances to military bases in California. In August 1945 his contract with RCA ended and he signed with an independent label, [[Musicraft]]. He made a few records for Musicraft before the band broke up, and all of the recordings for Musicraft from 1946 were staffed by top-notch session musicians. The big band was back in the studio, this time including strings. On these Musicraft recordings in 1946 Shaw featured the young singer Mel Torm\u00e9. On some of the sides, Torme was also featured with his vocal group the Meltones.\n\nIn July 1954, Shaw undertook a brief but historic Australian tour for promoter [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]] on which he shared the bill with drummer [[Buddy Rich]] and vocalist [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. After completing that tour Shaw stopped playing the clarinet, citing his own perfectionism, which, he later said, would have killed him. He explained to a reporter, \"In the world we live in, compulsive perfectionists finish last. You have to be [[Lawrence Welk]] or, on another level, [[Irving Berlin]], and write the same kind of music over and over again. I'm not able to do that, and I have taken the clarinet as far as anyone can possibly go. To continue playing would be a disservice.\"<ref>Freedland, Michael. \"'Jazz is like jumping off a cliff'\", ''The Telegraph'', March 15, 2001.</ref> He spent the rest of the 1950s living in Europe.\n\nIn 1983, after years of prodding by Williard Alexander, the 73-year-old Shaw organized a band and selected clarinetist [[Dick Johnson (clarinetist)|Dick Johnson]] as bandleader and soloist. The 58-year-old Johnson, an accomplished woodwind and saxophonist and native of Brockton, Massachusetts, was no stranger to jazz having recorded numerous albums of his own and had idolized Shaw's playing throughout his life. Shaw's music library, which was the product of his almost 20 years of activity in the music business, contained numerous arrangements of monumental status of popular music in addition to many original big band jazz compositions of the era. It was a collection of music arranged by some of the foremost composer/arrangers of the period, much of which was sketched out by Shaw himself and filled in and completed by his orchestrator/arranger collaborators, among them [[Jerry Gray]], [[William Grant Still]], [[Lennie Hayton]], Ray Conniff, [[Eddie Sauter]], and [[Jimmy Mundy]], to name a few. Shaw rehearsed his new band, (based out of Boston, Massachusetts), and the band made its official debut on New Year's Eve 1984 at the [[Glen Island Casino]] in [[New Rochelle]], New York, the same launching pad for many bands of the swing era decades earlier, when Shaw and his bands were in their prime. Shaw appeared with the band throughout its first few years, limiting his role to being its conductor and front man, while leaving the clarinet playing duties to Johnson. In 1985, another week-long series of strenuous rehearsals followed during which Shaw added more repertoire, including many arrangements and compositions that were from the later years of his career Shaw had never recorded. By 1987 though, Shaw was no longer touring with the band, quietly content that Johnson and the band kept true to Shaw's band spirit and vision. He would, however, show up on occasion \"just to hear how things sounded\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Films and television===\nShaw made several musical shorts in 1939 for [[Vitaphone]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. He portrayed himself in the [[Fred Astaire]] film, ''[[Second Chorus]]'' (1940), which featured Shaw and his orchestra playing ''[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]'', and his 1940\u201341 Hollywood period ''Star Dust'' band can be heard throughout the soundtrack. The film garnered him two Oscar nominations for Best Score and Best Song (\"Love of My Life\").<ref>Wilson, Jeff. \"Artie Shaw, 94: Top bandleader of swing era\". ''Toronto Star''. December 30, 2004.</ref> He collaborated on the love song \"If It's You\", sung by [[Tony Martin (entertainer)|Tony Martin]] in the [[Marx Brothers]]' film ''[[The Big Store]]'' (1941). In 1950, he was a mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and on August 31, 1952, was part of the panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789600/|title=Artie Shaw|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}</ref> During the 1970s he made appearances on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Johnny Carson]].\n\nMany of his recordings have been used in motion pictures. His 1940 recording of \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\" was used in its entirety in the closing credits of the film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''. [[Martin Scorsese]] also used the Shaw theme song, \"Nightmare\", in his [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Howard Hughes]] biopic, ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]].''\n\nCanadian filmmaker Brigitte Berman interviewed [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Doc Cheatham]], and others including Shaw for her documentary film, ''Bix: Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet'' (1981) about [[Bix Beiderbecke]], and afterward she went on to create an [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary, ''Artie Shaw: Time Is All You've Got'' (1985), featuring extensive interviews with Shaw, Buddy Rich, Mel Torm\u00e9, Helen Forrest, and other musicians, in addition to Shaw's eighth wife, actress [[Evelyn Keyes]]. The documentary ends with Shaw rehearsing his new band with co-leader Johnson present and rolls to credits perhaps quite fittingly with the band taking a final segue to Shaw's theme song ''Nightmare.'' In 2000, filmmaker [[Ken Burns]] interviewed Shaw at his home for his PBS documentary/miniseries ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' where Shaw appears in multiple segments. His last major interview was in 2003, when he was interviewed by [[Russell Davies]] for the [[BBC]] Television documentary, ''Artie Shaw \u2013 Quest for Perfection''. The documentary includes interviews with surviving members of his original bands, Johnson, and other music industry professionals.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\nA self-proclaimed \"very difficult man\",<ref>Wadler, Joyce. \"Artie Shaw, Without Music\".

[[Olivia de Havilland]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], part of a core group of actors and artists who were trying to sway the organization away from [[Communism]], presented an [[anti-Communist]] declaration which, if signed, was set to run in newspapers.

In 1991, the collection was transferred to the School of Music of the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson.
