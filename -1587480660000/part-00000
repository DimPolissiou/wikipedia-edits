Mailer believed ''The Naked and the Dead'' to be his most renowned work. It became the first popular novel about World War II and is considered one of the greatest English-language novels.<ref>[[John Bear]], ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992, pp. 31-39</ref> It was later adapted into a [[The Naked and the Dead (film)|film]] in 1958.\n\nIn 1998 the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''The Naked and the Dead'' 51st on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe novel is divided into four parts: Wave, Argil and Mold, Plant and Phantom, and Wake. Within these parts are chorus sections, consisting of play-like dialogue between characters, as well as Time Machine sections, which give brief histories and flashbacks of individual characters\u2019 lives.\n\nThe story takes place on Anopopei, a fictional island somewhere in the South Pacific. American forces are faced with a campaign to drive out the Japanese so that Americans can advance into the Philippines. The novel focuses on the experiences of one platoon.\n\n===Part One, Wave===\nCharacters are introduced as they wait around for orders. A naval bombardment takes place. The men take their places on a boat and are driven to the invasion shore. Here, they fire back and forth at the Japanese.\n\nHennessey becomes so frightened that he soils in his pants. Overcome by panic, he runs out of his foxhole and is killed by shrapnel from a mortar round. Part One concludes with this death, which alarms many of the men, since for many soldiers Hennessey\u2019s death is the first comrade death they witness.\n\n===Part Two, Argil and Mold===\nThe campaign continues. General Cummings has a soft spot for Lieutenant Hearn, the only officer he can relate to intellectually; they have many discussions together. At one point, the platoon takes a Japanese soldier as prisoner. When Gallagher gives the Japanese soldier a cigarette to smoke, the soldier closes his eyes in relaxation. At this moment, Croft shoots and kills him, demonstrating his coldblooded personality.\n\nLater, Gallagher receives word that his wife, Mary, died in childbirth. Although Gallagher\u2019s child survived, he is overcome by immense grief throughout the rest of the novel.\n\n===Part Three, Plant and Phantom===\nHearn is assigned by Cummings to lead the platoon through the jungle and up Mountain Anaka, to find a way to the rear of the enemy. After a clash with the Japanese, Wilson is shot and left behind.\n\nCroft sends men back to get Wilson. Brown, Stanley, Goldstein, and Ridges then carry Wilson back to the beach on a stretcher. The trip takes several days, and Wilson ends up dying. The men eventually lose Wilson\u2019s body in a river.\n\nCroft manipulates Hearn into walking into an ambush, and Hearn is killed, leaving Croft in charge. The men continue hiking up the mountain on Croft\u2019s orders, even though many men view it as a hopeless cause. Later, Roth dies while attempting to make a jump on the mountain\u2019s edge.\n\nTrudging on, the men eventually give up their task of climbing the mountain. They return to the beach where Brown, Stanley, Goldstein, and Ridges have arrived from their mission with Wilson.\n\nThey learn that the battle for the island is almost won. Surprisingly, the ruthless Croft seems to be relieved that he was unable to climb the mountain. At the end of Part Three, the remaining men discuss their future and how it will feel when they return home now that their mission is over.\n\n===Part Four, Wake===\nThis part consists of one short chapter. Cummings reflects on the war. He is disappointed that the victory was too easy (it came as a result of exhaustion of Japanese troops) and that he cannot take the credit, as Major Dalleson, who acted as his deputy for a day, won the battle just by obeying established procedures. Major Dalleson then wonders about the new training program that will take place with new troops the next day.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n*'''Hennessey''' is a newer member of the platoon. He is very cautious with all of his gear and movements so as to not get killed. When they arrive at the beach of Anopopei, he defecates in his pants out of fear during the opening action scene. He has a mental break down and runs down the beach in hopes of getting new pants. He is killed soon after by shrapnel from an exploding mortar shell.\n*'''Woodrow Wilson''' is a large, impoverished white Southerner. He has a happy-go-lucky and generous nature. In his \"Time Machine\" we learn Wilson wakes up married to a woman named Alice after a drunken night at the bar. Their marriage consists of love affairs and money troubles. Later, Wilson suffers a long, agonizing death after being shot in the stomach by the Japanese; Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley try to carry him back to the beach to be saved but he dies on the way there.\n*'''Julio Martinez''' is a Mexican-American from Texas. He is nicknamed Japbait by Croft and made sergeant in General Cummings infantry division. Martinez was terrified, constantly on edge and an introvert throughout the beginning of the novel. He however, gains bravery through battle and is an excellent soldier, especially in terms of getting a scope for the land. He is well trusted by the other men in the platoon. Croft convinces Martinez to lie about a Japanese platoon he saw on a solo scouting mission, which leads to the death of Hearn and to the men hiking to Mount Anaka under Croft's command.\n*'''Sam Croft''' has a large ego and is coldblooded throughout the novel. At one point, he immorally kills a Japanese POW. Later, he squeezes Roth\u2019s baby bird to death as if he is crushing all innocence. He loves war and is Mailer\u2019s version of a psychopath within the novel. He is seen as one of the best soldiers in the platoon and the other men both fear and respect him as a leader. In his time capsule, we learned he was cheated on by the women he loved which led to him being cold and developing a love for war. At the conclusion of the book, Croft refuses to look forward to his homecoming, believing that the war will continue for much longer. After all, he enjoys the war because he finds a thrill in killing.\n*'''Red Valsen''' claims he does not want to rise in the ranks. He appears numb to death and the war itself. As a child, he grew up in a mine town in Montana. Later, he runs away from home, losing contact with his entire family. After holding many jobs, Red moves in with his girlfriend Lois and her son. Afraid of commitment, Red joins the Army and runs away from Lois. While in the Army, Red loses contact with Lois just like he did with his own family.\n*'''Lieutenant Robert Hearn''' is the stereotypical white liberal. Harvard educated and from an affluent family, Hearn is General Cummings\u2019 assistant. He despises the caste system within the Army, wishing that he could reach out to the lower class foot soldiers. Later, Cummings transfers Hearn to Dalleson\u2019s section. He leads the platoon through the jungle and to the mountain pass. Here, he is shot and killed quickly and anticlimactically not expecting Japanese resistance after Croft keeps the information from him.\n*'''General Edward Cummings''' is power-hungry, often comparing himself to God. As a child, Cummings experiences gender-role confusion. This forces his father to send him to military school. Later, Cummings attends West Point. While at West Point, he meets Margaret and feels socially pressured into marrying her. Margaret and Cummings are married and never have children. They have an unhappy marriage, perhaps due to Cummings homosexual tendencies and feelings. It is apparent through his conversations with Hearn that he has romantic feelings for him.\n*'''Roy Gallagher''' is Boston Irish and part of an Anti-Semitic gang called Christians United. He always seems angry throughout the novel. Later, he learns that his wife Mary died in childbirth, but their baby lived. Gallagher remains devastated for the rest of the novel.\n*'''Roth''' is a depressing, fickle stereotypical representation of a Jew. He, however, refuses to consider himself and strongly associate with being Jewish. Throughout the novel, he has a superiority complex because he is better educated than the other men of the platoon. Roth dies while climbing the mountain because he misses a jump and fails to grasp Gallagher\u2019s hand.\n*'''Joey Goldstein''' is also Jewish like Roth. However, unlike Roth, he does not view himself as better than his Christian friends. Goldstein grows up as a mamma\u2019s boy and desires to own his own shop. Later, he becomes a welder and marries Natalie, despite his mother\u2019s disapproval. After their son is born, Goldstein struggles to support his family and maintain a loving relationship with his wife. Throughout the war, Goldstein is well-respected by his comrades, although he does lack courage at times.\n*'''William Brown''' is the stereotypical well-liked, neighborhood boy. Growing up in a middle-class family, Brown later attends a state university. Here he joins a fraternity and flunks out by freshman year. He marries a girl from his high school, Beverly, and lives a fairly boring life. Throughout the war, he worries that Beverly will cheat on him while he\u2019s away. He is certain that he will throw her out of the house when he returns home.\n*'''Stanley''' insists that women are no different from men. He trusts his wife Ruthie, who is the mother of his child. In some ways, he is the quiet feminist within the novel. He is also more ambitious than the other soldiers, since he is inexperienced in war; he desires to move up in ranks and befriends Brown in order to do so. \n*'''Toglio''' is an Italian-American. Patriotic, trusting, and good-natured, he is friends with most of his platoon. He sustains a [[million-dollar wound]] during combat and is sent home. Subsequently, as time passes, some characters come to envy his wound and grow to hate him.\n*'''Casimir \"Polack\" Czienwicz''' comes from a lower-class Polish family. He grows up with seven siblings and, after his father dies, he enters the orphanage. At thirteen, an older woman seduces him multiple times. These experiences make Polack a tough, courageous soldier in the Army.\n*'''Oscar Ridges''' is extremely Christian. He assures Wyman, who refers to him as \u201cthe preacher,\u201d  that \u201cThe Lord\u2019ll keep me from shooting a Christian\u201d.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|218}} Despite his Christian beliefs, Ridges befriends Goldstein as his buddy. This friendship between a Jew and Christian demonstrates how the war brought men of different backgrounds together.\n*'''Buddy Wyman''' does not play a major role within the novel.  He dreams of becoming a war hero in order to support his mother and himself.\n*'''Steven Minetta''' is twenty years old and was known as the \u201cbest dresser on the block\u201d when he was growing up.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|60}} He is eventually wounded but then returns to the platoon. At the conclusion of the novel, Minetta feels anger towards power figures and hopes to \u201cexpose the goddam Army.\u201d {{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|711}}\n*'''Dalleson''' was second in command to Cummings. He was very nervous throughout the novel and did not trust his own judgment. At the end of the novel, however, it is Dalleson who helps them win the war against the Japanese Army.\n\n==Themes==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nThroughout the novel, Mailer dwells on many themes. These themes are recurring throughout his works and reappear in several of his later essays and novels.\n\n'''Dehumanization of soldiers''' Commenting on the dehumanization of soldiers in ''The Naked and the Dead,'' Mailer said, \"The book finds man corrupted, confused to the point of helplessness, but it also find that there are limits beyond which he cannot be pushed.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Shuster |location=New York |page=97}}</ref> The soldiers are continuously referred to as machines within the novel. At one point, the narrator describes this dehumanization stating, \u201cWhen a man was harnessed into a pack and web belt and carried a rifle and two bandoliers and several grenades, a bayonet and a helmet, he felt as if he had a tourniquet over both shoulders and across his chest. It was hard to breathe and his limbs kept falling asleep.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|24}} Thus, in this instance, the soldier is losing grasp of his bodily functions and simply going through the motions of being a \u201csoldier\u201d. \nDehumanization of the soldier is also seen in chapter 5 when the platoon had to carry antitank guns between 1st Battalion and A Company, which was about a mile of muddy trail. The men became numb and only went through the motions of carrying the guns. The generals disregarded the soldiers' exhaustion. This treatment of men as machines is reinforced throughout the novel. The expectation for the soldiers to fight off Japanese attacks despite their fear also demonstrates this dehumanization. The soldiers generally believed the army didn't see them as people and that \"they don't care if you live or die here [the infirmary]. All they want is to get you back where you can stop a bullet\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|chapter=The Naked and the Dead and Its Aftermath|pages=14\u201333|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctv6sj74q.5|isbn=978-1-61117-806-7|title=Understanding Norman Mailer|year=2017}}</ref>{{rp|354}} Meaning, when soldiers were injured, the Army didn't care about their well-being annd only cared that they would heal enough to go back out into warfare.\n\n'''Brotherhood:''' Another theme, brotherhood, is a positive feature in the novel. In feeling that they may not make it out alive, the soldiers developed strong friendships which are not relatable to people at home. Croft expresses his feelings of brotherhood and tells his comrades, \u201cYou\u2019re all good guys. You\u2019re all chicken, and you\u2019re all yellow, but you\u2019re good guys. They ain\u2019t a goddam thing wrong with you.\u201d, which is important to note considering Croft was the coldhearted character in the novel.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|202}} This idea of brotherhood is also seen within Part III when Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley attempt to carry the wounded Wilson back to camp. Despite the physical strains of carrying Wilson back, the men presisted wanting to save Wilson. This brotherhood of the platoon is also illustrated in their reaction to the death of Hearn in comparison to the death of Roth. When Hearn, who was new to the platoon as the commander, was killed by Japanese soldiers, the platoon stood shocked for a couple of seconds and then tried to escape the fire of the Japanese. When Roth died however, \"the platoon was shattered. For ten minuted they huddled together on the shelf, too stricken, too terrified, to move on.<ref name=\":0\" />\"{{rp|684}} Roth had been with the platoon since the beginning and his death greatly effected all of the men, demonstrating the brotherhood they had with Roth and with each other.\n\n'''Loneliness:''' The theme of loneliness also reoccurs within the novel. Away from their family and friends at home, the soldiers are constantly lonely. The men in their ranks are of different social classes and religions, which sometimes makes it difficult for the men to find commonalities between one another. When they do share something in common, they see it as a unifying factor between them. For instance, Goldstein feels a connection and a sort of alliance with Roth since they are both Jewish. Although the men in the platoon do have a sense of brotherhood with one another, as mentioned above, they still feel alone during their deployment. Throughout the novel, the men also long for women and deeper friendships. Roth, for example, wishes to have someone whom he \u201ccould talk to seriously.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|51}} He realizes that he doesn\u2019t know his own comrades very well, since everyone he met when he initially entered the Army was either killed or reassigned somewhere else. The men also constantly degrade women, however, it is evident the absence of women caused them to feel lonelier and wish they were with them.\n\n'''Death and fear:''' Death and the fear of dying is another theme prevalent in the novel. The men are faced with unexpected deaths, such as Hennessey's, Wilson, Hearn, Roth, and Gallagher\u2019s wife who dies during childbirth. It is clear death surrounds them and their lives could be taken away in any moment. Cummings, having been surrounded by Army deaths the majority of his career, still never warms to the smell of rotting corpses. Red, like the other soldiers, realizes he or one of his comrades could be killed any minute. Even when they grew used to death and saw it as \"large and devastating and meaningless. Men who were killed were nearly men no longer around\", a comrade's death would cause \"the idea of death [to be] fresh and terrifying again\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|123}} This fear of death also had a negative impact on the mental health and sanity of the men. For instance, Red states, \"Goddam Army gets you so you're afraid to turn around\".{{rp|12}} The men began to have a pessimistic view of life believing \"All dead things... everything lives to die\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|228}} This was especially so since \"that's all [soldiers] can ever do in the Army, sit and think\" which caused the thoughts and fears of death to be constant and prevalent.<ref name=\":0\" /> {{rp|474}}\n\n'''Power:''' The theme of power is also in the novel through the power relations the men have with one another, especially those of high ranking with those below them. For instance, the theme is exemplified through General Cummings himself. Cummings compares himself to the \u201cchief monk\u201d and God throughout the book. He also openly supports the class system within the military, and states Hearn must accept the \u201cemotional prejudices of his class\u201d, especially since he is an officer. People of higher ranks like Hearn and Cummings, after all, enjoy a better quality of life than the other foot soldiers. They sleep in larger staterooms while the soldiers share small rooms and are jammed into cots. This power system and power relations is reinforced within the missions. After Hearn dies, Croft is \"relieved\" that there is no longer a rival to his power and takes over leading the platoon up the mountain.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|603}} While the other soldiers clearly want to stop and give up, they continue hiking the mountain simply because Croft commands them to. Chickenshit, as termed by [[Paul Fussell]] in \"Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War\", was a major aspect of the theme of power in the novel.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1991|title=Paul Fussell. <italic>Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War</italic>. New York: Oxford University Press. 1989. Pp. x, 330. $19.95|journal=The American Historical Review|doi=10.1086/ahr/96.3.843-a|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> This is shown in how Cummings makes Hearn do humiliating tasks and in the end sends him on a mission knowing he will die, which is the ultimate chickenshit since he sent him to die solely to demonstrate his power. This is another instance where the undemocratic nature of the Army is apparent.\n\n'''Homosexuality:''' The theme of homosexuality is most evident with Cummings. In his \"Time Machine\", Mailer illustrates Cummings growing up experiencing gender-role confusion. Although his mother supports Cummings' identity, his father refuses to have a son who is homosexual and thus sends him to military school. This portages the notion of the Army being only for \"real men\". However, there were a lot of homosexual men who were soldiers during WWII and as [[Allan B\u00e9rub\u00e9]] illustrates in ''Coming Out Under Fire: History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two'', they were often seen as trusted and respected soldiers and medics.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1991|title=Allan Berube. <italic>Coming Out under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two</italic>. New York: Free Press. 1990. Pp. xiii, 377. $22.95|journal=The American Historical Review|doi=10.1086/ahr/96.3.845|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> While in the Army, it is clear Cummings developed romantic feelings towards Hearn and sexually desired him. Through Cummings, Mailer illustrates his beliefs of homosexuality. Although Mailer believes being homosexual is evil, it is interesting he had the general be the homosexual character in the novel, especially since he depicts the general as being a powerful figure who is a good leader. Mailer also includes homosexual characters in his other works as well, such as in ''[[The Deer Park]].'' Mailer directly addresses this theme and his beliefs of homosexuality in \"The Homosexual Villain\" stating he saw homosexuals as evil and always depicted them as the villain in his works but realized they were humans.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mailer, Norman.|title=The homosexual villain|oclc=21704456}}</ref>\n\n'''Misogyny:''' The theme of misogyny also occurs within the novel. Like Mailer\u2019s other works, ''The Naked and the Dead'' constantly portrays women as sexual objects who are below men. Many men, especially Brown, fear their wives are cheating on them while they are at war. This only causes them to have more hatred towards women and a deep distrust towards them. Brown tells Stanley that if he finds out his wife cheated on him, he will beat her then throw her out.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|168}} Later, in the Chorus \u201cWomen,\u201d Polack insists that \u201cthere ain\u2019t a fuggin woman is any good\u201d and Brown agrees. Women are especially emphasized within \"Time Machine\" segments. In these segments, the men\u2019s romantic relationships and sexual experiences are described in detail. In many of the \"Time Machines\", such as Martinez's, women are portrayed as simply sexual objects. In Croft's \"Time Machine\", we learn was cheated on by the women he loved which resulted in him being cold and having a hatred towards women. The men seem to disregard the fact that they have cheated several times on their partners but show extreme hatred in the thought of their wives cheating on them. The only character that seems to positively view his wife is Gallagher, who becomes miserable and lost after she dies. This deep hatred for women, however, is a way to mask how strongly these men miss and desire women; they desperately need women for a variety of different reasons.\n\n==Development==\n'''Writing development:''' Before he left for basic training, Mailer was certain that he could write \u201cTHE war novel\u201d based on his experiences as a cook and the experiences of soldiers in World War II.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Beha |title=Does Mailer Matter? The Young Writer and the last literary celebrity |journal=Harper's Magazine |issue=88}}</ref>  After returning home from the war, he moved to France with his first wife, Beatrice, where he studied at the Sorbonne in [[Paris]].  Here, in just 15 months, Mailer wrote his war novel as noted in his introduction to its Fiftieth Anniversary Edition.<ref name=\"martinfrost.ws\">{{cite web|url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/jan2009/norman-mailer.html |title=Frost's Meditations |website=martinfrost.ws |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923062046/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/jan2009/norman-mailer.html |archivedate=September 23, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMailer states his writing inspiration came from the great Russian novelists like [[Leo Tolstoy]]. While writing, Mailer often read \u201cfrom [[Anna Karenina]] most mornings before he commenced his own work.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|7}} Mailer believed Tolstoy enabled him to bring compassion to his pages; Tolstoy taught him that \u201ccompassion is valueless without severity.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|8}} Mailer was convinced he brought this compassion to ''The Naked and the Dead'', and it is what enabled a 25-year-old to write an incredible war novel.\n\nThroughout his writing process, Mailer explained, he \u201cused to write twenty-five pages of first draft a week,\u201d which allowed his novel to flow from page to page.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.odysseyeditions.com/EBooks/Norman-Mailer/The-Naked-and-the-Dead/Author-commentary |title=The Naked and the Dead: Author commentary |first=Norman |last=Mailer |work=odysseyeditions.com |year=2015 |accessdate=12 February 2015 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Mailer felt this novel was the easiest for him to write, as he finished it quickly and passionately. He later stated, \u201cPart of me thought it was possibly the greatest book written since [[War and Peace]].\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xi}}\n\nDespite the author\u2019s self-praise, he acknowledged his writing immaturity within the novel. Mailer insisted \u201cit was sloppily written in many parts (the words came too quickly and too easily) and there was hardly a noun in any sentence that was not holding hands with the nearest and most commonly available adjective.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xi}} However, despite this criticism, Mailer believed the book deserved to be a best seller. It was written with vigor and contained acute descriptiveness which enabled readers to imagine what World War II was really like. Mailer admitted that he still returned to ''The Naked and the Dead'' occasionally and reread passages because they gave him hope \u201cfor all of us.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xiii}}\n\n'''Character that represents Mailer:''' Mailer stated he did not portray himself as one of the characters. However, he mentions the character of Roth is the most similar to himself. He states Roth's experiences within the novel closely resembled his own experiences in WWII, especially in comparison to the other characters. This similarity is also evident in how they are both Jewish but don't necessarily strongly declare being Jewish.\n\n=== \"Fug\" ===\nThe publishers of ''The Naked and the Dead'' prevented Mailer from using the word \"fuck\" in his novel and had to use the [[euphemism]] \"fug\" instead. Mailer's version of a subsequent incident follows:\n               \n<blockquote>The word has been a source of great embarrassment to me over the years because, you know, Tallulah Bankhead's press agent, many years ago, got a story in the papers which went...\"Oh, hello, you're Norman Mailer,\" said Tallulah Bankhead allegedly, \"You're the young man that doesn't know how to spell...\" You know, the four-letter word was indicated with all sorts of asterisks.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lennon |first=Michael |last2=Mailer |first2=Norman |editor-last=Lennon |editor-first=J.

Colin Singleton tells Lindsey Lee Wells he likes to read literary criticism after reading a book.

Mailer believed ''The Naked and the Dead'' to be his most renowned work. It became the first popular novel about World War II and is considered one of the greatest English-language novels.<ref>[[John Bear]], ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992, pp. 31-39</ref> It was later adapted into a [[The Naked and the Dead (film)|film]] in 1958.\n\nIn 1998 the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''The Naked and the Dead'' 51st on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe novel is divided into four parts: Wave, Argil and Mold, Plant and Phantom, and Wake. Within these parts are chorus sections, consisting of play-like dialogue between characters, as well as Time Machine sections, which give brief histories and flashbacks of individual characters\u2019 lives.\n\nThe story takes place on Anopopei, a fictional island somewhere in the South Pacific. American forces are faced with a campaign to drive out the Japanese so that Americans can advance into the Philippines. The novel focuses on the experiences of one platoon.\n\n===Part One, Wave===\nCharacters are introduced as they wait around for orders. A naval bombardment takes place. The men take their places on a boat and are driven to the invasion shore. Here, they fire back and forth at the Japanese.\n\nHennessey becomes so frightened that he soils in his pants. Overcome by panic, he runs out of his foxhole and is killed by shrapnel from a mortar round. Part One concludes with this death, which alarms many of the men, since for many soldiers Hennessey\u2019s death is the first comrade death they witness.\n\n===Part Two, Argil and Mold===\nThe campaign continues. General Cummings has a soft spot for Lieutenant Hearn, the only officer he can relate to intellectually; they have many discussions together. At one point, the platoon takes a Japanese soldier as prisoner. When Gallagher gives the Japanese soldier a cigarette to smoke, the soldier closes his eyes in relaxation. At this moment, Croft shoots and kills him, demonstrating his coldblooded personality.\n\nLater, Gallagher receives word that his wife, Mary, died in childbirth. Although Gallagher\u2019s child survived, he is overcome by immense grief throughout the rest of the novel.\n\n===Part Three, Plant and Phantom===\nHearn is assigned by Cummings to lead the platoon through the jungle and up Mountain Anaka, to find a way to the rear of the enemy. After a clash with the Japanese, Wilson is shot and left behind.\n\nCroft sends men back to get Wilson. Brown, Stanley, Goldstein, and Ridges then carry Wilson back to the beach on a stretcher. The trip takes several days, and Wilson ends up dying. The men eventually lose Wilson\u2019s body in a river.\n\nCroft manipulates Hearn into walking into an ambush, and Hearn is killed, leaving Croft in charge. The men continue hiking up the mountain on Croft\u2019s orders, even though many men view it as a hopeless cause. Later, Roth dies while attempting to make a jump on the mountain\u2019s edge.\n\nTrudging on, the men eventually give up their task of climbing the mountain. They return to the beach where Brown, Stanley, Goldstein, and Ridges have arrived from their mission with Wilson.\n\nThey learn that the battle for the island is almost won. Surprisingly, the ruthless Croft seems to be relieved that he was unable to climb the mountain. At the end of Part Three, the remaining men discuss their future and how it will feel when they return home now that their mission is over.\n\n===Part Four, Wake===\nThis part consists of one short chapter. Cummings reflects on the war. He is disappointed that the victory was too easy (it came as a result of exhaustion of Japanese troops) and that he cannot take the credit, as Major Dalleson, who acted as his deputy for a day, won the battle just by obeying established procedures. Major Dalleson then wonders about the new training program that will take place with new troops the next day.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n*'''Hennessey''' is a newer member of the platoon. He is very cautious with all of his gear and movements so as to not get killed. When they arrive at the beach of Anopopei, he defecates in his pants out of fear during the opening action scene. He has a mental break down and runs down the beach in hopes of getting new pants. He is killed soon after by shrapnel from an exploding mortar shell.\n*'''Woodrow Wilson''' is a large, impoverished white Southerner. He has a happy-go-lucky and generous nature. In his \"Time Machine\" we learn Wilson wakes up married to a woman named Alice after a drunken night at the bar. Their marriage consists of love affairs and money troubles. Later, Wilson suffers a long, agonizing death after being shot in the stomach by the Japanese; Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley try to carry him back to the beach to be saved but he dies on the way there.\n*'''Julio Martinez''' is a Mexican-American from Texas. He is nicknamed Japbait by Croft and made sergeant in General Cummings infantry division. Martinez was terrified, constantly on edge and an introvert throughout the beginning of the novel. He however, gains bravery through battle and is an excellent soldier, especially in terms of getting a scope for the land. He is well trusted by the other men in the platoon. Croft convinces Martinez to lie about a Japanese platoon he saw on a solo scouting mission, which leads to the death of Hearn and to the men hiking to Mount Anaka under Croft's command.\n*'''Sam Croft''' has a large ego and is coldblooded throughout the novel. At one point, he immorally kills a Japanese POW. Later, he squeezes Roth\u2019s baby bird to death as if he is crushing all innocence. He loves war and is Mailer\u2019s version of a psychopath within the novel. He is seen as one of the best soldiers in the platoon and the other men both fear and respect him as a leader. In his time capsule, we learned he was cheated on by the women he loved which led to him being cold and developing a love for war. At the conclusion of the book, Croft refuses to look forward to his homecoming, believing that the war will continue for much longer. After all, he enjoys the war because he finds a thrill in killing.\n*'''Red Valsen''' claims he does not want to rise in the ranks. He appears numb to death and the war itself. As a child, he grew up in a mine town in Montana. Later, he runs away from home, losing contact with his entire family. After holding many jobs, Red moves in with his girlfriend Lois and her son. Afraid of commitment, Red joins the Army and runs away from Lois. While in the Army, Red loses contact with Lois just like he did with his own family.\n*'''Lieutenant Robert Hearn''' is the stereotypical white liberal. Harvard educated and from an affluent family, Hearn is General Cummings\u2019 assistant. He despises the caste system within the Army, wishing that he could reach out to the lower class foot soldiers. Later, Cummings transfers Hearn to Dalleson\u2019s section. He leads the platoon through the jungle and to the mountain pass. Here, he is shot and killed quickly and anticlimactically not expecting Japanese resistance after Croft keeps the information from him.\n*'''General Edward Cummings''' is power-hungry, often comparing himself to God. As a child, Cummings experiences gender-role confusion. This forces his father to send him to military school. Later, Cummings attends West Point. While at West Point, he meets Margaret and feels socially pressured into marrying her. Margaret and Cummings are married and never have children. They have an unhappy marriage, perhaps due to Cummings homosexual tendencies and feelings. It is apparent through his conversations with Hearn that he has romantic feelings for him.\n*'''Roy Gallagher''' is Boston Irish and part of an Anti-Semitic gang called Christians United. He always seems angry throughout the novel. Later, he learns that his wife Mary died in childbirth, but their baby lived. Gallagher remains devastated for the rest of the novel.\n*'''Roth''' is a depressing, fickle stereotypical representation of a Jew. He, however, refuses to consider himself and strongly associate with being Jewish. Throughout the novel, he has a superiority complex because he is better educated than the other men of the platoon. Roth dies while climbing the mountain because he misses a jump and fails to grasp Gallagher\u2019s hand.\n*'''Joey Goldstein''' is also Jewish like Roth. However, unlike Roth, he does not view himself as better than his Christian friends. Goldstein grows up as a mamma\u2019s boy and desires to own his own shop. Later, he becomes a welder and marries Natalie, despite his mother\u2019s disapproval. After their son is born, Goldstein struggles to support his family and maintain a loving relationship with his wife. Throughout the war, Goldstein is well-respected by his comrades, although he does lack courage at times.\n*'''William Brown''' is the stereotypical well-liked, neighborhood boy. Growing up in a middle-class family, Brown later attends a state university. Here he joins a fraternity and flunks out by freshman year. He marries a girl from his high school, Beverly, and lives a fairly boring life. Throughout the war, he worries that Beverly will cheat on him while he\u2019s away. He is certain that he will throw her out of the house when he returns home.\n*'''Stanley''' insists that women are no different from men. He trusts his wife Ruthie, who is the mother of his child. In some ways, he is the quiet feminist within the novel. He is also more ambitious than the other soldiers, since he is inexperienced in war; he desires to move up in ranks and befriends Brown in order to do so. \n*'''Toglio''' is an Italian-American. Patriotic, trusting, and good-natured, he is friends with most of his platoon. He sustains a [[million-dollar wound]] during combat and is sent home. Subsequently, as time passes, some characters come to envy his wound and grow to hate him.\n*'''Casimir \"Polack\" Czienwicz''' comes from a lower-class Polish family. He grows up with seven siblings and, after his father dies, he enters the orphanage. At thirteen, an older woman seduces him multiple times. These experiences make Polack a tough, courageous soldier in the Army.\n*'''Oscar Ridges''' is extremely Christian. He assures Wyman, who refers to him as \u201cthe preacher,\u201d  that \u201cThe Lord\u2019ll keep me from shooting a Christian\u201d.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|218}} Despite his Christian beliefs, Ridges befriends Goldstein as his buddy. This friendship between a Jew and Christian demonstrates how the war brought men of different backgrounds together.\n*'''Buddy Wyman''' does not play a major role within the novel.  He dreams of becoming a war hero in order to support his mother and himself.\n*'''Steven Minetta''' is twenty years old and was known as the \u201cbest dresser on the block\u201d when he was growing up.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|60}} He is eventually wounded but then returns to the platoon. At the conclusion of the novel, Minetta feels anger towards power figures and hopes to \u201cexpose the goddam Army.\u201d {{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|711}}\n*'''Dalleson''' was second in command to Cummings. He was very nervous throughout the novel and did not trust his own judgment. At the end of the novel, however, it is Dalleson who helps them win the war against the Japanese Army.\n\n==Themes==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nThroughout the novel, Mailer dwells on many themes. These themes are recurring throughout his works and reappear in several of his later essays and novels.\n\n'''Dehumanization of soldiers''' Commenting on the dehumanization of soldiers in ''The Naked and the Dead,'' he said, \"The book finds man corrupted, confused to the point of helplessness, but it also find that there are limits beyond which he cannot be pushed.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Shuster |location=New York |page=97}}</ref> The soldiers are continuously referred to as machines within the novel. At one point, the narrator describes this dehumanization stating, \u201cWhen a man was harnessed into a pack and web belt and carried a rifle and two bandoliers and several grenades, a bayonet and a helmet, he felt as if he had a tourniquet over both shoulders and across his chest. It was hard to breathe and his limbs kept falling asleep.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|24}} Thus, in this instance, the soldier is losing grasp of his bodily functions and simply going through the motions of being a \u201csoldier\u201d. \nDehumanization of the soldier is also seen in chapter 5 when the platoon had to carry antitank guns between 1st Battalion and A Company, which was about a mile of muddy trail. The men became numb and only went through the motions of carrying the guns. The generals disregarded the soldiers' exhaustion. This treatment of men as machines is reinforced throughout the novel. The expectation for the soldiers to fight off Japanese attacks despite their fear also demonstrates this dehumanization. The soldiers generally believed the army didn't see them as people and that \"they don't care if you live or die here [the infirmary]. All they want is to get you back where you can stop a bullet\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|chapter=The Naked and the Dead and Its Aftermath|pages=14\u201333|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctv6sj74q.5|isbn=978-1-61117-806-7|title=Understanding Norman Mailer|year=2017}}</ref>{{rp|354}} Meaning, when soldiers were injured, the Army didn't care about their well-being annd only cared that they would heal enough to go back out into warfare.\n\n'''Brotherhood:''' Another theme, brotherhood, is a positive feature in the novel. In feeling that they may not make it out alive, the soldiers developed strong friendships which are not relatable to people at home. Croft expresses his feelings of brotherhood and tells his comrades, \u201cYou\u2019re all good guys. You\u2019re all chicken, and you\u2019re all yellow, but you\u2019re good guys. They ain\u2019t a goddam thing wrong with you.\u201d, which is important to note considering Croft was the coldhearted character in the novel.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|202}} This idea of brotherhood is also seen within Part III when Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley attempt to carry the wounded Wilson back to camp. Despite the physical strains of carrying Wilson back, the men presisted wanting to save Wilson. This brotherhood of the platoon is also illustrated in their reaction to the death of Hearn in comparison to the death of Roth. When Hearn, who was new to the platoon as the commander, was killed by Japanese soldiers, the platoon stood shocked for a couple of seconds and then tried to escape the fire of the Japanese. When Roth died however, \"the platoon was shattered. For ten minuted they huddled together on the shelf, too stricken, too terrified, to move on.<ref name=\":0\" />\"{{rp|684}} Roth had been with the platoon since the beginning and his death greatly effected all of the men, demonstrating the brotherhood they had with Roth and with each other.\n\n'''Loneliness:''' The theme of loneliness also reoccurs within the novel. Away from their family and friends at home, the soldiers are constantly lonely. The men in their ranks are of different social classes and religions, which sometimes makes it difficult for the men to find commonalities between one another. When they do share something in common, they see it as a unifying factor between them. For instance, Goldstein feels a connection and a sort of alliance with Roth since they are both Jewish. Although the men in the platoon do have a sense of brotherhood with one another, as mentioned above, they still feel alone during their deployment. Throughout the novel, the men also long for women and deeper friendships. Roth, for example, wishes to have someone whom he \u201ccould talk to seriously.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|51}} He realizes that he doesn\u2019t know his own comrades very well, since everyone he met when he initially entered the Army was either killed or reassigned somewhere else. The men also constantly degrade women, however, it is evident the absence of women caused them to feel lonelier and wish they were with them.\n\n'''Death and fear:''' Death and the fear of dying is another theme prevalent in the novel. The men are faced with unexpected deaths, such as Hennessey's, Wilson, Hearn, Roth, and Gallagher\u2019s wife who dies during childbirth. It is clear death surrounds them and their lives could be taken away in any moment. Cummings, having been surrounded by Army deaths the majority of his career, still never warms to the smell of rotting corpses. Red, like the other soldiers, realizes he or one of his comrades could be killed any minute. Even when they grew used to death and saw it as \"large and devastating and meaningless. Men who were killed were nearly men no longer around\", a comrade's death would cause \"the idea of death [to be] fresh and terrifying again\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|123}} This fear of death also had a negative impact on the mental health and sanity of the men. For instance, Red states, \"Goddam Army gets you so you're afraid to turn around\".{{rp|12}} The men began to have a pessimistic view of life believing \"All dead things... everything lives to die\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|228}} This was especially so since \"that's all [soldiers] can ever do in the Army, sit and think\" which caused the thoughts and fears of death to be constant and prevalent.<ref name=\":0\" /> {{rp|474}}\n\n'''Power:''' The theme of power is also in the novel through the power relations the men have with one another, especially those of high ranking with those below them. For instance, the theme is exemplified through General Cummings himself. Cummings compares himself to the \u201cchief monk\u201d and God throughout the book. He also openly supports the class system within the military, and states Hearn must accept the \u201cemotional prejudices of his class\u201d, especially since he is an officer. People of higher ranks like Hearn and Cummings, after all, enjoy a better quality of life than the other foot soldiers. They sleep in larger staterooms while the soldiers share small rooms and are jammed into cots. This power system and power relations is reinforced within the missions. After Hearn dies, Croft is \"relieved\" that there is no longer a rival to his power and takes over leading the platoon up the mountain.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|603}} While the other soldiers clearly want to stop and give up, they continue hiking the mountain simply because Croft commands them to. Chickenshit, as termed by [[Paul Fussell]] in \"Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War\", was a major aspect of the theme of power in the novel.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1991|title=Paul Fussell. <italic>Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War</italic>. New York: Oxford University Press. 1989. Pp. x, 330. $19.95|journal=The American Historical Review|doi=10.1086/ahr/96.3.843-a|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> This is shown in how Cummings makes Hearn do humiliating tasks and in the end sends him on a mission knowing he will die, which is the ultimate chickenshit since he sent him to die solely to demonstrate his power. This is another instance where the undemocratic nature of the Army is apparent.\n\n'''Homosexuality:''' The theme of homosexuality is most evident with Cummings. In his \"Time Machine\", Mailer illustrates Cummings growing up experiencing gender-role confusion. Although his mother supports Cummings' identity, his father refuses to have a son who is homosexual and thus sends him to military school. This portages the notion of the Army being only for \"real men\". However, there were a lot of homosexual men who were soldiers during WWII and as [[Allan B\u00e9rub\u00e9]] illustrates in ''Coming Out Under Fire: History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two'', they were often seen as trusted and respected soldiers and medics.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1991|title=Allan Berube. <italic>Coming Out under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two</italic>. New York: Free Press. 1990. Pp. xiii, 377. $22.95|journal=The American Historical Review|doi=10.1086/ahr/96.3.845|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> While in the Army, it is clear Cummings developed romantic feelings towards Hearn and sexually desired him. Through Cummings, Mailer illustrates his beliefs of homosexuality. Although Mailer believes being homosexual is evil, it is interesting he had the general be the homosexual character in the novel, especially since he depicts the general as being a powerful figure who is a good leader. Mailer also includes homosexual characters in his other works as well, such as in ''[[The Deer Park]].'' Mailer directly addresses this theme and his beliefs of homosexuality in \"The Homosexual Villain\" stating he saw homosexuals as evil and always depicted them as the villain in his works but realized they were humans.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mailer, Norman.|title=The homosexual villain|oclc=21704456}}</ref>\n\n'''Misogyny:''' The theme of misogyny also occurs within the novel. Like Mailer\u2019s other works, ''The Naked and the Dead'' constantly portrays women as sexual objects who are below men. Many men, especially Brown, fear their wives are cheating on them while they are at war. This only causes them to have more hatred towards women and a deep distrust towards them. Brown tells Stanley that if he finds out his wife cheated on him, he will beat her then throw her out.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|168}} Later, in the Chorus \u201cWomen,\u201d Polack insists that \u201cthere ain\u2019t a fuggin woman is any good\u201d and Brown agrees. Women are especially emphasized within \"Time Machine\" segments. In these segments, the men\u2019s romantic relationships and sexual experiences are described in detail. In many of the \"Time Machines\", such as Martinez's, women are portrayed as simply sexual objects. In Croft's \"Time Machine\", we learn was cheated on by the women he loved which resulted in him being cold and having a hatred towards women. The men seem to disregard the fact that they have cheated several times on their partners but show extreme hatred in the thought of their wives cheating on them. The only character that seems to positively view his wife is Gallagher, who becomes miserable and lost after she dies. This deep hatred for women, however, is a way to mask how strongly these men miss and desire women; they desperately need women for a variety of different reasons.\n\n==Development==\n'''Writing development:''' Before he left for basic training, Mailer was certain that he could write \u201cTHE war novel\u201d based on his experiences as a cook and the experiences of soldiers in World War II.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Beha |title=Does Mailer Matter?

Here, in just 15 months, Mailer wrote his war novel as noted in his introduction to its Fiftieth Anniversary Edition.<ref name=\"martinfrost.ws\">{{cite web|url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/jan2009/norman-mailer.html |title=Frost's Meditations |website=martinfrost.ws |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923062046/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/jan2009/norman-mailer.html |archivedate=September 23, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMailer states his writing inspiration came from the great Russian novelists like [[Leo Tolstoy]]. While writing, Mailer often read \u201cfrom [[Anna Karenina]] most mornings before he commenced his own work.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|7}} Mailer believed Tolstoy enabled him to bring compassion to his pages; Tolstoy taught him that \u201ccompassion is valueless without severity.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|8}} Mailer was convinced he brought this compassion to ''The Naked and the Dead'', and it is what enabled a 25-year-old to write an incredible war novel.\n\nThroughout his writing process, Mailer explained, he \u201cused to write twenty-five pages of first draft a week,\u201d which allowed his novel to flow from page to page.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.odysseyeditions.com/EBooks/Norman-Mailer/The-Naked-and-the-Dead/Author-commentary |title=The Naked and the Dead: Author commentary |first=Norman |last=Mailer |work=odysseyeditions.com |year=2015 |accessdate=12 February 2015 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Mailer felt this novel was the easiest for him to write, as he finished it quickly and passionately. He later stated, \u201cPart of me thought it was possibly the greatest book written since [[War and Peace]].\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xi}}\n\nDespite the author\u2019s self-praise, he acknowledged his writing immaturity within the novel. Mailer insisted \u201cit was sloppily written in many parts (the words came too quickly and too easily) and there was hardly a noun in any sentence that was not holding hands with the nearest and most commonly available adjective.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xi}} However, despite this criticism, Mailer believed the book deserved to be a best seller. It was written with vigor and contained acute descriptiveness which enabled readers to imagine what World War II was really like. Mailer admitted that he still returned to ''The Naked and the Dead'' occasionally and reread passages because they gave him hope \u201cfor all of us.\u201d{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xiii}}\n\n'''Character that represents Mailer:''' Mailer stated he did not portray himself as one of the characters. However, he mentions the character of Roth is the most similar to himself. He states Roth's experiences within the novel closely resembled his own experiences in WWII, especially in comparison to the other characters. This similarity is also evident in how they are both Jewish but don't necessarily strongly declare being Jewish.\n\n=== \"Fug\" ===\nThe publishers of ''The Naked and the Dead'' prevented Mailer from using the word \"fuck\" in his novel and had to use the [[euphemism]] \"fug\" instead. Mailer's version of a subsequent incident follows:\n               \n<blockquote>The word has been a source of great embarrassment to me over the years because, you know, Tallulah Bankhead's press agent, many years ago, got a story in the papers which went...\"Oh, hello, you're Norman Mailer,\" said Tallulah Bankhead allegedly, \"You're the young man that doesn't know how to spell...\" You know, the four-letter word was indicated with all sorts of asterisks.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lennon |first=Michael |last2=Mailer |first2=Norman |editor-last=Lennon |editor-first=J.

It is one of two London termini of the [[South Eastern main line]], the other being {{rws|Charing Cross}}, while the Underground station is on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[District line]]s, between [[Bank and Monument stations|Monument]] and [[Mansion House tube station|Mansion House]]. The station runs services by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]], mostly catering for commuters in southeast London and Kent, with occasional services further into the latter.\n\nThe station was built on a site of the medieval [[steelyard]], the trading base in England of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was built by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] in order to have a railway terminal in the City and compete with the rival [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]]. This required a new bridge across the [[River Thames]], which was constructed between 1863 and 1866. The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross, and that route was convenient for travel between the City and the [[West End of London|West End]], until the construction of the [[District Railway]]. It remained popular with commuters, though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century, leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years. The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful, and eventually closed. The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by [[John Poulson]], while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City's 1980s property boom. The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as part of a general renovation of the station to make it more accessible. As part of the [[Thameslink Programme]] development in the 2010s, it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Cannon street railway bridge 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Cannon Street Railway Bridge, 2005]]\nCannon Street is a terminal station, approached across the [[River Thames]] by the Cannon Street Railway Bridge.

The SER had already made plans to extend its line towards {{rws|Charing Cross}}, but decided that it should complement this with a terminus in the City.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=172}}\n\nIn 1861, the company obtained an act for a station in Cannon Street, a short distance from [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and the [[Bank of England]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=172}} In addition to taking traffic from the LC&DR, the new station would provide a direct railway link between the City and the [[West End of London|West End]], over which a journey could be made in a fraction of the time taken travelling by road.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=114}} The approach was a {{convert|60|chain|adj=on}} branch of the line to Charing Cross, west of London Bridge. Work started on the station and its approach in July 1863.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=173}}\n\nThe station was opened on 1 September 1866{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=173}} at a cost of \u00a34 million (now \u00a3{{inflation|UK|4|1866}} million).{{sfn|Ball|Sunderland|2002|p=214}} The original building was designed by [[John Hawkshaw|Sir John Hawkshaw]] and [[John Wolfe-Barry]] and was characterised by its two [[Christopher Wren]]-style towers, {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} square and {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, which faced on to the [[River Thames]]. The towers supported an iron train shed, {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and crowned by a high single arch, almost semicircular, of glass and iron. The station is carried over [[Thames Street, London|Upper Thames Street]] on a brick viaduct, {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and containing 27 million bricks.{{sfn|McCarthy|McCarthy|2009|p=69}} Below this viaduct exist the remains of a number of Roman buildings, which form a [[scheduled ancient monument]].{{sfn|Allinson|Thornton|2014|p=58}} The bridge was open to pedestrians between 1872 and 1877; they paid a toll of [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|\u00bdd]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=173}}\n\n[[File:Cannon Street Station 2.jpg|thumb|left|Original station viewed from the railway bridge, c. 1910]]\nThe five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, was opened in May 1867. It was an [[Italianate]] style hotel and forecourt, designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry|E. M. Barry]], and it provided many of the station's passenger facilities, as well as an appropriate architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement was very similar to that put in place at Charing Cross.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=175}} The hotel was not profitable, and was over \u00a347,000 (now \u00a3{{inflation|UK|47000|1870|fmt=c|r=-3}}) in debt by 1870.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=120}} The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879.{{sfn|Christopher|2015|p=123}} In July 1920, the hotel was the first meeting point of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].

A shuttle service between the two stations ran every 20 minutes and became a popular way of travelling between the City and the West End.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=175}} However, the opening of the [[District Railway]] as far as [[Blackfriars tube station|Blackfriars]] caused traffic to decline, and its extension to [[Mansion House tube station|Mansion House]] the following year reduced it further. The SER's route could not compete with the Underground, which was more direct and reliable,{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=176}} but suburban traffic to Cannon Street remained popular, and the bridge was widened to {{convert|120|ft}} in the late 1880s, allowing ten tracks with sidings. The rebuilt bridge was opened on 13 February 1892.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=177}} The signal boxes outside the station were upgraded the following year.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=124}}\n\nThe [[London and Southwestern Railway]] (LSWR) became interested in using Cannon Street as a terminus, as it would allow a connection between [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]] and the City.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=119}}\n\n===War years===\nWork on strengthening the bridge, by the addition of six new {{convert|443|ft|adj=on}} girders in between the existing ones, was completed in 1913.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=177}}\n\nMost Cannon Street train services ceased during [[World War I]]. Continental boat trains were stopped on 15 November 1914 and rerouted to Victoria. The station stopped being served by through services from Charing Cross on 31 December 1916, and was closed on Sundays. Services were reduced further on 1 May 1918, when it was closed after 3&nbsp;p.m. on Saturdays and between 11&nbsp;a.m. and 4&nbsp;p.m. Mondays to Fridays. This allowed Cannon Street to be used as a goods depot for war supplies.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|pp=177\u2013178}}\n\nBetween 5 and 28 June 1926, the station was closed to allow the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] to carry out various works, including the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of a new system of electrical signalling \u2013 the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains.

In 1874, city financiers who were keen to see the line completed established the Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway (MICCR) to link Mansion House to Aldgate.{{sfn|Brandon|2013|p=58}}{{sfn|Martin|2012|p=64}} Forced into action, the MR bought out the company, and it and the DR began construction of the final section of the Inner Circle in 1879.{{sfn|Brandon|2013|p=58}}\n\nOn 6 October 1884, the final section of the Inner Circle was opened, along with Cannon Street station.{{sfn|Lee|1956|p=47}} Initially, the station was served by trains of both companies as part of the circular Inner Circle service, but various operational patterns have been used during the station's life.{{sfn|Martin|2012|p=65}} The Inner Circle service achieved a separate identity as the Circle line in 1949, although its trains were still provided by the District or Metropolitan lines.{{sfn|Martin|2012|p=66}}\n\nA station here was part of the abandoned phase two expansion of the Fleet line (now [[Jubilee line]]). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=1}} London Transport spent \u00a310m (now \u00a3{{inflation|UK|10|1972}}m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=3-4}}\n\nThe Underground station underwent major reconstruction at the same time as the main line station, with the work being completed in 2012. From 14 December 2014, the station's opening hours changed significantly, with the station opening on Sundays and no longer closing early in the evenings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthbank.org/northbank-news/increased-service-of-district-line-trains-from-14th-dec/|title=Increased Services of District Line Trains from 14 Dec|work=Northbank News|accessdate=19 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404130041/https://www.thenorthbank.org/northbank-news/increased-service-of-district-line-trains-from-14th-dec/|archive-date=4 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The station previously had restricted opening hours because it primarily served the local financial services sector, so there was low demand for services outside office hours.

It is one of two London termini of the [[South Eastern main line]], the other being {{rws|Charing Cross}}, while the Underground station is on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[District line]]s, between [[Bank and Monument stations|Monument]] and [[Mansion House tube station|Mansion House]]. The station runs services by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]], mostly catering for commuters in southeast London and Kent, with occasional services further into the latter.\n\nThe station was built on a site of the medieval [[steelyard]], the trading base in England of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was built by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] in order to have a railway terminal in the City and compete with the rival [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]]. This required a new bridge across the [[River Thames]], which was constructed between 1863 and 1866. The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross, and that route was convenient for travel between the City and the [[West End of London|West End]], until the construction of the [[District Railway]]. It remained popular with commuters, though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century, leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years. The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful, and eventually closed. The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by [[John Poulson]], while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City's 1980s property boom. The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as part of a general renovation of the station to make it more accessible. As part of the [[Thameslink Programme]] development in the 2010s, it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Cannon street railway bridge 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Cannon Street Railway Bridge, 2005]]\nCannon Street is a terminal station, approached across the [[River Thames]] by the Cannon Street Railway Bridge. Its approach by rail is through a triangular connection to both {{LUL stations|station=London Bridge}} and {{stnlnk|Charing Cross}}. It is one of eighteen stations in the country that are managed by [[Network Rail]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Our stations |url=https://www.networkrail.co.uk/communities/passengers/our-stations/ |website=NetworkRail |accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere were originally eight platforms; a refurbishment in the late 1990s removed the original platform 1.{{sfn|Christopher|2015|p=123}} It has entrances on [[Cannon Street]] itself and Dowgate Hill.

The SER had already made plans to extend its line towards {{rws|Charing Cross}}, but decided that it should complement this with a terminus in the City.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=172}}\n\nIn 1861, the company obtained an act for a station in Cannon Street, a short distance from [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and the [[Bank of England]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=172}} In addition to taking traffic from the LC&DR, the new station would provide a direct railway link between the City and the [[West End of London|West End]], over which a journey could be made in a fraction of the time taken travelling by road.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=114}} The approach was a {{convert|60|chain|adj=on}} branch of the line to Charing Cross, west of London Bridge. Work started on the station and its approach in July 1863.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=173}}\n\nThe station was opened on 1 September 1866{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=173}} at a cost of \u00a34 million (now \u00a3{{inflation|UK|4|1866}} million).{{sfn|Ball|Sunderland|2002|p=214}} The original building was designed by [[John Hawkshaw|Sir John Hawkshaw]] and [[John Wolfe-Barry]] and was characterised by its two [[Christopher Wren]]-style towers, {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} square and {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, which faced on to the [[River Thames]]. The towers supported an iron train shed, {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and crowned by a high single arch, almost semicircular, of glass and iron. The station is carried over [[Thames Street, London|Upper Thames Street]] on a brick viaduct, {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and containing 27 million bricks.{{sfn|McCarthy|McCarthy|2009|p=69}} Below this viaduct exist the remains of a number of Roman buildings, which form a [[scheduled ancient monument]].{{sfn|Allinson|Thornton|2014|p=58}} The bridge was open to pedestrians between 1872 and 1877; they paid a toll of [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|\u00bdd]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=173}}\n\n[[File:Cannon Street Station 2.jpg|thumb|left|Original station viewed from the railway bridge, c. 1910]]\nThe five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, was opened in May 1867. It was an [[Italianate]] style hotel and forecourt, designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry|E. M. Barry]], and it provided many of the station's passenger facilities, as well as an appropriate architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement was very similar to that put in place at Charing Cross.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=175}} The hotel was not profitable, and was over \u00a347,000 (now \u00a3{{inflation|UK|47000|1870|fmt=c|r=-3}}) in debt by 1870.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=120}} The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879.{{sfn|Christopher|2015|p=123}} In July 1920, the hotel was the first meeting point of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, but the public rooms were kept open for meetings. The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=175}} The hotel is referred to in The Fire Sermon section of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47311/the-waste-land |title=The Waste Land by T. S.

In 1874, city financiers who were keen to see the line completed established the Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway (MICCR) to link Mansion House to Aldgate.{{sfn|Brandon|2013|p=58}}{{sfn|Martin|2012|p=64}} Forced into action, the MR bought out the company, and it and the DR began construction of the final section of the Inner Circle in 1879.{{sfn|Brandon|2013|p=58}}\n\nOn 6 October 1884, the final section of the Inner Circle was opened, along with Cannon Street station.{{sfn|Lee|1956|p=47}} Initially, the station was served by trains of both companies as part of the circular Inner Circle service, but various operational patterns have been used during the station's life.{{sfn|Martin|2012|p=65}} The Inner Circle service achieved a separate identity as the Circle line in 1949, although its trains were still provided by the District or Metropolitan lines.{{sfn|Martin|2012|p=66}}\n\nA station here was part of the abandoned phase two expansion of the Fleet line (now [[Jubilee line]]). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=1}} London Transport spent \u00a310m (now \u00a3{{inflation|UK|10|1972}}m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.{{sfn|Mitchell|2003|p=3-4}}\n\nThe Underground station underwent major reconstruction at the same time as the main line station, with the work being completed in 2012.

Its population of 583,393 makes it the [[List of cities in Germany by population|ninth largest city of Germany]], as well as the fourth largest city of the federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. On the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Emscher]] rivers, Essen geographically is part of the [[Rhineland]] and the larger [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]]. The [[Ruhrdeutsch]] [[regiolect]] spoken in the region has strong influences of both [[Low German]] ([[Westphalian language|Westphalian]]) and [[Low Franconian]] ([[East Bergish]]).\n\nEssen is seat to several of the region's authorities, as well as to eight of the 100 largest publicly held German corporations regarding turnover, including two [[DAX]] corporations. Essen is often considered the energy capital of Germany with [[E.ON]] and [[RWE]], Germany's largest energy providers, both headquartered in the city. Essen is also known for its impact on the arts through the respected [[Folkwang University of the Arts]], its Zollverein School of Management and Design, and the [[Red Dot]] industrial product design award. In early 2003, the universities of Essen and the nearby city of [[Duisburg]] (both established in 1972) were merged into the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] with campuses in both cities and a [[university hospital]] in Essen. In 1958, Essen was chosen to serve as the seat to a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen|Roman Catholic diocese]] (often referred to as ''Ruhrbistum'' or ''diocese of the Ruhr'').\n\nFounded around 845, Essen remained a small town within the sphere of influence of an important [[Imperial Abbey|ecclesiastical principality]] ([[Essen Abbey]]) until the onset of industrialization. The city then \u2014 especially through the [[Krupp]] family iron works \u2014 became one of Germany's most important coal and steel centers. Essen, until the 1970s, attracted workers from all over the country; it was the 5th-largest city in Germany between 1929 and 1988, peaking at over 730,000 inhabitants in 1962. Following the region-wide decline of heavy industries in the last decades of the 20th century, the city has seen the development of a strong [[tertiary sector of the economy]]. The most notable witness of this ''Strukturwandel'' (structural change) is the [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex]], which has once been the largest of its kind in Europe. Ultimately closed in 1993, both the [[coking plant]] and the [[coal mine|mine]] have been inscribed in the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] since 2001.\n\nNotable accomplishments of the city in recent years include the title of [[European Capital of Culture]] on behalf of the whole Ruhr area in 2010 and the selection as the [[European Green Capital]] for 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/applying-for-the-award/2017-egca-applicant-cities/|title=European Green Capital|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== General ===\n<!-- Please do not change the alignment of the column content since they reflect the geographic positions. -->\n{| style=\"width: 400px; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Oberhausen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Oberhausen]]\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:10%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Bottrop COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Bottrop]]\n| style=\"text-align:left; width:15%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Gladbeck COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Gladbeck]]\n| style=\"text-align:left; width:25%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Gelsenkirchen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Gelsenkirchen]]\n|-\n| style=\"width:25%; text-align:right;\"| [[File:DEU Muelheim an der Ruhr COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[M\u00fclheim|M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr]]\n| style=\"width:50%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| [[File:Essen Stadtteile und Stadtbezirke.svg|100px|center|Map of the Districts and Boroughs of Essen]] Essen<br /><small>(Map of districts and boroughs)</small>\n| style=\"width:25%; text-align:left;\"| [[File:Stadtwappen der kreisfreien Stadt Bochum.svg|20px]]<br />[[Bochum]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Ratingen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Ratingen]]\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Heiligenhaus COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Heiligenhaus]]\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Velbert COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Velbert]]\n| style=\"text-align:left; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Hattingen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Hattingen]]\n|-\n|}\nEssen is located in the centre of the [[Ruhr]] area, one of the largest [[urban area]]s in Europe (see also: [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]]), comprising eleven [[independent city|independent cities]] and four [[district]]s with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Essen itself are {{convert|87|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and border ten cities, five independent and five ''kreisangeh\u00f6rig'' (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 1.4 million. The city extends over {{convert|21|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south and {{convert|17|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from west to east, mainly north of the [[Ruhr (river)|River Ruhr]].\n\nThe Ruhr forms the ''Lake Baldeney'' [[reservoir]] in the boroughs of Fischlaken, Kupferdreh, Heisingen and [[Essen-Werden|Werden]]. The lake, a popular recreational area, dates from 1931 to 1933, when some thousands of unemployed [[coal miner]]s dredged it with primitive tools. Generally, large areas south of the River Ruhr (including the suburbs of Schuir and [[Kettwig]]) are quite green and are often quoted as examples of rural structures in the otherwise relatively densely populated central Ruhr area. According to the [[Federal Statistical Office of Germany]], Essen with 9.2% of its area covered by recreational green is the greenest city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-125300649.html|title=Kommunen: Der Tausendf\u00fc\u00dfler|date=October 2014|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> and the third-greenest city in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/reise-leben/top-ten-das-sind-deutschlands-gruenste-staedte/4369498.html|title=Top ten: Das sind Deutschlands gr\u00fcnste St\u00e4dte|website=www.handelsblatt.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> The city has been shortlisted for the title of [[European Green Capital]] two consecutive times, for 2016 and 2017, winning for 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/media-corner/press-releases/index.html|title=European Green Capital|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> The city was singled out for its exemplary practices in protecting and enhancing nature and biodiversity and efforts to reduce water consumption. Essen participates in a variety of networks and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve the city's resilience in the face of climate change.\n\nThe lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Karnap at {{convert|26.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, the highest point in the borough of Heidhausen at {{convert|202.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The average elevation is {{convert|116|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== City districts ===\n[[File:Essen hbf 1817.jpg|thumb|Main station]]\nEssen comprises fifty boroughs which in turn are grouped into nine suburban districts (called ''[[Stadtbezirk]]e'') often named after the most important boroughs. Each Stadtbezirk is assigned a [[Roman numeral]] and has a local body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1901 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of [[Kettwig]], located south of the Ruhr River, and which was not annexed until 1975, has its own [[Telephone numbering plan|area code]]. Additionally (allegedly due to relatively high church tax incomes), the Archbishop of Cologne managed to keep Kettwig directly subject to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Archdiocese of Cologne]], whereas all other boroughs of Essen and some neighboring cities constitute the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen|Diocese of Essen]]''.''\n\n=== Climate ===\nEssen has a \"true\"''/''typical [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'') with relatively mild winters and cool summers (different of [[Berlin]] or [[Stuttgart]]).

size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions. \nSource:<ref>[https://www.it.nrw/statistik Statistisches Landesamt Nordrhein-Westfalen]</ref>}}\n=== Origin of the name ===\nIn German-speaking countries, the name of the city Essen often causes confusion as to its origins, because it is commonly known as the German [[infinitive]] of the [[German verbs|verb]] for \"eating\" (written as lowercase ''[[wikt:essen|essen]]''), and/or the German [[German nouns|noun]] for [[food]] (which is always [[capitalization|capitalized]] as ''[[wikt:Essen|Essen]]'', adding to the confusion). Although scholars still dispute the interpretation of the name,<ref>{{cite web|author=Stadt Essen |url=https://www.essen.de/rathaus/aemter/ordner_41/stadtarchiv/geschichte/Geschichte_Namensdeutung.de.html |title=Origin of place names|language=German |publisher=Essen.de |date= |accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> there remain a few noteworthy interpretations. The oldest known form of the city's name is ''Astnide'', which changed to Essen by way of forms such as Astnidum, Assinde, Essendia and Esnede. The name Astnide may have referred either to a region where many [[ash tree]]s were found or to a region in the East (of the [[Frankish Empire]]).<ref>Paul Derks: ''Der Ortsname Essen'', in: ''Essener Beitr\u00e4ge'' 103 (1989/90), pp. 27\u201351</ref> The [[Old High German]] word for fireplace, Esse, is also commonly mentioned due to the industrial history of the city, but is highly unlikely since the old forms of the city name originate from times before industrialization.\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe oldest archaeological find, the ''[[Vogelheimer Klinge]]'', dates back to 280,000 \u2013 250,000 BC. It is a [[blade]] found in the borough of {{Interlanguage link multi|Vogelheim|de}} in the northern part of the city during the construction of the [[Rhine\u2013Herne Canal]] in 1926.<ref>[https://media.essen.de/media/wwwessende/aemter/41/stadtarchiv/1_ergrabene_zeit.pdf \"Ergrabene Zeiten\"], City of Essen, undated {{de icon}}</ref> Other artifacts from the [[Stone Age]] have also been found, although these are not overly numerous. Land utilization was very high \u2013 especially due to mining activities during the Industrial Age \u2013 and any more major finds, especially from the [[Mesolithic]] era, are not expected. Finds from 3,000 BC and onwards are far more common, the most important one being a [[Megalith|Megalithic tomb]] found in 1937. Simply called Steinkiste (Chest of Stone), it is referred to as \"Essen's earliest preserved example of architecture\".<ref>Detlef Hopp: ''Essen vor der Geschichte \u2013 Die Arch\u00e4ologie der Stadt bis zum 9. Jahrhundert'', in Borsdorf (Ed.): ''Essen \u2013 Geschichte einer Stadt'', 2002, p. 32</ref>\n\nEssen was part of the settlement areas of several Germanic peoples ([[Chatti]], [[Bructeri]], [[Marsi (Germanic)|Marsi]]), although a clear distinction among these groupings is difficult.\n\nThe Alteburg castle in the south of Essen dates back to the 1st or 2nd century BC, the Herrenburg to the 8th century [[AD]].\n\nRecent research into [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' has identified the ''polis'' or ''[[oppidum]]'' [[Navalia]] as Essen.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/mapping-ancient-germania-berlin-researchers-crack-the-ptolemy-code-a-720513.html \"Mapping Ancient Germania: Berlin Researchers Crack the Ptolemy Code\"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]''</ref>\n\n=== 8th\u201312th centuries ===\n[[File:Essen 2011 66-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Essen Minster]]]]\nAround 845, Saint [[Altfrid]] (around 800\u2013874), the later [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|Bishop of Hildesheim]], founded an abbey for women (''coenobium Astnide'') in the centre of present-day Essen. The first abbess was Altfrid's relative Gerswit (see also: [[Essen Abbey]]). In 799, [[Liudger|Saint Liudger]] had already founded [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] [[Werden Abbey]] on its own grounds a few kilometers south. The region was sparsely populated with only a few [[smallholding]]s and an old and probably abandoned castle. Whereas Werden Abbey sought to support Liudger's missionary work in the [[Harz]] region ([[Helmstedt]]/[[Halberstadt]]), Essen Abbey was meant to care for women of the higher [[Saxons|Saxon]] nobility. This abbey was not an abbey in the ordinary sense, but rather intended as a residence and educational institution for the daughters and widows of the higher nobility; led by an abbess, the members other than the abbess herself were not obliged to take vows of [[chastity]].\n\nAround 852, construction of the collegiate church of the abbey began, to be completed in 870. A major fire in 946 heavily damaged both the church and the settlement. The church was rebuilt, expanded considerably, and is the foundation of the present Essen Cathedral.\n\nThe first documented mention of Essen dates back to 898, when [[Zwentibold]], King of [[Lotharingia]], willed territory on the western bank of the [[Rhine|River Rhine]] to the abbey. Another document, describing the foundation of the abbey and allegedly dating back to 870, is now considered an 11th-century forgery.\n\nIn 971, [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen|Mathilde II]], granddaughter of Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], took charge of the abbey. She was to become the most important of all abbesses in the history of Essen. She reigned for over 40 years, and endowed the abbey's treasury with invaluable objects such as the oldest preserved seven branched candelabrum, and the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]], the oldest known [[Madonna (art)|sculpture of the Virgin Mary]] in the western world. Mathilde was succeeded by other women related to the [[Ottonian]] emperors: Sophia, daughter of [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] and sister of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], and Teophanu, granddaughter of Otto II. It was under the reign of Teophanu that Essen, which had been called a city since 1003, received the right to hold markets in 1041. Ten years later, Teophanu had the eastern part of Essen Abbey constructed. Its [[crypt]] contains the tombs of St. Altfrid, Mathilde II, and Teophanu herself.\n\n=== 13th\u201317th centuries ===\n[[File:Altessen, Weltladen Alte Kirche foto3 2012-08-19 12.43.jpg|thumb|upright|Alte Kirche (Old Church, built 1887), Altenessen]]\nIn 1216, the abbey, which had only been an important landowner until then, gained the status of a princely residence when Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] called abbess Elisabeth I ''Reichsf\u00fcrstin'' (''Princess of the Empire'') in an official letter. In 1244, 28 years later, Essen received its town charter and seal when [[Konrad von Hochstaden]], the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], marched into the city and erected a city wall together with the population. This proved a temporary emancipation of the population of the city from the princess-abbesses, but this lasted only until 1290. That year, King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]] restored the princess-abbesses to full sovereignty over the city, much to the dismay of the population of the growing city, who called for self-administration and [[imperial immediacy]]. The title [[free imperial city]] was finally granted by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1377. However, in 1372, Charles had paradoxically endorsed Rudolph I's 1290 decision and hence left both the abbey and the city in imperial favour. Disputes between the city and the abbey about supremacy over the region remained common until the abbey's dissolution in 1803. Many lawsuits were filed at the [[Reichskammergericht]], one of them lasting almost 200 years. The final decision of the court in 1670 was that the city had to be \"duly obedient in dos and don'ts\" to the abbesses but could maintain its old rights\u2014a decision that did not really solve any of the problems.\n\nIn 1563, the city council, with its self-conception as the only legitimate ruler of Essen, introduced the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The Catholic abbey had no troops to counter this development.\n\n=== Thirty Years' War ===\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Protestant city and the Catholic abbey opposed each other. In 1623, princess-abbess Maria Clara von Spaur, Pflaum und Val\u00f6r, managed to direct Catholic Spaniards against the city in order to initiate a [[Counter-Reformation]]. In 1624, a \"re-Catholicization\" law was enacted, and churchgoing was strictly controlled. In 1628, the city council filed against this at the Reichskammergericht. Maria had to flee to Cologne when the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] stormed the city in 1629. She returned in the summer of 1631 following the [[Bavarians]] under [[Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim]], only to leave again in September. She died 1644 in Cologne.\n\nThe war proved a severe blow to the city, with frequent arrests, kidnapping and rape. Even after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] from 1648, troops remained in the city until 9 September 1650.\n\n=== Industrialisation ===\n\n[[File:Drei Ringe von Krupp.jpg|thumb|upright|The three rings of Krupp]]\n[[File:Essen, Stammhaus Krupp, 2014-11 CN-02.jpg|thumb|Historic House of the Krupp Family]]\n\nThe first historic evidence of the important mining tradition of Essen date back to the 14th century, when the princess-abbess was granted mining rights. The first silver mine opened in 1354, but the indisputably more important coal was not mentioned until 1371, and coal mining only began in 1450.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century, many coal mines had opened in Essen, and the city earned a name as a centre of the weapons industry. Around 1570, [[gunsmith]]s made high profits and in 1620, they produced 14,000 rifles and pistols a year. The city became increasingly important strategically.\n\nResident in Essen since the 16th century, the Krupp family dynasty and Essen shaped each other. In 1811, [[Friedrich Krupp]] founded Germany's first cast-steel factory in Essen and laid the cornerstone for what was to be the largest enterprise in Europe for a couple of decades. The weapon factories in Essen became so important that a sign facing the [[Essen Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] welcomed visitor [[Benito Mussolini]] to the \"Armory of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]]\" in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrw2000.de/ns/hitler_mussolini.htm|title=NRW 2000 \u2013 Epoche des Nationalsozialismus \u2013 Einleitung \u2013 Hitler und Mussolini besuchen die \"Waffenschmiede des Reiches\" und die Krupp-Werke Essen|publisher=Nrw2000.de|date=25 September 1937|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112925/http://www.nrw2000.de/ns/hitler_mussolini.htm|archivedate=16 July 2011}}</ref> The Krupp Works also were the main reason for the [[:de:Bild:Essen Bevoelkerungsentwicklung 01 KMJ.png|large population growth]] beginning in the mid-19th century. Essen reached a population of 100,000 in 1896. Other industrialists, such as Friedrich Grillo, who in 1892 donated the [[Grillo-Theater]] to the city, also played a major role in the shaping of the city and the [[Ruhr]] area in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\n=== First World War ===\nRiots broke out in February 1917 following a breakdown in the supply of flour. There were then strikes in the Krupp factory.<ref>\"{{Lang|de|Auszug aus der Zusammenstellung der Monatsberichte der stellv.

The French Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On the morning of 31 March 1923 it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.<ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/1157/her_mit_der_kohle.html Her mit der Kohle \u2013 ''Der Spiegel'' EinesTages; retrieved on 4.

Between the early 15th and 20th centuries, the political system of Essen underwent several changes, most importantly the introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1563, the [[annexation]] of 1802 by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and the subsequent [[secularization]] of the principality in 1803. The territory was made part of the Prussian [[Province of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]] from 1815 to 1822, after which it became part of the Prussian [[Rhine Province]] until its dissolution in 1946.\n\nDuring the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], Essen was the home of the Essen Tendency (Essener Richtung) within the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany]]. In 1922 they founded the [[Communist Workers' International]]. Essen became one of the centres of resistance to [[Social Democracy]] and the [[Freikorps]] alike.\n\nDuring the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the [[Nazi Party]]. After [[World War II]], the military government of the [[British occupation zone]] installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. Later, the city council was again elected by the population. The mayor was elected by the council as its head and as the city's main [[Representation (politics)|representative]]. The [[Executive (government)|administration]] was led by a full-time ''Oberstadtdirektor''. In 1999, the position of Oberstadtdirektor was abolished in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and the mayor became both main representative and administrative head. In addition, the population now elects the mayor directly.\n\n=== City council ===\nThe last local elections took place on 27 September 2015.

Granted in 1886, it is a so-called ''Allianzwappen'' ([[arms of alliance]]) and consists of two separate shields under a single crown. Most other coats of arms of cities show a wall instead of a crown. The crown, however, does not refer to the city of Essen itself, but instead to the [[German Mediatisation|secularized]] [[Principality|ecclesiastical principality]] of [[Essen Abbey|Essen]] under the reign of the princess-abbesses. The dexter (heraldically right) [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] shows the double-headed Imperial Eagle of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], granted to the city in 1623. The sinister (heraldically left) escutcheon is one of the oldest emblems of Essen and shows a sword that people believed was used to behead the city's [[patron saint|patron]] [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]]. People tend to connect the sword in the left shield with one found in the Cathedral Treasury. This sword, however, is much more recent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regesta-imperii.adwmainz.de/regesten/regshow.php?pk=8837&offset=0&bandanzeige=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311161524/http://regesta-imperii.adwmainz.de/regesten/regshow.php?pk=8837&offset=0&bandanzeige=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 March 2007|title=Origin of the sword in the Essen Cathedral Treasury|publisher=Regesta-imperii.adwmainz.de|accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> A slightly modified and more heraldically correct version of the coat of arms can be found on the roof of the ''Handelshof'' hotel near the main station.\n[[File:Hotel Handelshof Essen.jpg|thumb|The Handelshof Hotel with modified coat of arms and unofficial motto]]\n\n=== International relations ===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\nEssen is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.essen.de/rathaus/europa/foerderprogramme/europa_fuer_buergerinnen_und_buerger.de.html |title=Politikfeld B\u00fcrgerbegegnungen und St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften: St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften |publisher=Presse- und Kommunikationsamt, Oberb\u00fcrgermeister, Stadt Essen |type=official website |website=Essen.de |language=German |accessdate=2014-11-17}}</ref>\n* [[Grenoble]], France <small>''(since 1974)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=J\u00e9r\u00f4me Steffenino, Marguerite Masson |url=http://www.grenoble.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page_id=92 |title=Ville de Grenoble \u2013 Coop\u00e9rations et villes jumelles |publisher=Grenoble.fr |date= |accessdate=29 October 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014074034/http://www.grenoble.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page_id=92|archivedate=14 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=J\u00e9r\u00f4me Steffenino, Marguerite Masson |url=http://www.grenoble.fr/103-jumelages-et-cooperations.htm|title=Ville de Grenoble \u2013Coop\u00e9rations et villes jumelles |publisher=Grenoble.fr |date= |accessdate=16 May 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Nizhny Novgorod]], Russia <small>''(since 1991)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[City of Sunderland]], United Kingdom <small>''(since 1949)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Tampere]], Finland <small>''(since 1960)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Tel Aviv]], Israel <small>''(since 1991)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\nThe [[Monessen, Pennsylvania|City of Monessen, Pennsylvania]], situated along the [[Monongahela River]], was named after the river and Essen.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harvath |first=Les |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_497856.html |title=School colors glimpse history|work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|date=18 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202044754/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_497856.html|archive-date=2010-02-02|access-date=2017-02-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere are cooperations with the following cities:<ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\"/>\n\n* [[Erfurt]], Germany <small>''(since 1991)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Zabrze]], Poland <small>''(since 2008)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Qingdao|Quingdao]], China <small>''(since 2008)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n\n== Industry and infrastructure ==\n\n=== Economy ===\nEssen is home to several large companies, among them the [[ThyssenKrupp]] industrial conglomerate which is also registered in [[Duisburg]] and originates from a 1999 merger between Duisburg-based ''Thyssen AG'' and Essen-based [[Krupp|Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp]].

Each day, it produces a 30-minute regional evening news magazine (called ''Lokalzeit Ruhr''), a 5-minute afternoon news programme, and several radio news programmes. A local broadcasting station went on air in the late 1990s. The [[WAZ-Mediengruppe|WAZ Media Group]] is one of the most important (print) media companies in Europe and publishes the Ruhr area's two most important daily newspapers, ''[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' (WAZ; 580,000 copies) and ''Neue Ruhr/Rhein Zeitung'' (NRZ; 180,000 copies). In Essen, the WAZ Group also publishes the local ''Borbecker Nachrichten'' (at times Germany's largest local newspaper){{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} and ''Werdener Nachrichten'', both of which had been independent weekly newspapers for parts of Essen.

Other fields include [[nanotechnology]], [[discrete mathematics]] and \"education in the 21st century\". Another university in Essen is the private ''[[Fachhochschule]] f\u00fcr \u00d6konomie und Management'', a university of applied sciences with over 6,000 students and branches in 15 other major cities throughout Germany.\n\n=== Medicine ===\nEssen offers a highly diversified health care system with more than 1,350 resident doctors and almost 6,000 beds in 13 hospitals, including a university hospital. The university hospital dates back to 1909, when the city council established a municipal hospital; although it was largely destroyed during [[World War II]], it was later rebuilt, and finally gained the title of a university hospital in 1963. It focuses on [[List of ICD-9 codes 390-459: Diseases of the circulatory system#7. Diseases of the circulatory system (390\u2013459)|diseases of the circulatory system]] (West German Heart Centre Essen), [[oncology]] and [[organ transplant|transplantation medicine]], with the department of [[bone marrow transplant]]ation being the second-largest of its kind in the world.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nElisabethkrankenhaus Essen.jpg|Elisabethkrankenhaus Essen\nUniklinik Essen, 20071222.jpg|University Hospital Essen\n</gallery>\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n==== Streets and motorways ====\n[[File:A40-Ruhrschnellweg-Huttrop.jpg|thumb|[[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] facing towards the [[central business district]] of Essen]]\nThe road network of Essen consists of over 3,200 streets, which in total have a length of roughly {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThree ''[[German Autobahnen|Autobahnen]]'' touch Essen territory, most importantly the [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] (Ruhr expressway, A 40), which runs directly through the city, dividing it roughly in half. In a west-eastern direction, the A 40 connects the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Venlo]] with Dortmund, running through the whole [[Ruhr]] area. It is one of the arterial roads of the Ruhr area (> 140,000 vehicles/day) and suffers from heavy congestion during rush hours, which is why many people in the area nicknamed it ''Ruhrschleichweg'' (Ruhr crawling way). A tunnel was built in the 1970s, when the then-[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]] was upgraded to [[Autobahn|motorway]] standards, so that the A 40 is hidden from public view in the inner-city district near the [[Essen Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]].\n\nIn the north, the [[Bundesautobahn 42|A 42]] briefly touches Essen territory, serving as an interconnection between the neighboring cities of [[Oberhausen]] and [[Gelsenkirchen]] and destinations beyond.\n\nA segment of the [[Bundesautobahn 52|A 52]] connects Essen with the more southern region around [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. On Essen territory, the A 52 runs from the southern boroughs near [[M\u00fclheim|M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr]] past the fairground and then merges with the [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] at the [[Autobahndreieck]] Essen-Ost junction east of the city centre.\n\nWith the A 40/A 52 in the southern parts of the city and the A 42 in the north, there is a gap in the motorway system often leading to congestion on streets leading from the central to the northern boroughs. An extension of the A 52 to connect the Essen-Ost junction with the A 42 to close this gap is considered urgent;<ref>Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2003, p. 124</ref> it has been planned for years but not yet been realized \u2013 most importantly due to the high-density areas this extension would lead through, resulting in high costs and concerns with the citizens.\n\n==== Public transport ====\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the [[DB Regio]] subsidiary of [[Deutsche Bahn]] for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Ruhrbahn, is a member of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]] (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's [[railway line]]s (except the high-speed [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of Ruhrbahn, all other members of VRR, and DB.\n\n{{As of|2009}}, Ruhrbahn operates 3 U-[[Stadtbahn]] lines of the [[Essen Stadtbahn]] network, 7 [[Trams in Essen|Stra\u00dfenbahn (tram)]] lines and 57 bus lines (16 of these serving as ''Nacht Express'' late-night lines only).

The U-Stadtbahn, which partly runs on used [[Docklands Light Railway]] stock, is a mixture of tram and full [[rapid transit|underground]] systems with 20 underground stations for the U-Stadtbahn and additional 4 underground stations used by the tram. Two lines of the U-Stadtbahn are completely intersection-free and hence independent from other traffic, and the U18 line leading from M\u00fclheim main station to the ''Bismarckplatz'' station at the gates of the city centre partly runs above ground amidst the [[Bundesautobahn 40|A 40 motorway]].

While the first flights had already arrived in 1919, it was officially opened on 25 August 1925. Significantly expanded in 1935, Essen/M\u00fclheim became the central airport of the Ruhr area until the end of the [[Second World War]], providing an [[asphalt]]ed runway of {{convert|1553|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, another unsurfaced runway for [[gliding]] and destinations to most major [[Europe]]an cities. It was heavily damaged during the war, yet partly reconstructed and used by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as a secondary airport since visibility is less often [[fog|obscured]] than at [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]]. The latter then developed into the large civil airport that it is now, while Essen/M\u00fclheim now mainly serves occasional air traffic (some 33,000 passengers each year),<ref>According to ''RVV-Verkehrsstatistik 2007'' (''RVV'' Traffic Statistics 2007).</ref> the base of a fleet of [[airships]] and Germany's oldest public [[flight training]] company.

For decades, the coal mine (current form mainly from 1932, closed in 1986) and the coking plant (closed in 1993) ranked among the largest of their kinds in Europe. Shaft XII, built in [[Bauhaus]] style, with its characteristic winding tower, which over the years has become a symbol for the whole [[Ruhr]] area, is considered an architectural and technical masterpiece, earning it a reputation as the \"most beautiful coal mine in the world\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.erih.net/index.php?anchor=66&pageId=40 |title=European Route of Industrial Heritage |publisher=En.erih.net |accessdate=6 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211954/http://en.erih.net/index.php?anchor=66&pageId=40 |archivedate=5 February 2012 }}</ref> After [[UNESCO]] had declared it a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2001, the complex, which had lain idle for a long time and was even threatened to be demolished, began to see a period of redevelopment. Under the direction of an agency borne by the land of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and the city itself, several arts and design institutions settled mainly on the grounds of the former coal mine; a redevelopment plan for the coking plant is to be realised.\n\nOn the grounds of the coal mine and the coking plant, which are both accessible free of charge while paid guided tours (some with former {{lang|de|[[miner|Kumpels]]}}) are available, several tourist attractions can be found, most importantly the ''Design Zentrum NRW''/[[Red Dot|Red Dot Design Museum]]. The ''Ruhrmuseum'', a museum dedicated to the history of the Ruhr area, which had been existing since 1904, opened its gates as one of the anchor attractions in the former coal-washing facility in 2010.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nFile:Zeche Zollverein Essen Okt10 011.jpg|Coal mine Zollverein\nFile:Zeche Zollverein abends.jpg|Shaft XII of Zollverein\nFile:Essen - Zeche-Zollverein - Eingangstor - 2013.jpg|Zollverein entrance\nFile:Rolltreppe Ruhrmuseum.jpg|Ruhrmuseum\nFile:Ruhrmuseum Staircase.jpg|Ruhrmuseum staircase\n</gallery>\n\n=== Essen Minster and treasury ===\nThe former collegiate church of [[Essen Abbey]] and nowadays cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen|Bishop of Essen]] is a [[Gothic art|Gothic]] hall church made from light [[sandstone]]. The first church on the premises dates back to between 845 and 870; the current church was constructed after a former church had burnt down in 1275. However, the important [[westwork]] and [[crypt]] have survived from [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian times]]. The cathedral is located in the centre of the city which evolved around it. It is not spectacular in appearance and the adjacent church ''St. Johann Baptist'', which is located directly within the pedestrian precinct, is often mistakenly referred to as the cathedral. The cathedral treasury, however, ranks amongst the most important in Germany since only few art works have been lost over the centuries. The most precious exhibit, located within the cathedral, is the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] (around 980), the oldest known sculpture of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] and the oldest free-standing sculpture north of the Alps. Other exhibits include the alleged ''child crown'' of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], the eldest preserved seven-branched Christian [[candelabrum]] and several other art works from Ottonian times.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nEssen muenster goldene madonna-4.jpg|[[Golden Madonna of Essen]]\nGolden Madonna.jpg|[[Golden Madonna of Essen]]\nOtto Mathilden Kreuz.jpg|[[Cross of Otto and Mathilde]], 10th century\nEssen StLudger von NW1.jpg|St. Ludger Basilica\nMuenster Rathaus Essen.jpg|Essen Minster overshadowed by the town hall\n</gallery>\n\n=== Old Synagogue ===\n{{Main article|Old Synagogue, Essen}}\nOpened in 1913, the then-New Synagogue served as the central meeting place of Essen's pre-war [[Judaism|Jewish]] community. The building ranks as one of the largest and most impressive testimonies of Jewish culture in pre-[[World War II|war]] Germany. In post-war Germany, the former house of worship was bought by the city, used as an exhibition hall and later rededicated as a cultural meeting centre and house of Jewish culture.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nSynagoge 1917.jpg|Synagogue, 1917\nSynagoge 1922.jpg|Synagogue 1922\nAlte Synagoge, Essen.jpg|Old Synagogue, 2010\nAlte Synagoge Essen 2014.jpg|Old Synagogue, 2014\nEssen - Alte Synagoge in 04 ies.jpg|Old Synagogue interior\n</gallery>\n\n=== Villa H\u00fcgel ===\nBuilt in 1873 by industrial magnate [[Alfred Krupp]], [[Villa H\u00fcgel]], the 269-room mansion ({{convert|8100|m2|sqft|-1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the surrounding park of {{convert|28|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} served as the [[Krupp]] family's representative seat.

The mansion's central [[clock]] became the reference clock for the whole [[Krupp]] enterprise; every clock was to be set with a maximum difference of half a minute. It even acquired its own [[railway station]], ''Essen H\u00fcgel'', which is still a regular stop. The Krupp family had to leave the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] mansion in 1945, when it was annexed by the [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Given back in 1952, Villa H\u00fcgel is now seat of the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]] Foundation (major shareholder of Thyssen-Krupp) and was opened for concerts and sporadic yet high-profile exhibitions.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nVilla huegel.jpg|Villa H\u00fcgel\nVilla H\u00fcgel, Essen, 20071222.jpg|Villa H\u00fcgel\nVilla H\u00fcgel Terrassenseite.jpg|Villa H\u00fcgel\nVilla H\u00fcgel erster Stock.jpg|Great hall\n</gallery>\n\n=== Kettwig and Werden ===\n[[File:Kettwig.jpg|thumb|Borough of [[Kettwig]], annexed in 1975.

All buildings follow the same stylistic concept, with slight variations for each one. Although originally designed as an area for the lower classes with quite small flats, the old part Margarethenh\u00f6he I has developed into a middle class residential area and housing space has become highly sought after. A new part, Margarehenh\u00f6he II, was built in the 1960s and 1970s but is architecturally inferior and especially the multi-storey buildings are still considered social hot spots.\n*[[Moltkeviertel]] (Moltke Quarter): from 1908 on, following reformative plans of the city deputy ''Robert Schmidt'', this quarter was developed just south-east of the city centre. Large green zones, forming broad urban ventilation lanes and incorporating sporting and playing areas and high quality architecture \u2013 invariably in the style of Reform Architecture, combine to create a unique example worldwide of modern town planning. It reflects reformative ideas and dates from the early part of the 20th century. The Moltkeviertel continues to be a much sought-after area for residential, educational, health care and small-scale commercial purposes. On the Moltkeplatz, the quarter's largest square, an ensemble of high quality contemporary art is maintained and cared for by local residents.\n*[[Grugapark]]: With a total area of {{convert|70|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}}, the park near the exhibition halls is one of the largest urban parks in Germany and, although entry is not free of charge, one of the most popular recreational sites of the city.

Its population of 583,109 makes it the [[List of cities in Germany by population|ninth largest city of Germany]], as well as the fourth largest city of the federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. On the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Emscher]] rivers, Essen geographically is part of the [[Rhineland]] and the larger [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]]. The [[Ruhrdeutsch]] [[regiolect]] spoken in the region has strong influences of both [[Low German]] ([[Westphalian language|Westphalian]]) and [[Low Franconian]] ([[East Bergish]]).\n\nEssen is seat to several of the region's authorities, as well as to eight of the 100 largest publicly held German corporations by revenue, including two [[DAX]] corporations. Essen is often considered the energy capital of Germany with [[E.ON]] and [[RWE]], Germany's largest energy providers, both headquartered in the city. Essen is also known for its impact on the arts through the respected [[Folkwang University of the Arts]], its Zollverein School of Management and Design, and the [[Red Dot]] industrial product design award. In early 2003, the universities of Essen and the nearby city of [[Duisburg]] (both established in 1972) were merged into the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] with campuses in both cities and a [[university hospital]] in Essen. In 1958, Essen was chosen to serve as the seat to a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen|Roman Catholic diocese]] (often referred to as ''Ruhrbistum'' or ''diocese of the Ruhr'').\n\nFounded around 845, Essen remained a small town within the sphere of influence of an important [[Imperial Abbey|ecclesiastical principality]] ([[Essen Abbey]]) until the onset of industrialization. The city then \u2014 especially through the [[Krupp]] family iron works \u2014 became one of Germany's most important coal and steel centers. Essen, until the 1970s, attracted workers from all over the country; it was the 5th-largest city in Germany between 1929 and 1988, peaking at over 730,000 inhabitants in 1962. Following the region-wide decline of heavy industries in the last decades of the 20th century, the city has seen the development of a strong [[tertiary sector of the economy]]. The most notable witness of this ''Strukturwandel'' (structural change) is the [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex]], which has once been the largest of its kind in Europe. Ultimately closed in 1993, both the [[coking plant]] and the [[coal mine|mine]] have been inscribed in the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] since 2001.\n\nNotable accomplishments of the city in recent years include the title of [[European Capital of Culture]] on behalf of the whole Ruhr area in 2010 and the selection as the [[European Green Capital]] for 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/applying-for-the-award/2017-egca-applicant-cities/|title=European Green Capital|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== General ===\n<!-- Please do not change the alignment of the column content since they reflect the geographic positions. -->\n{| style=\"width: 400px; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Oberhausen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Oberhausen]]\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:10%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Bottrop COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Bottrop]]\n| style=\"text-align:left; width:15%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Gladbeck COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Gladbeck]]\n| style=\"text-align:left; width:25%; vertical-align:bottom;\"| [[File:DEU Gelsenkirchen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Gelsenkirchen]]\n|-\n| style=\"width:25%; text-align:right;\"| [[File:DEU Muelheim an der Ruhr COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[M\u00fclheim|M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr]]\n| style=\"width:50%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| [[File:Essen Stadtteile und Stadtbezirke.svg|100px|center|Map of the Districts and Boroughs of Essen]] Essen<br /><small>(Map of districts and boroughs)</small>\n| style=\"width:25%; text-align:left;\"| [[File:Stadtwappen der kreisfreien Stadt Bochum.svg|20px]]<br />[[Bochum]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Ratingen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Ratingen]]\n| style=\"text-align:right; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Heiligenhaus COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Heiligenhaus]]\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Velbert COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Velbert]]\n| style=\"text-align:left; width:25%; vertical-align:top;\"| [[File:DEU Hattingen COA.svg|20px]]<br />[[Hattingen]]\n|-\n|}\nEssen is located in the centre of the [[Ruhr]] area, one of the largest [[urban area]]s in Europe (see also: [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]]), comprising eleven [[independent city|independent cities]] and four [[district]]s with some 5.3 million inhabitants. The city limits of Essen itself are {{convert|87|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and border ten cities, five independent and five ''kreisangeh\u00f6rig'' (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 1.4 million. The city extends over {{convert|21|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south and {{convert|17|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from west to east, mainly north of the [[Ruhr (river)|River Ruhr]].\n\nThe Ruhr forms the ''Lake Baldeney'' [[reservoir]] in the boroughs of Fischlaken, Kupferdreh, Heisingen and [[Essen-Werden|Werden]]. The lake, a popular recreational area, dates from 1931 to 1933, when some thousands of unemployed [[coal miner]]s dredged it with primitive tools. Generally, large areas south of the River Ruhr (including the suburbs of Schuir and [[Kettwig]]) are quite green and are often quoted as examples of rural structures in the otherwise relatively densely populated central Ruhr area. According to the [[Federal Statistical Office of Germany]], Essen with 9.2% of its area covered by recreational green is the greenest city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-125300649.html|title=Kommunen: Der Tausendf\u00fc\u00dfler|date=October 2014|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> and the third-greenest city in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/reise-leben/top-ten-das-sind-deutschlands-gruenste-staedte/4369498.html|title=Top ten: Das sind Deutschlands gr\u00fcnste St\u00e4dte|website=www.handelsblatt.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> The city has been shortlisted for the title of [[European Green Capital]] two consecutive times, for 2016 and 2017, winning for 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/media-corner/press-releases/index.html|title=European Green Capital|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> The city was singled out for its exemplary practices in protecting and enhancing nature and biodiversity and efforts to reduce water consumption. Essen participates in a variety of networks and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve the city's resilience in the face of climate change.\n\nThe lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Karnap at {{convert|26.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, the highest point in the borough of Heidhausen at {{convert|202.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The average elevation is {{convert|116|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== City districts ===\n[[File:Essen hbf 1817.jpg|thumb|Main station]]\nEssen comprises fifty boroughs which in turn are grouped into nine suburban districts (called ''[[Stadtbezirk]]e'') often named after the most important boroughs. Each Stadtbezirk is assigned a [[Roman numeral]] and has a local body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1901 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of [[Kettwig]], located south of the Ruhr River, and which was not annexed until 1975, has its own [[Telephone numbering plan|area code]]. Additionally (allegedly due to relatively high church tax incomes), the Archbishop of Cologne managed to keep Kettwig directly subject to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Archdiocese of Cologne]], whereas all other boroughs of Essen and some neighboring cities constitute the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen|Diocese of Essen]]''.''\n\n=== Climate ===\nEssen has a typical [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'') with cool winters and warm summers (different of [[Berlin]] or [[Stuttgart]]). Without large mountains and the presence of inland seas, it ends up extending a predominantly [[Oceanic climate|marine climate]] is found in '''Essen''', usually a little more extreme and drier in other continents in such [[Location|geographical location]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=1401&cityname=Essen,+North+Rhine-Westphalia,+Germany&units=|title=Essen, Germany K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref> Its average annual temperature is {{convert|10|C|F|0}}: {{convert|13.3|C|F|0}} during the day and {{convert|6.7|C|F|0}} at night.

size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions. \nSource:<ref>[https://www.it.nrw/statistik Statistisches Landesamt Nordrhein-Westfalen]</ref>}}\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\nIn German-speaking countries, the name of the city Essen often causes confusion as to its origins, because it is commonly known as the German [[infinitive]] of the [[German verbs|verb]] for \"eating\" (written as lowercase ''[[wikt:essen|essen]]''), and/or the German [[German nouns|noun]] for [[food]] (which is always [[capitalization|capitalized]] as ''[[wikt:Essen|Essen]]'', adding to the confusion). Although scholars still dispute the interpretation of the name,<ref>{{cite web|author=Stadt Essen |url=https://www.essen.de/rathaus/aemter/ordner_41/stadtarchiv/geschichte/Geschichte_Namensdeutung.de.html |title=Origin of place names|language=German |publisher=Essen.de |date= |accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> there remain a few noteworthy interpretations. The oldest known form of the city's name is ''Astnide'', which changed to Essen by way of forms such as Astnidum, Assinde, Essendia and Esnede. The name Astnide may have referred either to a region where many [[ash tree]]s were found or to a region in the East (of the [[Frankish Empire]]).<ref>Paul Derks: ''Der Ortsname Essen'', in: ''Essener Beitr\u00e4ge'' 103 (1989/90), pp. 27\u201351</ref> The [[Old High German]] word for fireplace, Esse, is also commonly mentioned due to the industrial history of the city, but is highly unlikely since the old forms of the city name originate from times before industrialization.\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe oldest archaeological find, the ''[[Vogelheimer Klinge]]'', dates back to 280,000 \u2013 250,000 BC. It is a [[blade]] found in the borough of {{Interlanguage link multi|Vogelheim|de}} in the northern part of the city during the construction of the [[Rhine\u2013Herne Canal]] in 1926.<ref>[https://media.essen.de/media/wwwessende/aemter/41/stadtarchiv/1_ergrabene_zeit.pdf \"Ergrabene Zeiten\"], City of Essen, undated {{in lang|de}}</ref> Other artifacts from the [[Stone Age]] have also been found, although these are not overly numerous. Land utilization was very high \u2013 especially due to mining activities during the Industrial Age \u2013 and any more major finds, especially from the [[Mesolithic]] era, are not expected. Finds from 3,000 BC and onwards are far more common, the most important one being a [[Megalith|Megalithic tomb]] found in 1937. Simply called Steinkiste (Chest of Stone), it is referred to as \"Essen's earliest preserved example of architecture\".<ref>Detlef Hopp: ''Essen vor der Geschichte \u2013 Die Arch\u00e4ologie der Stadt bis zum 9. Jahrhundert'', in Borsdorf (Ed.): ''Essen \u2013 Geschichte einer Stadt'', 2002, p. 32</ref>\n\nEssen was part of the settlement areas of several Germanic peoples ([[Chatti]], [[Bructeri]], [[Marsi (Germanic)|Marsi]]), although a clear distinction among these groupings is difficult.\n\nThe Alteburg castle in the south of Essen dates back to the 1st or 2nd century BC, the Herrenburg to the 8th century [[AD]].\n\nRecent research into [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' has identified the ''polis'' or ''[[oppidum]]'' [[Navalia]] as Essen.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/mapping-ancient-germania-berlin-researchers-crack-the-ptolemy-code-a-720513.html \"Mapping Ancient Germania: Berlin Researchers Crack the Ptolemy Code\"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]''</ref>\n\n=== 8th\u201312th centuries ===\n[[File:Essen 2011 66-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Essen Minster]]]]\nAround 845, Saint [[Altfrid]] (around 800\u2013874), the later [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|Bishop of Hildesheim]], founded an abbey for women (''coenobium Astnide'') in the centre of present-day Essen. The first abbess was Altfrid's relative Gerswit (see also: [[Essen Abbey]]). In 799, [[Liudger|Saint Liudger]] had already founded [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] [[Werden Abbey]] on its own grounds a few kilometers south. The region was sparsely populated with only a few [[smallholding]]s and an old and probably abandoned castle. Whereas Werden Abbey sought to support Liudger's missionary work in the [[Harz]] region ([[Helmstedt]]/[[Halberstadt]]), Essen Abbey was meant to care for women of the higher [[Saxons|Saxon]] nobility. This abbey was not an abbey in the ordinary sense, but rather intended as a residence and educational institution for the daughters and widows of the higher nobility; led by an abbess, the members other than the abbess herself were not obliged to take vows of [[chastity]].\n\nAround 852, construction of the collegiate church of the abbey began, to be completed in 870. A major fire in 946 heavily damaged both the church and the settlement. The church was rebuilt, expanded considerably, and is the foundation of the present Essen Cathedral.\n\nThe first documented mention of Essen dates back to 898, when [[Zwentibold]], King of [[Lotharingia]], willed territory on the western bank of the [[Rhine|River Rhine]] to the abbey. Another document, describing the foundation of the abbey and allegedly dating back to 870, is now considered an 11th-century forgery.\n\nIn 971, [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen|Mathilde II]], granddaughter of Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], took charge of the abbey. She was to become the most important of all abbesses in the history of Essen. She reigned for over 40 years, and endowed the abbey's treasury with invaluable objects such as the oldest preserved seven branched candelabrum, and the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]], the oldest known [[Madonna (art)|sculpture of the Virgin Mary]] in the western world. Mathilde was succeeded by other women related to the [[Ottonian]] emperors: Sophia, daughter of [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] and sister of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], and Teophanu, granddaughter of Otto II. It was under the reign of Teophanu that Essen, which had been called a city since 1003, received the right to hold markets in 1041. Ten years later, Teophanu had the eastern part of Essen Abbey constructed. Its [[crypt]] contains the tombs of St. Altfrid, Mathilde II, and Teophanu herself.\n\n=== 13th\u201317th centuries ===\n[[File:Altessen, Weltladen Alte Kirche foto3 2012-08-19 12.43.jpg|thumb|upright|Alte Kirche (Old Church, built 1887), Altenessen]]\nIn 1216, the abbey, which had only been an important landowner until then, gained the status of a princely residence when Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] called abbess Elisabeth I ''Reichsf\u00fcrstin'' (''Princess of the Empire'') in an official letter. In 1244, 28 years later, Essen received its town charter and seal when [[Konrad von Hochstaden]], the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], marched into the city and erected a city wall together with the population. This proved a temporary emancipation of the population of the city from the princess-abbesses, but this lasted only until 1290. That year, King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]] restored the princess-abbesses to full sovereignty over the city, much to the dismay of the population of the growing city, who called for self-administration and [[imperial immediacy]]. The title [[free imperial city]] was finally granted by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1377. However, in 1372, Charles had paradoxically endorsed Rudolph I's 1290 decision and hence left both the abbey and the city in imperial favour. Disputes between the city and the abbey about supremacy over the region remained common until the abbey's dissolution in 1803. Many lawsuits were filed at the [[Reichskammergericht]], one of them lasting almost 200 years. The final decision of the court in 1670 was that the city had to be \"duly obedient in dos and don'ts\" to the abbesses but could maintain its old rights\u2014a decision that did not really solve any of the problems.\n\nIn 1563, the city council, with its self-conception as the only legitimate ruler of Essen, introduced the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The Catholic abbey had no troops to counter this development.\n\n=== Thirty Years' War ===\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Protestant city and the Catholic abbey opposed each other. In 1623, princess-abbess Maria Clara von Spaur, Pflaum und Val\u00f6r, managed to direct Catholic Spaniards against the city in order to initiate a [[Counter-Reformation]]. In 1624, a \"re-Catholicization\" law was enacted, and churchgoing was strictly controlled. In 1628, the city council filed against this at the Reichskammergericht. Maria had to flee to Cologne when the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] stormed the city in 1629. She returned in the summer of 1631 following the [[Bavarians]] under [[Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim]], only to leave again in September. She died 1644 in Cologne.\n\nThe war proved a severe blow to the city, with frequent arrests, kidnapping and rape. Even after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] from 1648, troops remained in the city until 9 September 1650.\n\n=== Industrialisation ===\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|image1=Drei Ringe von Krupp.jpg|image2=Essen, Stammhaus Krupp, 2014-11 CN-02.jpg|width=200|footer=Three rings of the [[Krupp]] logo and the historic house of the Krupp Family in 2014}}\nThe first historic evidence of the important mining tradition of Essen date back to the 14th century, when the princess-abbess was granted mining rights. The first silver mine opened in 1354, but the indisputably more important coal was not mentioned until 1371, and coal mining only began in 1450.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century, many coal mines had opened in Essen, and the city earned a name as a centre of the weapons industry. Around 1570, [[gunsmith]]s made high profits and in 1620, they produced 14,000 rifles and pistols a year. The city became increasingly important strategically.\n\nResident in Essen since the 16th century, the Krupp family dynasty and Essen shaped each other. In 1811, [[Friedrich Krupp]] founded Germany's first cast-steel factory in Essen and laid the cornerstone for what was to be the largest enterprise in Europe for a couple of decades. The weapon factories in Essen became so important that a sign facing the [[Essen Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] welcomed visitors [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] to the \"Armory of the [[Third Reich|Reich]]\" ({{lang-de|Waffenschmiede des Reiches}}) in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrw2000.de/ns/hitler_mussolini.htm|title=NRW 2000 \u2013 Epoche des Nationalsozialismus \u2013 Einleitung \u2013 Hitler und Mussolini besuchen die \"Waffenschmiede des Reiches\" und die Krupp-Werke Essen|publisher=Nrw2000.de|date=25 September 1937|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112925/http://www.nrw2000.de/ns/hitler_mussolini.htm|archivedate=16 July 2011}}</ref> The Krupp Works also were the main reason for the [[:File:Essen Bevoelkerungsentwicklung 01 KMJ.png|large population growth]] beginning in the mid-19th century. Essen reached a population of 100,000 in 1896. Other industrialists, such as [[Friedrich Grillo]], who in 1892 donated the [[Grillo-Theater]] to the city, also played a major role in the shaping of the city and the [[Ruhr]] area in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\n=== First World War ===\nRiots broke out in February 1917 following a breakdown in the supply of flour.

Between the early 15th and 20th centuries, the political system of Essen underwent several changes, most importantly the introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1563, the [[annexation]] of 1802 by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and the subsequent [[secularization]] of the principality in 1803. The territory was made part of the Prussian [[Province of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]] from 1815 to 1822, after which it became part of the Prussian [[Rhine Province]] until its dissolution in 1946.\n\nDuring the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], Essen was the home of the Essen Tendency (Essener Richtung) within the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany]]. In 1922 they founded the [[Communist Workers' International]]. Essen became one of the centres of resistance to [[Social Democracy]] and the [[Freikorps]] alike.\n\nDuring the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the [[Nazi Party]]. After [[World War II]], the military government of the [[British occupation zone]] installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. Later, the city council was again elected by the population. The mayor was elected by the council as its head and as the city's main [[Representation (politics)|representative]]. The [[Executive (government)|administration]] was led by a full-time ''Oberstadtdirektor''. In 1999, the position of Oberstadtdirektor was abolished in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and the mayor became both main representative and administrative head. In addition, the population now elects the mayor directly.\n\n=== City council ===\nThe last local elections took place on 27 September 2015.

Granted in 1886, it is a so-called ''Allianzwappen'' ([[arms of alliance]]) and consists of two separate shields under a single crown. Most other coats of arms of cities show a wall instead of a crown. The crown, however, does not refer to the city of Essen itself, but instead to the [[German Mediatisation|secularized]] [[Principality|ecclesiastical principality]] of [[Essen Abbey|Essen]] under the reign of the princess-abbesses. The dexter (heraldically right) [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] shows the double-headed Imperial Eagle of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], granted to the city in 1623. The sinister (heraldically left) escutcheon is one of the oldest emblems of Essen and shows a sword that people believed was used to behead the city's [[patron saint|patron]] [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]]. People tend to connect the sword in the left shield with one found in the Cathedral Treasury. This sword, however, is much more recent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regesta-imperii.adwmainz.de/regesten/regshow.php?pk=8837&offset=0&bandanzeige=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311161524/http://regesta-imperii.adwmainz.de/regesten/regshow.php?pk=8837&offset=0&bandanzeige=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 March 2007|title=Origin of the sword in the Essen Cathedral Treasury|publisher=Regesta-imperii.adwmainz.de|accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> A slightly modified and more heraldically correct version of the coat of arms can be found on the roof of the ''Handelshof'' hotel near the main station.\n[[File:Hotel Handelshof Essen.jpg|thumb|The Handelshof Hotel with modified coat of arms and unofficial motto]]\n\n=== International relations ===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\nEssen is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.essen.de/rathaus/europa/foerderprogramme/europa_fuer_buergerinnen_und_buerger.de.html |title=Politikfeld B\u00fcrgerbegegnungen und St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften: St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften |publisher=Presse- und Kommunikationsamt, Oberb\u00fcrgermeister, Stadt Essen |type=official website |website=Essen.de |language=German |accessdate=2014-11-17}}</ref>\n* [[Grenoble]], France <small>''(since 1974)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=J\u00e9r\u00f4me Steffenino, Marguerite Masson |url=http://www.grenoble.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page_id=92 |title=Ville de Grenoble \u2013 Coop\u00e9rations et villes jumelles |publisher=Grenoble.fr |date= |accessdate=29 October 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014074034/http://www.grenoble.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page_id=92|archivedate=14 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=J\u00e9r\u00f4me Steffenino, Marguerite Masson |url=http://www.grenoble.fr/103-jumelages-et-cooperations.htm|title=Ville de Grenoble \u2013Coop\u00e9rations et villes jumelles |publisher=Grenoble.fr |date= |accessdate=16 May 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Nizhny Novgorod]], Russia <small>''(since 1991)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[City of Sunderland]], United Kingdom <small>''(since 1949)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Tampere]], Finland <small>''(since 1960)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Tel Aviv]], Israel <small>''(since 1991)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\nThe [[Monessen, Pennsylvania|City of Monessen, Pennsylvania]], situated along the [[Monongahela River]], was named after the river and Essen.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harvath |first=Les |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_497856.html |title=School colors glimpse history|work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|date=18 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202044754/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_497856.html|archive-date=2010-02-02|access-date=2017-02-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere are cooperations with the following cities:<ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\"/>\n\n* [[Erfurt]], Germany <small>''(since 1991)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Zabrze]], Poland <small>''(since 2008)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n* [[Qingdao|Quingdao]], China <small>''(since 2008)''</small><ref name=\"RuhrTwins2010\" />\n\n== Industry and infrastructure ==\n\n=== Economy ===\nEssen is home to several large companies, among them the [[ThyssenKrupp]] industrial conglomerate which is also registered in [[Duisburg]] and originates from a 1999 merger between Duisburg-based ''Thyssen AG'' and Essen-based [[Krupp|Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp]].

Each day, it produces a 30-minute regional evening news magazine (called ''Lokalzeit Ruhr''), a 5-minute afternoon news programme, and several radio news programmes. A local broadcasting station went on air in the late 1990s. The [[WAZ-Mediengruppe|WAZ Media Group]] is one of the most important (print) media companies in Europe and publishes the Ruhr area's two most important daily newspapers, ''[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' (WAZ; 580,000 copies) and ''Neue Ruhr/Rhein Zeitung'' (NRZ; 180,000 copies). In Essen, the WAZ Group also publishes the local ''Borbecker Nachrichten'' (at times Germany's largest local newspaper){{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} and ''Werdener Nachrichten'', both of which had been independent weekly newspapers for parts of Essen. Additionally, [[Axel Springer AG|Axel Springer]] run a printing facility for their boulevard-style daily paper ''[[Bild]]'' in Essen.\n\n=== Education ===\nOne renowned educational institution in Essen is the [[Folkwang University]], a university of the arts founded in 1927, which is headquartered in Essen and has additional facilities in Duisburg, [[Bochum]] and [[Dortmund]]. Since 1927, its traditional main location has been in the former [[Werden Abbey]] in Essen in the [[Ruhr Area]], with additional facilities in [[Duisburg]], [[Bochum]], and [[Dortmund]], and, since 2010, at the [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex|Zeche Zollverein]], a [[World Heritage Site]] also in Essen.<ref>[http://www.dradio.de/kulturnachrichten/2010011014/6/ Deutschlandradio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305222627/http://www.dradio.de/kulturnachrichten/2010011014/6/ |date=2012-03-05 }} New Name and Building, 10 January 2010 (in German)</ref> The Folkwang University is home to the international dance company ''Folkwang Tanz Studio'' (FTS). In 1963 the Folkwang school was renamed ''Folkwang-Hochschule'' (Folkwang Academy). In 2010 the institution began offering graduate studies and was renamed Folkwang University of the Arts. This coincided with [[Ruhr.2010]], the festival in which the [[Ruhr]] district was designated the [[European Capital of Culture]] for the year 2010.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nEssen_Kloster_Werden_Innenhof_2_2005.jpg|[[Folkwang University of the Arts]]\nZollverein School of Management and Design 3116754.jpg|Zollverein School of Management and Design\nUniversit\u00e4t Essen Panorama.jpg|Universit\u00e4t Essen\nEssen Werden - Folkwang-Hochschule 08 ies.jpg|Folkwang University\n</gallery>\n\nThe [[University of Duisburg-Essen]], which resulted from a 2003 merger of the universities of Essen and Duisburg, is one of Germany's \"youngest\" universities with about 42,000 Students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioessen.de/essen/lokalnachrichten/lokalnachrichten/archive/2016/01/08/article/-84812ba8fa.html|title=Lokalnachrichten: Radio Essen|first=Radio|last=Essen|website=www.radioessen.de|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> One of its primary research areas is ''urban systems'' (i.e., sustainable development, logistics and transportation), a theme largely inspired by the highly urbanised Ruhr area. Other fields include [[nanotechnology]], [[discrete mathematics]] and \"education in the 21st century\". Another university in Essen is the private ''[[Fachhochschule]] f\u00fcr \u00d6konomie und Management'', a university of applied sciences with over 6,000 students and branches in 15 other major cities throughout Germany.\n\n=== Medicine ===\nEssen offers a highly diversified health care system with more than 1,350 resident doctors and almost 6,000 beds in 13 hospitals, including a university hospital. The university hospital dates back to 1909, when the city council established a municipal hospital; although it was largely destroyed during [[World War II]], it was later rebuilt, and finally gained the title of a university hospital in 1963. It focuses on [[List of ICD-9 codes 390-459: Diseases of the circulatory system#7. Diseases of the circulatory system (390\u2013459)|diseases of the circulatory system]] (West German Heart Centre Essen), [[oncology]] and [[organ transplant|transplantation medicine]], with the department of [[bone marrow transplant]]ation being the second-largest of its kind in the world.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nElisabethkrankenhaus Essen.jpg|Elisabethkrankenhaus Essen\nUniklinik Essen, 20071222.jpg|University Hospital Essen\n</gallery>\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n==== Streets and motorways ====\n[[File:A40-Ruhrschnellweg-Huttrop.jpg|thumb|[[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] facing towards the [[central business district]] of Essen]]\nThe road network of Essen consists of over 3,200 streets, which in total have a length of roughly {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThree ''[[German Autobahnen|Autobahnen]]'' touch Essen territory, most importantly the [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] (Ruhr expressway, A 40), which runs directly through the city, dividing it roughly in half. In a west-eastern direction, the A 40 connects the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Venlo]] with Dortmund, running through the whole [[Ruhr]] area. It is one of the arterial roads of the Ruhr area (> 140,000 vehicles/day) and suffers from heavy congestion during rush hours, which is why many people in the area nicknamed it ''Ruhrschleichweg'' (Ruhr crawling way). A tunnel was built in the 1970s, when the then-[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]] was upgraded to [[Autobahn|motorway]] standards, so that the A 40 is hidden from public view in the inner-city district near the [[Essen Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]].\n\nIn the north, the [[Bundesautobahn 42|A 42]] briefly touches Essen territory, serving as an interconnection between the neighboring cities of [[Oberhausen]] and [[Gelsenkirchen]] and destinations beyond.\n\nA segment of the [[Bundesautobahn 52|A 52]] connects Essen with the more southern region around [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. On Essen territory, the A 52 runs from the southern boroughs near [[M\u00fclheim|M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr]] past the fairground and then merges with the [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] at the [[Autobahndreieck]] Essen-Ost junction east of the city centre.\n\nWith the A 40/A 52 in the southern parts of the city and the A 42 in the north, there is a gap in the motorway system often leading to congestion on streets leading from the central to the northern boroughs. An extension of the A 52 to connect the Essen-Ost junction with the A 42 to close this gap is considered urgent;<ref>Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2003, p. 124</ref> it has been planned for years but not yet been realized \u2013 most importantly due to the high-density areas this extension would lead through, resulting in high costs and concerns with the citizens.\n\n==== Public transport ====\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the [[DB Regio]] subsidiary of [[Deutsche Bahn]] for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Ruhrbahn, is a member of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]] (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's [[railway line]]s (except the high-speed [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of Ruhrbahn, all other members of VRR, and DB.\n\n{{As of|2009}}, Ruhrbahn operates 3 U-[[Stadtbahn]] lines of the [[Essen Stadtbahn]] network, 7 [[Trams in Essen|Stra\u00dfenbahn (tram)]] lines and 57 bus lines (16 of these serving as ''Nacht Express'' late-night lines only). The Stadtbahn and Stra\u00dfenbahn operate on total route lengths of {{convert|19.6|km|mi}} and {{convert|52.4|km|mi}}, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evag.de/fileadmin/downloads/Geschaeftsberichte_Statistik_Organigramm/Kleine_EVAG_Statistik_2010.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116030233/http://www.evag.de/fileadmin/downloads/Geschaeftsberichte_Statistik_Organigramm/Kleine_EVAG_Statistik_2010.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 16, 2011 |title=Kleine EVAG Statistik 2010* (*stand 31.12.2009) |publisher=Essener Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (EVAG) |language=German |trans-title=Small EVAG Statistics 2010* (*as of 31.12.2009) |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=2013-10-20 }}</ref> One tram line and a few bus lines coming from neighboring cities are operated by these cities' respective carriers. The U-Stadtbahn, which partly runs on used [[Docklands Light Railway]] stock, is a mixture of tram and full [[rapid transit|underground]] systems with 20 underground stations for the U-Stadtbahn and additional 4 underground stations used by the tram. Two lines of the U-Stadtbahn are completely intersection-free and hence independent from other traffic, and the U18 line leading from M\u00fclheim main station to the ''Bismarckplatz'' station at the gates of the city centre partly runs above ground amidst the [[Bundesautobahn 40|A 40 motorway]]. The Essen Stadtbahn is one of the Stadtbahn systems integrated into the greater [[Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn]] network.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nEVAG (Essen) NF2-TW 1601.jpg|[[Essen Stadtbahn]] NF2-TW 1601\nEssen Hbf 02 Empfangsgeb\u00e4ude.jpg|Essen Hauptbahnhof\nEssen Hauptbahnhof Freiheit.jpg|[[Essen Hauptbahnhof]] in the city centre\nU-bahnhof-essenhbf.JPG|[[Essen Hauptbahnhof]] subway station\nStadtbahn Essen - Kaiser-Wilhelm-Park.jpg|Platforms at Kaiser-Wilhelm-Park\n</gallery>\n\nOn the same motorway, a long-term test of a [[guided bus]] system is being held since 1980. Many Ruhrbahn rail lines meet at the main station but only a handful of bus lines. However, all but one of the Nacht Express bus lines originate from / lead to Essen Hauptbahnhof in a star-shaped manner. All Ruhrbahn lines, including the Nacht Express lines, are closed on weekdays from 1:30&nbsp;a.m. to 4:30&nbsp;a.m.\n\nOf the [[Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn]] net's 13 lines, 5 lines lead through Essen territory and meet at the [[Essen Hauptbahnhof]] main station, which also serves as the connection to the [[Regional-Express]] and [[Intercity-Express]] network of regional and nationwide high-speed trains, respectively. Following Essen's appointment as [[European Capital of Culture]] 2010, the main station, which is classified as a [[German railway station categories#Category 1|station of highest importance]] and which had not been substantially renovated over decades, will be redeveloped with a budget of \u20ac57 million until early 2010.<ref>[http://www.bmvbs.de/-,302.1040342/doc.htm Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906113721/http://www.bmvbs.de/-,302.1040342/doc.htm |date=September 6, 2009 }}</ref> Other important stations in Essen, where regional and local traffic are connected, are the {{lang|de|Regionalbahnh\u00f6fe}} (regional railway stations) in the boroughs of Altenessen, [[Essen-Borbeck-Mitte|Borbeck]], Kray and Steele. Further 20 S-Bahn stations can be found in the whole urban area.\n\nIn 2017 the public transport organization of M\u00fclheim, the M\u00fclheimer Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG) and the Essener Verkehrsgesellschaft (EVAG) merged and became the ''Ruhrbahn''. All vehicles and staff were merged and are now operated together.\n\n==== Aviation ====\n[[File:Luftbild Flughafen Essen-M\u00fclheim.JPG|thumb|[[Essen/M\u00fclheim Airport]]]]\nTogether with the neighbouring city of [[M\u00fclheim|M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr]] and the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Essen maintains [[Essen/M\u00fclheim Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA]]: ESS, [[ICAO airport code|ICAO]]: EDLE). While the first flights had already arrived in 1919, it was officially opened on 25 August 1925. Significantly expanded in 1935, Essen/M\u00fclheim became the central airport of the Ruhr area until the end of the [[Second World War]], providing an [[asphalt]]ed runway of {{convert|1553|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, another unsurfaced runway for [[gliding]] and destinations to most major [[Europe]]an cities. It was heavily damaged during the war, yet partly reconstructed and used by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as a secondary airport since visibility is less often [[fog|obscured]] than at [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]]. The latter then developed into the large civil airport that it is now, while Essen/M\u00fclheim now mainly serves occasional air traffic (some 33,000 passengers each year),<ref>According to ''RVV-Verkehrsstatistik 2007'' (''RVV'' Traffic Statistics 2007).</ref> the base of a fleet of [[airships]] and Germany's oldest public [[flight training]] company. Residents of the region around Essen typically use [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]] (~ 20 driving minutes) and occasionally [[Dortmund Airport]] (~ 30 driving minutes) for both domestic and international flights.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n=== Zollverein Industrial Complex ===\nThe [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex]] is the city's most famous landmark. For decades, the coal mine (current form mainly from 1932, closed in 1986) and the coking plant (closed in 1993) ranked among the largest of their kinds in Europe. Shaft XII, built in [[Bauhaus]] style, with its characteristic winding tower, which over the years has become a symbol for the whole [[Ruhr]] area, is considered an architectural and technical masterpiece, earning it a reputation as the \"most beautiful coal mine in the world\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.erih.net/index.php?anchor=66&pageId=40 |title=European Route of Industrial Heritage |publisher=En.erih.net |accessdate=6 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211954/http://en.erih.net/index.php?anchor=66&pageId=40 |archivedate=5 February 2012 }}</ref> After [[UNESCO]] had declared it a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2001, the complex, which had lain idle for a long time and was even threatened to be demolished, began to see a period of redevelopment. Under the direction of an agency borne by the land of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and the city itself, several arts and design institutions settled mainly on the grounds of the former coal mine; a redevelopment plan for the coking plant is to be realised.\n\nOn the grounds of the coal mine and the coking plant, which are both accessible free of charge while paid guided tours (some with former {{lang|de|[[miner|Kumpels]]}}) are available, several tourist attractions can be found, most importantly the ''Design Zentrum NRW''/[[Red Dot|Red Dot Design Museum]]. The ''Ruhrmuseum'', a museum dedicated to the history of the Ruhr area, which had been existing since 1904, opened its gates as one of the anchor attractions in the former coal-washing facility in 2010.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nFile:Zeche Zollverein Essen Okt10 011.jpg|Coal mine Zollverein\nFile:Zeche Zollverein abends.jpg|Shaft XII of Zollverein\nFile:Essen - Zeche-Zollverein - Eingangstor - 2013.jpg|Zollverein entrance\nFile:Rolltreppe Ruhrmuseum.jpg|Ruhrmuseum\nFile:Ruhrmuseum Staircase.jpg|Ruhrmuseum staircase\n</gallery>\n\n=== Essen Minster and treasury ===\nThe former collegiate church of [[Essen Abbey]] and nowadays cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen|Bishop of Essen]] is a [[Gothic art|Gothic]] hall church made from light [[sandstone]]. The first church on the premises dates back to between 845 and 870; the current church was constructed after a former church had burnt down in 1275. However, the important [[westwork]] and [[crypt]] have survived from [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian times]]. The cathedral is located in the centre of the city which evolved around it. It is not spectacular in appearance and the adjacent church ''St. Johann Baptist'', which is located directly within the pedestrian precinct, is often mistakenly referred to as the cathedral. The cathedral treasury, however, ranks amongst the most important in Germany since only few art works have been lost over the centuries. The most precious exhibit, located within the cathedral, is the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] (around 980), the oldest known sculpture of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] and the oldest free-standing sculpture north of the Alps. Other exhibits include the alleged ''child crown'' of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], the eldest preserved seven-branched Christian [[candelabrum]] and several other art works from Ottonian times.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nEssen muenster goldene madonna-4.jpg|[[Golden Madonna of Essen]]\nGolden Madonna.jpg|[[Golden Madonna of Essen]]\nOtto Mathilden Kreuz.jpg|[[Cross of Otto and Mathilde]], 10th century\nEssen StLudger von NW1.jpg|St. Ludger Basilica\nMuenster Rathaus Essen.jpg|Essen Minster overshadowed by the town hall\n</gallery>\n\n=== Old Synagogue ===\n{{Main|Old Synagogue, Essen}}\nOpened in 1913, the then-New Synagogue served as the central meeting place of Essen's pre-war [[Judaism|Jewish]] community. The building ranks as one of the largest and most impressive testimonies of Jewish culture in pre-[[World War II|war]] Germany.

The mansion's central [[clock]] became the reference clock for the whole Krupp enterprise; every clock was to be set with a maximum difference of half a minute. It even acquired its own [[railway station]], ''Essen H\u00fcgel'', which is still a regular stop. The Krupp family had to leave the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] mansion in 1945, when it was annexed by the [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Given back in 1952, Villa H\u00fcgel is now seat of the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]] Foundation (major shareholder of Thyssen-Krupp) and was opened for concerts and sporadic yet high-profile exhibitions.\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nVilla huegel.jpg|Villa H\u00fcgel\nVilla H\u00fcgel, Essen, 20071222.jpg|Villa H\u00fcgel\nVilla H\u00fcgel Terrassenseite.jpg|Villa H\u00fcgel\nVilla H\u00fcgel erster Stock.jpg|Great hall\n</gallery>\n\n=== Kettwig and Werden ===\n[[File:Kettwig.jpg|thumb|Borough of [[Kettwig]], annexed in 1975.

All buildings follow the same stylistic concept, with slight variations for each one. Although originally designed as an area for the lower classes with quite small flats, the old part Margarethenh\u00f6he I has developed into a middle class residential area and housing space has become highly sought after. A new part, Margarehenh\u00f6he II, was built in the 1960s and 1970s but is architecturally inferior and especially the multi-storey buildings are still considered social hot spots.\n*[[Moltkeviertel]] (Moltke Quarter): from 1908 on, following reformative plans of the city deputy ''Robert Schmidt'', this quarter was developed just south-east of the city centre. Large green zones, forming broad urban ventilation lanes and incorporating sporting and playing areas and high quality architecture \u2013 invariably in the style of Reform Architecture, combine to create a unique example worldwide of modern town planning. It reflects reformative ideas and dates from the early part of the 20th century. The Moltkeviertel continues to be a much sought-after area for residential, educational, health care and small-scale commercial purposes.

It was nominated for six [[Black Reel Awards]].\n\n== Plot summary ==\n{{long plot|date=October 2015}}\nPercival ([[Andre 3000]]) and Rooster ([[Big Boi]]) have been good friends since childhood. However, as they grow up, they each begin to live separate lives. In 1935, Percival works at his father Percy Senior's ([[Ben Vereen|Vereen]]) morgue during the day, and works at a local club called Church at night playing the piano. Rooster becomes a singer at the club and a [[rumrunning|bootlegger]]; he also marries Zora ([[Malinda Williams|Williams]]), with whom he has five children.\n\nOne night when Rooster shows up late to the club, everyone becomes upset and rowdy including gangsters Spats ([[Ving Rhames|Rhames]]), Trumpy ([[Terrence Howard|Howard]]), Ace ([[Faizon Love|Love]]) and Rose ([[Paula Jai Parker]]) who have a business deal with the club and Rooster. Finally Rooster shows up and performs; Rooster, Spats, Trumpy and Ace talk about their deal. Spats wishes to get out of the business, and is willing to sell out to Ace. Meanwhile, backstage, a singer from St. Louis named Angel Davenport ([[Paula Patton]]) comes into the club and starts to complain about her train ride and her contract with the club. Angel is actually an imposter; she is really an aspiring singer named Sally B. Shelley, who stole the contract from the real Davenport ([[Patti Labelle|Labelle]]).\n\nRooster and Rose have sex in a car in a warehouse until they hear people coming into the warehouse, Rose jumps out of the car, gets dressed and confronts Spats, Trumpy and Ace who have just arrived. Rose then runs off, Trumpy then shoots and kills Spats and Ace in order to get the business for himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooster runs into Trumpy while taking his family shopping and Trumpy explains that the debt owed by Ace is now his problem. He has to come up with this money by selling liquor at Church bought from Trumpy's \"suppliers\". Rooster goes to Rose's house to warn her, but she is already packed up and ready to leave. As Rose drives away in a taxi, she is being watched by one of Trumpy's henchmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooster begins to have more problems at the club, and forces Angel to sing. Angel has an attack of [[stage fright]], but Percival calms her by giving her a song that he wrote for her. The song is a hit, and Angel becomes an overnight star; she and Percival also fall in love. During a storm, Angel runs over to the morgue to be with Percival, and the two have sex.\n\nRoosters's wife Zora gets tired of his cheating and moves with their children to her mother's house. Angel gets a record deal in Chicago and asks Percival to go with her, but he reluctantly declines, as he feels obligated to his father. When Angel finds out that Percival knows who she really is, however, she pledges her love to him and persuades him to go to Chicago with her.\n\nRooster devises a plan to buy liquor from bootlegger GW ([[Bill Nunn|Nunn]]) and his partner. One day, Rooster is making his rounds to pick up hooch from GW to load in a hearse borrowed from Percival, when he sees a car on the road that seems to be stuck. He approaches the car to see an old woman, Mother Hopkins ([[Cicely Tyson|Tyson]]), and her grandchildren. Mother Hopkins tells Rooster that he is an angel and gives him a bible. Rooster walks into the old abandoned house of the two bootleggers and sees that Trumpy's henchmen have beaten up GW and killed his partner.\n\nRooster is caught and brought to Trumpy, and GW is shot and killed. There is a fight between Rooster and Trumpy's henchmen. Rooster is shot but not killed due to the bible in his jacket and drives away in the hearse. However, Trumpy pursues him and shoots at him.  Rooster escapes into the Church club, and soon after Trumpy arrives at the club. Before going to Chicago, Angel and Percival decide to make a stop at the Church club, Rooster and Trumpy have a dramatic fight in the club and shots are fired by Trumpy. Everyone in the club panics, and just when Trumpy is about to shoot Rooster, Trumpy is shot and killed by Percival.\n\nPercival then notices that Angel has been shot and runs to her aid. However Angel dies soon afterward and Percival begins to grieve. He then tends to her and prepares her for burial, dressing her up in a wedding gown and slipping a ring on her finger, implying that he was planning on marrying her. Afterward, Percival attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself in his room, but is interrupted when Rooster rings the doorbell. Percival is consoled and gives Angel's Chicago bound ticket to Rooster, who is then reunited with his wife and children. Percival then begins to make records and tour in clubs throughout America and becomes famous. The film ends with pictures of Percival, and Angel in her coffin hung next to a picture of Percival's mother in her coffin at Percival's house.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Andr\u00e9 3000]] ...

Elements of 1930s-era [[blues]] and [[jazz music]] are however featured prominently in many of the musical numbers. The film's dance numbers, choreographed by [[Hinton Battle]], also feature many period dances, primarily the [[jitterbug]].\n\nMost of the songs in ''Idlewild'' had already been featured on the OutKast albums ''[[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast]]'' and ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', essentially making ''Idlewild'' a [[jukebox musical]].

It was nominated for six [[Black Reel Awards]].\n\n== Plot summary ==\n{{long plot|date=October 2015}}\nPercival ([[Andre 3000]]) and Rooster ([[Big Boi]]) have been good friends since childhood. However, as they grow up, they each begin to live separate lives. In 1935, Percival works at his father Percy Senior's ([[Ben Vereen|Vereen]]) morgue during the day, and works at a local club called Church at night playing the piano. Rooster becomes a singer at the club and a [[rumrunning|bootlegger]]; he also gets married to Zora ([[Malinda Williams|Williams]]), with whom he has five children.\n\nOne night when Rooster shows up late to the club, everyone becomes upset and rowdy including gangsters Spats ([[Ving Rhames|Rhames]]), Trumpy ([[Terrence Howard|Howard]]), Ace ([[Faizon Love|Love]]) and Rose ([[Paula Jai Parker]]) who have a business deal with the club and Rooster.  Finally Rooster shows up and performs; Rooster, Spats, Trumpy and Ace talk about their deal. Spats wishes to get out of the business, and is willing to sell out to Ace. Meanwhile, backstage, a  singer from St. Louis named Angel Davenport ([[Paula Patton]]) comes into the club and starts to complain about her train ride and her contract with the club. Angel is actually an imposter; she is really an aspiring singer named Sally B. Shelley, who stole the contract from the real Davenport ([[Patti Labelle|Labelle]]).\n\nRooster and Rose have sex in a car in a warehouse until they hear people coming into the warehouse, Rose jumps out of the car, gets dressed and confronts Spats, Trumpy and Ace who have just arrived. Rose then runs off, Trumpy then shoots and kills Spats and Ace in order to get the business for himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooster runs into Trumpy while taking his family shopping and Trumpy explains that the debt owed by Ace is now his problem. He has to come up with this money by selling liquor at Church bought from Trumpy's \"suppliers\". Rooster goes to Rose's house to warn her, but she is already packed up and ready to leave. As Rose drives away in a taxi, she is being watched by one of Trumpy's henchmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooster begins to have more problems at the club, and forces Angel to sing. Angel has an attack of [[stage fright]], but Percival calms her by giving her a song that he wrote for her. The song is a hit, and Angel becomes an overnight star; she and Percival also fall in love. During a storm, Angel runs over to the morgue to be with Percival, and the two have sex.\n\nRoosters's wife Zora gets tired of his cheating and moves with their children to her mother's house. Angel gets a record deal in Chicago and asks Percival to go with her, but he reluctantly declines, as he feels obligated to his father. When Angel finds out that Percival knows who she really is, however, she pledges her love to him and persuades him to go to Chicago with her.\n\nRooster devises a plan to buy liquor from bootlegger GW ([[Bill Nunn|Nunn]]) and his partner. One day, Rooster is making his rounds to pick up hooch from GW to load in a hearse borrowed from Percival, when he sees a car on the road that seems to be stuck. He approaches the car to see an old woman, Mother Hopkins ([[Cicely Tyson|Tyson]]), and her grandchildren. Mother Hopkins tells Rooster that he is an angel and gives him a bible. Rooster walks into the old abandoned house of the two bootleggers and sees that Trumpy's henchmen have beaten up GW and killed his partner.\n\nRooster is caught and brought to Trumpy, and GW is shot and killed. There is a fight between Rooster and Trumpy's henchmen. Rooster is shot but not killed due to the bible in his jacket and drives away in the hearse. However, Trumpy pursues him and shoots at him.  Rooster escapes into the Church club, and soon after Trumpy arrives at the club. Before going to Chicago, Angel and Percival decide to make a stop at the Church club, Rooster and Trumpy have a dramatic fight in the club and shots are fired by Trumpy. Everyone in the club panics, and just when Trumpy is about to shoot Rooster, Trumpy is shot and killed by Percival.\n\nPercival then notices that Angel has been shot and runs to her aid. However Angel dies soon afterward and Percival begins to grieve. He then tends to her and prepares her for burial, dressing her up in a wedding gown and slipping a ring on her finger, implying that he was planning on marrying her. Afterward, Percival attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself in his room, but is interrupted when Rooster rings the doorbell. Percival is consoled and gives Angel's Chicago bound ticket to Rooster, who is then reunited with his wife and children. Percival then begins to make records and tour in clubs throughout America and becomes famous.  The film ends with pictures of Percival, and Angel in her coffin hung next to a picture of Percival's mother in her coffin at Percival's house.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Andr\u00e9 3000]] ...

Elements of 1930s-era [[blues]] and [[jazz music]] are however featured prominently in many of the musical numbers. The film's dance numbers, choreographed by [[Hinton Battle]], also feature many period dances, primarily the [[jitterbug]].\n\nMost of the songs in ''Idlewild'' had already been featured on the OutKast albums ''[[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast]]'' and ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', essentially making ''Idlewild'' a [[jukebox musical]]. Seven of the songs from the film, along with several unreleased songs, were released by [[LaFace Records]] as an [[OutKast]] album entitled ''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]'' at the time of the film's release.\n\n===Musical numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"20\"|#\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Song title\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Character(s)/<br />Performer(s)\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Songwriters\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Album\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|1\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Greatest Show on Earth\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Taffy<br /> <small>([[Macy Gray]] featuring OutKast)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|[[Andr\u00e9 Benjamin]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|2\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\"Makes No Sense at All\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Idlewild''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|3\n|align=\"left\"\" valign=\"top\"|\"Bowtie\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Rooster<br /> <small>([[Big Boi]] featuring [[Sleepy Brown]] and [[Jazze Pha]])</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Antwan Andre Patton, Patrick Brown, Phalon Alexander\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|4\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Chronomentrophobia\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Idlewild''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|5\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"The Rooster\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Rooster<br /> <small>(Big Boi)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Antwan Andre Patton, Carlton \"Carl Mo\" Mahone, Donnie Mathis\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|6\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Movin' Cool (The After Party)\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival & Angel<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000 and Paula Patton, dubbed by [[Debra Killings]])</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin, Antwan Andre Patton, [[Mr. DJ|David Sheats]], [[Joi (singer)|Joi Gilliam-Gipp]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast]]'' <br /> <small>(The original LP version of this song features [[Joi (singer)|Joi]] instead of Killings)</small>\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|7\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Take Off Your Cool\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 3000 and [[Norah Jones]]<br /> <small>(song not performed by characters in film)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Speakerboxx/The Love Below''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|8\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Church\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Rooster<br /> <small>(Big Boi)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Antwan Andre Patton, Andre Benjamin, Kevin Kendricks, Myrna Crenshaw, Patrick Brown\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Speakerboxx/The Love Below''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|9\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"She Lives in My Lap\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin, Willie Dennis, Dino Hawkins, [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Brad Jordan]], Doug King, [[Roger Troutman]], Eric Vidal\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Speakerboxx/The Love Below'' <br /> <small>(The original LP version of this song features [[Rosario Dawson]]</small>\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|10\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Vibrate\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin \n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Speakerboxx/The Love Below''\n|-\n|11\n|\"Mutron Angel\"\n|Outkast featuring Whild Peach\n(song not performed by characters in film)\n|Antwan Andre Patton, D.

The committee secretary is first-in-charge of the province; second-in-command is the governor of the provincial government.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) claims the island of Taiwan and its surrounding islets, including Penghu, as \"[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]]\", though Taiwan has not been under control of a government that ruled from mainland China since 1949, when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] lost the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]], which established the PRC. ([[Kinmen]] and the [[Matsu Islands]] are claimed by the PRC as part of its Fujian Province. The [[Pratas Islands]] and [[Taiping Island]] are claimed by the PRC as part of Guangdong and Hainan provinces respectively.) The territory is controlled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, commonly called \"Taiwan\").\n\n=== Municipality===\n{{Main|Direct-administered municipalities of China}}\n\nA municipality ({{zh |s = \u76f4\u8f96\u5e02 |t = \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02 |p = zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec |l = direct-administrated city |links = no }}) or municipality directly under the administration of the central government is a higher level of city which is directly under the Chinese government, with status equal to that of the provinces. In practice, their political status is higher than that of common provinces.\n\n=== Autonomous region ===\n{{Main|Autonomous regions of China}}\n\nAn autonomous region ({{zh |s = \u81ea\u6cbb\u533a |t = \u81ea\u6cbb\u5340 |p = z\u00eczh\u00ecq\u016b |links = no }}) is a minority subject which has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group along with its own local government, but an autonomous region theoretically has more legislative rights than in actual practice. The governor of each autonomous region is usually appointed from the respective minority ethnic group.\n\n=== Special administrative region (SAR) ===\n{{Main|Special administrative regions of China}}\n\nA special administrative region (SAR) ({{zh |s = \u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a |t = \u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340 |p = t\u00e8bi\u00e9 x\u00edngzh\u00e8ngq\u016b |links = no }}) is a highly autonomous and self-governing sub national subject of the People's Republic of China that is directly under the Central People's Government. Each SAR has a chief executive as head of the region and head of government.

However, China lost four provinces with the establishment of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]] in 1945, China re-incorporated Manchuria as 10 provinces, and assumed control of Taiwan as a province. As a result, the Republic of China in 1946 had 35 provinces. Although the Republic of China now only controls one province ([[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]), and some islands of a second province ([[Fujian]]), it continues to formally claim all 35 provinces

The committee secretary is first-in-charge of the province; second-in-command is the governor of the provincial government.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) claims the island of Taiwan and its surrounding islets, including Penghu, as \"[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]]\", though Taiwan has not been under control of a government that ruled from mainland China since 1949, when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] lost the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]], which established the PRC. ([[Kinmen]] and the [[Matsu Islands]] are claimed by the PRC as part of its Fujian Province. [[Pratas Islands|Pratas]] and [[Taiping Island|Taiping]] are claimed by the PRC as part of Guangdong and Hainan provinces respectively.) The territory is controlled by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, commonly called \"Taiwan\").\n\n=== Municipality===\n{{Main|Direct-administered municipalities of China}}\n\nA municipality ({{zh |s = \u76f4\u8f96\u5e02 |t = \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02 |p = zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec |l = direct-administrated city |links = no }}) or municipality directly under the administration of the central government is a higher level of city which is directly under the Chinese government, with status equal to that of the provinces. In practice, their political status is higher than that of common provinces.\n\n=== Autonomous region ===\n{{Main|Autonomous regions of China}}\n\nAn autonomous region ({{zh |s = \u81ea\u6cbb\u533a |t = \u81ea\u6cbb\u5340 |p = z\u00eczh\u00ecq\u016b |links = no }}) is a minority subject which has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group along with its own local government, but an autonomous region theoretically has more legislative rights than in actual practice. The governor of each autonomous region is usually appointed from the respective minority ethnic group.\n\n=== Special administrative region (SAR) ===\n{{Main|Special administrative regions of China}}\n\nA special administrative region (SAR) ({{zh |s = \u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a |t = \u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340 |p = t\u00e8bi\u00e9 x\u00edngzh\u00e8ngq\u016b |links = no }}) is a highly autonomous and self-governing sub national subject of the People's Republic of China that is directly under the Central People's Government. Each SAR has a chief executive as head of the region and head of government. The region's government is not fully independent, as foreign policy and military defence are the responsibility of the central government, according to the basic laws.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== List of province-level divisions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!colspan=9|{{PRC provinces big imagemap alt}}\n|-\n!align=\"center\"|[[Guobiao|GB/T 2260-2007]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/design/chinastdb_1210.doc# |title=GB/T 2260 codes for the provinces of China |access-date=2011-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040305025950/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/design/chinastdb_1210.doc# |archive-date=2004-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n!align=\"center\"|[[ISO 3166-2:CN|ISO]]<ref>[[ISO 3166-2:CN]] ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 3166-2|3166-2]] codes for the provinces of China)</ref>\n!align=\"left\"|Province\n!align=\"left\"|Chinese<br />Hanyu Pinyin\n!align=\"left\"|Capital\n!align=\"right\"|Population{{efn|as of 2010}}\n!align=\"right\"|Density{{efn|per km<sup>2</sup>}}\n!align=\"right\"|Area{{efn|km<sup>2</sup>}}\n!align=\"center\" class=\"alphabetical\"| Abbreviation{{efn|Abbreviation in the parentheses is informal}}\n|-\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Anhui|Anhui Province]]                   |{{zh|labels=no|s=\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701}}|\u0100nhu\u012b Sh\u011bng   |{{lang|zh|\u7696}}  |CN-AH|9696ff| |[[Hefei]]       | 59,500,510| 425.91|139,700|AH|W\u01cen}}\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Beijing|Beijing Municipality]]|{{zh|labels=no|s=\u5317\u4eac\u5e02}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u5317\u4eac\u5e02}}|B\u011bij\u012bng Sh\u00ec|{{lang|zh|\u4eac}}|CN-BJ|ff8585||''Beijing''|19,612,368|1,167.40|16,800|BJ|J\u012bng}}\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Chongqing|Chongqing Municipality]]           |\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02|\u91cd\u6176\u5e02|Ch\u00f3ngq\u00ecng Sh\u00ec|{{lang|zh|\u6e1d}}    |CN-CQ|ff8585| |''Chongqing''| 28,846,170| 350.50|82,300|CQ|Y\u00fa}}\n|- style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"{{tent division chn 1|[[Fujian|Fujian Province]]{{efn|Most of the Fujian Province is administered by the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] while the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (ROC)]] retains control of the [[Kinmen County]] (Quemoy) and [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang County]] (Matsu) under its own streamlined [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]].}}|{{zh|labels=no|s=\u798f\u5efa\u7701}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5efa\u7701}}|F\u00faji\u00e0n Sh\u011bng  |{{lang|zh|\u95fd}}  |CN-FJ|9696ff| |[[Fuzhou]] (PRC)<br>[[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng]] (ROC){{efn|The [[Fujian Provincial Government]] was formed on 1 May 1927 and the provincial government was relocated from [[Fuzhou|Foochow]] to Kinmen, then [[Xindian District|Hsintien Township]] and [[New Taipei City|Taipei County]] within [[Taiwan Province]] in 1956 before moving back to Kinmen on 15 January 1996.

However, China lost four provinces with the establishment of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]] in 1945, China re-incorporated Manchuria as 10 provinces, and assumed control of Taiwan as a province. As a result, the Republic of China in 1946 had 35 provinces. Although the Republic of China now only controls one province ([[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]), and some islands of a second province ([[Fujian]]), it continues to formally claim all 35 provinces

In 1929, Vassiliou held his first individual exhibition, and in 1930 he was awarded the Benaki Prize for his design of Saint Dionysios Church in Kolonaki, Athens.

He represented Greece at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1934 and 1964, exhibited in Alexandria in 1957, and at the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial]] in 1959. In 1955 he designed and painted the interior of Saint Konstantinos Orthodox church of Detroit. In 1960 his autobiographical work, Lights & Shadows, was exhibited in the [[Solomon R.

He paid homage to the Byzantine icon by floating symbols of everyday Greek life on washes of gold or sea-blue color, very much like the religious symbols that float on gold in religious art.

Works such as ''The Burial of Palamas'' and ''The Mourning of the Kalavrytans'' (1943) became famous in Greece as symbols of freedom.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.
