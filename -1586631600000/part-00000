He studied painting and drawing with Jo Weiss, Lee Newman, [[Jack Boul]], and David Holt at the Washington Studio School, [[Washington, D.C.]], from 1987 to 1988, and attended graduate school in fine arts at [[Parsons School of Design]], [[New York City]].<ref>http://www.mitchelljohnson.com/</ref>\n \nDuring graduate school,  Johnson supported himself doing odd jobs for various New York artists, most notably [[Frank Stella]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Sandy Skoglund]], sculptor [[Abram Schlemowitz]] and Frank Stella's assistant, Earl Childress.  In the fall of 1990, while waiting to hear if he would be able to join LeWitt's Wall Drawing Team, Johnson was offered a studio assistant job with [[Sam Francis]] and this is what landed him in Palo Alto.  He has since divided his time between California and Europe.\n\nIn 2007 he was an artist-in-residence at the [[Josef Albers|Josef]] and [[Anni Albers]] Foundation in [[Bethany, Connecticut]].  Johnson is a 2015 Visiting Artist at the American Academy in Rome and the subject of a short documentary film, The Artist of Silicon Valley, by Meg Smaker. His paintings can be found in over 700 private collections and the permanent collections of 28 museums.  The most recent museum acquisitions were the [[Museo Morandi]] in [[Bologna]], [[Galleria D'Arte Moderna]] in Rome and the [[Tucson Museum of Art]].

He studied painting and drawing with Jo Weiss, Lee Newman, [[Jack Boul]], and David Holt at the Washington Studio School, [[Washington, D.C.]], from 1987 to 1988, and attended graduate school in fine arts at [[Parsons School of Design]], [[New York City]].<ref>http://www.mitchelljohnson.com/</ref>\n \nDuring graduate school,  Johnson supported himself doing odd jobs for various New York artists, most notably [[Frank Stella]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Sandy Skoglund]] and Stella's assistant, Earl Childress.  In the fall of 1990, while waiting to hear if he would be able to join LeWitt's Wall Drawing Team, Johnson was offered a studio assistant job with [[Sam Francis]] and this is what landed him in Palo Alto.  He has since divided his time between California and Europe.\n\nIn 2007 he was an artist-in-residence at the [[Josef Albers|Josef]] and [[Anni Albers]] Foundation in [[Bethany, Connecticut]].  Johnson is a 2015 Visiting Artist at the American Academy in Rome and the subject of a short documentary film, The Artist of Silicon Valley, by Meg Smaker. His paintings can be found in over 700 private collections and the permanent collections of 28 museums.  The most recent museum acquisitions were the [[Museo Morandi]] in [[Bologna]], [[Galleria D'Arte Moderna]] in Rome and the [[Tucson Museum of Art]]. Johnson's paintings have appeared regularly in the New York Times Magazine since 2012. His work has been the subject of solo-exhibitions in Milan, New York, Santa Fe, San Francisco, Los Angeles, St. Helena, Oakland, Portland, and Scottsdale.

It was based on the [[Soyuz 7K-OK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/soyuz7k-l1.html|title=Soyuz 7K-L1|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> Several modifications reduced vehicle mass and increased circumlunar capability. The most notable modifications were the replacement of the orbital module with a support cone and a high-gain parabolic antenna, the removal of a reserve parachute, and the addition of the gyro platform and star navigation sensors for the far space navigation. The spacecraft was capable of carrying two [[cosmonauts]]. At the start of flight testing, there were serious reliability problems with the new [[Proton rocket]], the 7K-L1, and the Soyuz 7K-OK that the L1 was based on.\n\n==History==\nChief Designer [[Sergei Korolev]] had originally envisioned a crewed lunar spacecraft launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit. The development of [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s large UR-500 booster theoretically made it possible to do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing for lunar spacecraft, the LK-1, and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft but concealed his true intentions by billing it as an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a crewed lunar spacecraft, which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a [[UR-500]] topped with the [[Blok D]] stage under development by the [[OKB-1]] Bureau.\n\nKorolev originally intended to piece together the lunar Soyuz in Earth orbit because he did not believe the [[UR-500]] was powerful enough to launch the full vehicle or that it wouldn't be safe for the crew. However, when he died in January 1966, his successor as head of OKB-1, [[Vasily Mishin]], argued that it was definitely possible to strip down the Soyuz enough to launch it with the [[Proton (rocket family)|UR-500]].\n\nWith the first four uncrewed test starts (see below) being partially successful or unsuccessful, including two under the common open name \"[[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]]\" as for any Soviet test spacecraft, the mission of 2\u20137 March 1968 and subsequent ones were the flights of the L1 spacecraft under the open designation \"[[Zond program|Zond]]\" that were given by Soviets for test missions to far space.\n\nAfter the successful United States [[Apollo 8]] crewed flight around the Moon, the Soviet crewed Moon-flyby missions lost political motivation. The first crewed flight of the L1/Zond spacecraft with [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valery Bykovsky]] planned for the end of 1970 was cancelled. In addition, the Proton booster was far from being [[Human-rating_certification|human-rated]] and its poor launch record made it undesirable for crewed flights.\n\nAll L1/Zond spacecraft made only uncrewed flights from 1967\u20131970, from ([[Zond 4]] to [[Zond 8]]), and four of these [[Zond failed missions|five Zond flights]] suffered malfunctions. Test flights conducted around the Moon showed problems using their star sensors for navigation. These problems caused ballistic reentry due to failed guidance. One direct descent re-entry was performed on a steep ballistic trajectory with a deceleration of up to 20 Gs and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Three others performed a maneuver known as \"[[skip reentry]]\" to shed velocity. One of those also performed an unsafe (for humans) descent of up to 20 Gs of deceleration, the other suffered main parachute failure, and only one flight - [[Zond 7]] - would have been safe for cosmonauts.\n\nInstrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on [[micrometeor]] flux, solar and [[cosmic ray]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, radio emissions, and [[solar wind]]. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. [[Zond 5]] was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return them relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn't affect the tortoises' health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterward.<ref name=\"NK\">http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/252/43.shtml (in Russian)</ref>\n\nTwo modifications of main Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" version was created: the powered (up to 7000 kg mass) [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] \"Zond-M\" that were failed attempted to launch for Moon flyby on [[N1 rocket]] two times due to [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ship-module of L3 lunar expedition complex was not ready; the [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] \"Zond-LOK\" as dummy mockup of Soyuz 7K-LOK and were successfully launched on [[Low Earth Orbit]] on [[Proton rocket]] as [[Kosmos 382]] and failed launched for Moon orbiting on third [[N1 rocket]].\n\nNo official name for crewed Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" was adopted. According to [[Vasily Mishin|Mishin]]'s and [[Nikolai Kamanin|Kamanin]]'s memoirs, the names \"Rodina\" (''motherland''), \"Ural\" (''[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] mountains''), \"Akademik Korolyov\" (''academician [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]]''). Also, \"Zarya\" (''dawn'') and \"Znamya\" (''banner'') were proposed for both lunar Soyuz 7K-L1 flyby and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ships. The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the L1 was called \"Saturn\" and featured some differences from the standard 7K-OK \"Sirius-7K\" IDS.\n\nAlong with the remaining 7K-L1S, the Soviet Moon-flyby program was closed in 1970 without the achievement of its crewed primary goal. The intended crewed use of L1/Zond spacecraft was documented in official Soviet sources for the first time but from 1968 until 1989 this and the Moon-landing [[N1-L3]] programs were classified and the Soviet government denied the existence of both. Near 1968 a rare open Soviet source ([[Big Soviet Encyclopedia]]'s Yearbook, Kosmonavtika small encyclopedia) sporadically referred to Zond's as tests of ''space ships'' for lunar missions in contrast to the ''space apparate'' term used by the Soviets for spacecraft not capable of carrying a crew.\n\n==Planned schedule==\n[[File:Proton-L1 (Zond) drawing.png|thumb|Proton 7K-L1 launch vehicle configuration]]\n\nAs of 1967, the Soyuz 7K-L1 launch schedule was:\n\nMission\n* 2P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 3P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 4L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - May 1967 (actually launched on 27 September 1967, booster failure)\n* 5L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - June 1967 (actually launched on 22 November 1967, booster failure)\n* 6L           - Crewed lunar flyby   - June or July 1767\n* 7L and 8L    - Crewed lunar flybys  - August 1967 (7L actually launched on 23 April 1968, as [[Zond 1968A]], booster failure; 8L actually launched on 21 July 1968, booster explosion)\n* 9L and 10L   - Crewed lunar flybys  - September 1967 (10L planned to launch as [[Zond 9]], cancelled)\n* 11L and 12L  - Crewed lunar flybys  - October 1967\n* 13L          - Reserve spacecraft (actually launched on 20 January 1969, as [[Zond 1969A]], booster failure)\n\nIn July 1968, it was proposed that L1 spacecraft would be launched every month, and the first crewed mission would be in December 1968 or January 1969 after 3 or 4 successful uncrewed flights.

It was based on the [[Soyuz 7K-OK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/soyuz7k-l1.html|title=Soyuz 7K-L1|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> Several modifications reduced vehicle mass and increased circumlunar capability. The most notable modifications were the replacement of the orbital module with a support cone and a high-gain parabolic antenna, the removal of a reserve parachute, and the addition of the gyro platform and star navigation sensors for the far space navigation. The spacecraft was capable of carrying two [[cosmonauts]]. At the start of flight testing, there were serious reliability problems with the new [[Proton rocket]], the 7K-L1, and the Soyuz 7K-OK that the L1 was based on.\n\n==History==\nChief Designer [[Sergei Korolev]] had originally envisioned a crewed lunar spacecraft launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit. The development of [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s large UR-500 booster theoretically made it possible to do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing for lunar spacecraft, the LK-1, and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft but concealed his true intentions by billing it as an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a crewed lunar spacecraft, which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a [[UR-500]] topped with the [[Blok D]] stage under development by the [[OKB-1]] Bureau.\n\nKorolev originally intended to piece together the lunar Soyuz in Earth orbit because he did not believe the [[UR-500]] was powerful enough to launch the full vehicle or that it wouldn't be safe for the crew. However, when he died in January 1966, his successor as head of OKB-1, [[Vasily Mishin]], argued that it was definitely possible to strip down the Soyuz enough to launch it with the [[Proton (rocket family)|UR-500]].\n\nWith the first four uncrewed test starts (see below) being partially successful or unsuccessful, including two under the common open name \"[[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]]\" as for any Soviet test spacecraft, the mission of 2\u20137 March 1968 and subsequent ones were the flights of the L1 spacecraft under the open designation \"[[Zond program|Zond]]\" that were given by Soviets for test missions to far space.\n\nAfter the successful United States [[Apollo 8]] crewed flight around the Moon, the Soviet crewed Moon-flyby missions lost political motivation. The first crewed flight of the L1/Zond spacecraft with [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valery Bykovsky]] planned for the end of 1970 was cancelled. In addition, the Proton booster was far from being [[Human-rating_certification|human-rated]] and its poor launch record made it undesirable for crewed flights.\n\nAll L1/Zond spacecraft made only uncrewed flights from 1967\u20131970, from ([[Zond 4]] to [[Zond 8]]), and four of these [[Zond failed missions|five Zond flights]] suffered malfunctions. Test flights conducted around the Moon showed problems using their star sensors for navigation. These problems caused ballistic reentry due to failed guidance. One direct descent re-entry was performed on a steep ballistic trajectory with a deceleration of up to 20 Gs and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Three others performed a maneuver known as \"[[skip reentry]]\" to shed velocity. One of those also performed an unsafe (for humans) descent of up to 20 Gs of deceleration, the other suffered main parachute failure, and only one flight - [[Zond 7]] - would have been safe for cosmonauts.\n\nInstrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on [[micrometeor]] flux, solar and [[cosmic ray]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, radio emissions, and [[solar wind]]. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. [[Zond 5]] was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return them relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn't affect the tortoises' health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterward.<ref name=\"NK\">http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/252/43.shtml (in Russian)</ref>\n\nTwo modifications of main Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" version was created: the powered (up to 7000 kg mass) [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] \"Zond-M\" that were failed attempted to launch for Moon flyby on [[N1 rocket]] two times due to [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ship-module of L3 lunar expedition complex was not ready; the [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] \"Zond-LOK\" as dummy mockup of Soyuz 7K-LOK and were successfully launched on [[Low Earth Orbit]] on [[Proton rocket]] as [[Kosmos 382]] and failed launched for Moon orbiting on third [[N1 rocket]].\n\nNo official name for crewed Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" was adopted. According to [[Vasily Mishin|Mishin]]'s and [[Nikolai Kamanin|Kamanin]]'s memoirs, the names \"Rodina\" (''motherland''), \"Ural\" (''[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] mountains''), \"Akademik Korolyov\" (''academician [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]]''). Also, \"Zarya\" (''dawn'') and \"Znamya\" (''banner'') were proposed for both lunar Soyuz 7K-L1 flyby and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ships. The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the L1 was called \"Saturn\" and featured some differences from the standard 7K-OK \"Sirius-7K\" IDS.\n\nAlong with the remaining 7K-L1S, the Soviet Moon-flyby program was closed in 1970 without the achievement of its crewed primary goal.

The British thought the agreement was to stop the weapons searches that involved going into the houses of local inhabitants.\n\nAt first, angry locals stoned the Paras whilst being encouraged by anti-British rhetoric being chanted from microphones on minarets in the town. The Paras used rubber bullets to try and bring the situation under control, followed by conflicted reports about who fired the first live shots; this led to street battles, rifle fire and the cornering of six [[Royal Military Police]]men (RMP) in the police station at Majar al-Kabir. The six RMP were killed by an angry mob of up to 600 people whilst maintaining a defensive position within the police station. Four Iraqi civilians were killed and at least eleven more were injured during the riot that led to the RMP personnel being cornered. The number of British troops injured numbered eight, though only one was injured through being in a firefight in the town.\n\nA Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was deployed from [[Camp Abu Naji]] and air support came in the form of one [[Gazelle helicopter|Gazelle]] and one [[Chinook helicopter|Chinook]] helicopter. The Chinook incurred enough airframe damage from Iraqi gunfire that it could not land its QRF element in the town and had to return to Abu Naji where it offloaded seven seriously injured troops.\n\nThe death of the six RMP was one of the most controversial occurrences of the [[Iraq War|Iraq Campaign]] involving British forces and remains a controversial subject within political and military circles.{{sfn|Nichol|2008|p=72}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Occupation zones in Iraq September 2003.svg|thumb|Occupation zones in Iraq in September 2003]]\nIn March 2003, coalition forces started the invasion of Iraq that would become the Iraq War, lasting until 2011.{{sfn|Fulford & Leggatt|2014|p=2}} Combat operations were announced by the then-[[President of the United States]], [[George W.

Whilst most of the weapons and ammunition were removed from private houses in the region, smaller weapons, such as [[AK-47]]s and handguns, were left with the families for their own protection.

When the British arrived they found an area devoid of government officials as all the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athists]] had been chased away by the local populace in retaliation for their treatment under Saddam's regime. The region was also prone to other influences such as the [[CIA]] operating in the area. This annoyed Lieutenant-Colonel Tom Beckett (commanding officer of 1 Para) who demanded that all CIA operatives clear their routines in the 1 Para area of operations through the Ops Room at Camp Abu Naji.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=103}}\n\nBecause of the flat area in and around Majar al-Kabir, [[VHF]] and [[High frequency|HF]] communications were extremely limited.

With some men on guard duty, the rest were sunbathing and relaxing when a crowd of angry Iraqis arrived at the police station throwing rocks and chanting \"no, no, America\". In the unrest that followed, a [[DAF Trucks|DAF truck]] and the [[Land Rover Defender#Military Defenders|Land Rover]] belonging to Two-Zero Alpha were destroyed. After some warning shots were fired by the British, including one plastic bullet which deflected off the ground and hit a protester in the face,{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|pp=55-56}} a [[Quick Reaction Force]] (QRF) was activated and they arrived in [[FV107 Scimitar|Scimitars]] and armed Land Rovers to push back the crowd.{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|pp=13-14}}\n\n==Battle==\nOn the morning of the battle, a support company platoon had driven through the town and when they reached Camp Abu Naji, they described the area as being \"eerily quiet\"{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=296}} and those locals that were out on the streets giving them \"death stares\".{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=10}}\n\n===Alpha and Bravo Company===\nAlpha and Bravo Company, both of 8 Platoon, [[1 Para]], arrived in Majar al-Kabir at 9:25&nbsp;am on 24 June with the intention of carrying out foot patrols through the town.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=110}} Before leaving, Lieutenant Ross Kennedy (the Officer in Command (OIC) of the two companies) asked for more baton rounds (plastic bullets) for his baton gun. The request was denied as all the spare rounds were packed away before the Parachute Regiment left the area to return to the UK in seven days time. This left his two patrols (Alpha and Bravo) with only 13 baton rounds. {{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=56}}At just after 10:00&nbsp;am local time, the local Iraqi militia commander (Talal Abid Ahmed Zubaida){{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=283}} drove up to the patrol and stopped them from going further. Zubaida told them that the town was dangerous and that they would be shot at. Lieutenant Kennedy offered to change the route of the patrol, but Zubaida warned him that the route was an issue too and that if he went into the town, it would have to be without Zubaida's militia.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=29}} The British managed to negotiate a vehicle-mounted patrol through the town as a compromise with Zubaida. Alpha Company would remain at the Militia headquarters with other vehicles{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=16}} whilst the Iraqi Militia would accompany Bravo, mounted on [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]], on a patrol through the town; the British felt that not to have patrolled would be a sign of weakness.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=110}} At 10:10&nbsp;am, Bravo company entered the town and almost immediately were showered with rocks thrown by \"smiling locals.\"{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=111-112}}\n\nAt 10:25&nbsp;am, Bravo Company de-bussed as the Iraqis were swarming around them and the ringleaders in the crowd were encouraging the locals to attack Bravo Company. As they de-bussed to throw back the crowd, the rear vehicle noticed that the Iraqi Militia contingent were no longer in the convoy.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=114}} Such was the intensity of the rock throwing and the sheer numbers of locals in the crowd, Bravo took the decision to fire rubber bullets at the ringleaders. Whilst the soldiers were well aware that using rubber bullets could either calm or inflame a situation,{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=114-115}} they felt that they had no choice given the intensity of the crowd, who were being told via the loudspeakers on the minarets{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=141}} that the British were here to \"rape the women [and] attack them!\"{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=110-115}} One of the ringleaders was identified, and a corporal using the baton gun fired and felled the ringleader from {{convert|20|ft}} away.{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=58}} After two more baton rounds were fired, the crowd surged forward and the [[Non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) of Bravo Company (Sgt Gordon Robertson) fired warning shots into the air from his rifle and other troops followed suit. At this the crowd moved back and allowed them space to move, but it was later realized that the local Iraqis had gone to get their weapons. In their minds, the British had fired first, so it was a matter of pride that they returned fire.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=116}} At 10:30&nbsp;am, Iraqi gunmen would return fire and Bravo would defend themselves with the result of the first Iraqis dying.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=117}} One witness in the crowd claimed that children were throwing stones at the Paratroopers and when one of the paratroopers went into a firing position, a local man called Tassir thought a child would be shot, so he levelled his weapon at the paratroopers. The British troops fired on him first as they thought he was going to shoot, and after that, the crowd became completely hostile.<ref name=\":IND2:\" /> At this point, the RMP patrol was only {{convert|200|m}} away from the Paratroopers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Norton-Taylor|first1=Richard|title=British military police deaths in Iraq 'could have been avoided'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/18/iraq.military|accessdate=6 July 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 November 2004}}</ref> Ahmed Younis, a member of the crowd on the morning, said <blockquote>The market was very crowded. I threw myself on the ground and shouted to everyone to run away or get down. The shooting lasted about five minutes but there were bullets going everywhere. They were firing on automatic. I couldn't believe it when they started shooting.</blockquote> Sheikh Shejar said <blockquote> The Iraqi side fired first. Later they went to the police station and attacked there. The mob wanted to shelter at the police station and use it as a base to attack the British.{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|pp=17-18}}</blockquote>\n\nBack at the Militia Headquarters, whilst Alpha Company were crouched down behind their vehicles dodging the rocks being thrown at them by an angry crowd,{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|pp=16-17}} they were able to distinguish between the sound of rounds being fired from an AK-47 and an SA-80 rifle by their relative pitches.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=118}} They realized that Bravo were under fire and returning fire themselves. Without communications, Alpha mounted up and drove into the town having to guess where Bravo would be by the sound of the gunfire.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=118-119}} Alpha came under sustained and heavy fire at a crossroads {{convert|100|m}} from the police station. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) under these conditions is to de-bus. The troops from Alpha spread out with some taking cover under their DAF truck. Despite the short distance and the availability of line of sight, no members of Alpha had seen or recognized the Land Rovers of the RMP patrol at the police station,{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=121}} though at that point, the Land Rovers may have been moved inside the police station compound.{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=17}} Alpha suppressed the enemy fire, but the DAF truck needed to be jump-started due to mechanical problems.<ref group=\"note\">The DAF's engine was problematic and the coalition fuel used, JP8, often disagreed with the engine.</ref>{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=123}} With some troops providing cover, the rest of Alpha pushed the truck until it started. They then mounted up and sped north whilst being targeted by gunmen{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=124-125}} but managed to reach a point of safety north of the town. They de-bussed and took up defensive positions whilst the [[sitrep]] was phoned in to the Ops Room back at Abu Naji.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=128-129}}\n\nMeanwhile, Bravo were looking for an exit. As they were attacked from the front and had to stop, Sgt Gordon Robertson managed to reach the Ops Room at Camp Abu Naji and relay their situation. Whilst at this point Bravo had no casualties, they did need an ammunition re-supply and were eager to know Alpha Company's location and situation.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=127-128}} Whilst engaged in heavy fighting, Bravo lost one of their Pinzgauers to an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] round which had detonated the fuel tank.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=138}} A few minutes later and the second Pinzgauer was on fire and Bravo were having to fight through the streets to get to cover.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=144-145}}\n\nAlpha mounted back up at 10:50&nbsp;am to drive back into town and try to assist Bravo Company. This request had come from the Ops Room and had been worded carefully so as not to sound like an order; only the commander on the ground could assess whether or not Alpha could be of any use.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp136-137}} As they expected, they came under contact with heavy fire almost immediately and they had to de-bus from the DAF truck. An RPG was fired at the truck, but was deflected just in front of the vehicle by an electricity cable.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=142}}\n\nAt this time (between 11:00 and 11:15&nbsp;am), Alpha, Bravo and the six RMP personnel were within {{convert|400|m}} of each other, but unable to communicate or group together;{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=145}} Alpha and Bravo Companies were completely unaware that the RMPs were even in the town and vice versa, even though they had all gone through the same Ops Room that morning.{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=16}} An [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] (AAC) [[Gazelle helicopter|Gazelle]] helicopter was dispatched to act as a re-broadcast unit between Alpha, Bravo and the Ops Room. Critically, it had also been given orders for a fly-over of the police station to determine if the six RMP NCOs were still there.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=150}} At 11:05&nbsp;am, a Chinook with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was deployed from Abu Naji to go into Majar al-Kabir and support Bravo Company.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=299}}\n\nAt about 11:15&nbsp;am, Bravo entered a house in the town to take cover. The Iraqi family who lived in the house were told to lie on the floor; not because they were hostages, but for their own safety in case anyone outside had seen Bravo entering and tried to shoot into the house.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=154}} Alpha were pinned down by effective fire {{convert|500|m}} from the police station on the northern side of town. The Officer in Charge (OIC) of Alpha, [[Lieutenant]] Ross Kennedy, was being targeted by a sniper, and so the decision was made to hold until the QRF (Quick Reaction Force) arrived from Abu Naji to help.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=157}} Bravo deployed mini-flares on the roof of the house that they were occupying to alert the Chinook to their presence. Unfortunately, because of damage and casualties, the Chinook had to return to Abu Naji. The setting off of the mini-flares did alert the Iraqi gunmen to Bravo's position, who now found themselves having to shoot out of the house at the armed Iraqis clambering over the walls to get to them.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=172-173}} At 11:30&nbsp;am, Bravo split into two sections so that one section stayed behind and provided covering fire for the other section. They manoeuvred and fired in turn until both sections met up again to form just one. Bravo managed to get clear just as the mob had encircled the house they were in.{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=61}} Bravo maintained a northwards direction along an irrigation ditch, which slowed them down because of the mud that was sticking to their boots. They could hear the engines of the Scimitars and the Land Rovers of the QRF. Sgt Robertson launched mini-flares to alert the QRF to his position, but he was unable to know if the QRF had seen them. Therefore, Private Freddy Ellis was tasked to cover {{convert|400|m}}{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=61}} of dead ground between them and the QRF wagons. Ellis stripped off his webbing and ran, zigzagging all the way to the QRF column to relate the position of Bravo Company.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=190-191}}\n\nA Manoeuvre Support Group (MSG) with armed Land Rovers<ref group=\"note\">The armed Land Rovers are known as WMIKs - Weapon Mounted Installation Kit.

This done, the column of vehicles sped into town and arrived about 11:38&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=182}} They came under fire almost immediately from AK-47s, and as they returned fire (using the .50 cal Browning) they noticed Alpha Company in the ditches to their east.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=184}} By 12:00&nbsp;pm, all known soldiers on the ground had been accounted for and an update had been passed to the Ops Room back at Abu Naji. However, at that time, Doctor Firas Fasal, an Iraqi doctor who was working at the hospital in the town, had approached the ICP north of the town to inform the OIC (Major Kemp) that there was four British Hostages in the police station.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=194}}\n\n===The Chinook and air support===\nAs part of a multi-pronged approach to a rescue, a [[Chinook helicopter|Chinook]] helicopter of [[No. 27 Squadron RAF]] was mobilised from Abu Naji to Majar al-Kabir with a quick reaction force on board. The helicopter lifted off at 11:05&nbsp;am and returned to Abu Naji around 11:30&nbsp;am<ref group=\"note\">The flight time to Majar al-Kabir was estimated to be around 8 minutes time; 16 minutes for the round trip.</ref> after coming under sustained fire and having at least seven casualties aboard, who were wounded by the insurgent fire.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=299}} The helicopters' route into the town meant it having to fly over the rooftops to try and locate Bravo Company who were holed up in one of the houses. Whilst it flew in low, it made itself a target for small arms fire and RPGs, with no less than six RPGs being fired at the helicopter. As the damage to the helicopter was severe and casualties were mounting, the pilot, [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Guy Van den Berg, decided that safest option was to return to base. The Sergeant in charge of the QRF asked that the helicopter land away from the immediate danger and allow the non-wounded on board to disembark. Van den Berg replied that if the Chinook landed, it might not get off the ground again.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=165-167}}\n\nWhen the Chinook arrived back at Abu Naji, the wounded were taken off and some, after [[Triage|triaging]] and emergency first aid, were reloaded back onto the Chinook for onward transfer to a more secure medical facility. With its rotors still running, (turning and burning) the RAF ground crew were assessing the damage to the airframe. The helicopter had at least 100 holes in its fuselage and one shot had missed the gearbox by less than {{convert|3|in}}; if it had penetrated the gearbox, it would have meant that the helicopter would have crashed.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=188-189}} The cockpit and pilot seats on the helicopter were armour protected, but the rest of the airframe was not.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/83819/rmp_boi.pdf|title=Board of Inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the deaths of....Al Majarr Al Kabir[sic] 24 June 2003|work=gov.uk|date=19 October 2004|page=53|access-date=27 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nClose air support was limited to two [[F-15 Eagle]] aircraft flown by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF).

However, the Ops Room could not get in communication with any [[Forward Air Controller]]s (FACs) on the ground, so the two aircraft buzzed over the town, very low and very fast.

Despite a signed agreement between local people and British forces stating that the British would not enter the town, the [[1st Battalion Parachute Regiment]] started patrolling in the town of Majar al-Kabir on 24 June 2003 the day after the agreement was signed by both sides. The British thought the agreement was to stop the weapons searches that involved going into the houses of local inhabitants.\n\nAt first, angry locals stoned the Paras whilst being encouraged by anti-British rhetoric being chanted from microphones on minarets in the town. The Paras used rubber bullets to try and bring the situation under control; this led to street battles, rifle fire and the cornering of six [[Royal Military Police]]men (RMP) in the police station at Majar al-Kabir. The six RMP were killed by an angry mob of up to 600 people whilst maintaining a defensive position within the police station. Four Iraqi civilians were killed and at least eleven more were injured during the riot that led to the RMP personnel being cornered. The number of British troops injured numbered eight, though only one was injured through being in a firefight in the town.\n\nA Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was deployed from [[Camp Abu Naji]] and air support came in the form of one [[Gazelle helicopter|Gazelle]] and one [[Chinook helicopter|Chinook]] helicopter. The Chinook incurred enough airframe damage from Iraqi gunfire that it could not land its QRF element in the town and had to return to Abu Naji where it offloaded seven seriously injured troops.\n\nThe death of the six RMP was one of the most controversial occurrences of the [[Iraq War|Iraq Campaign]] involving British forces and remains a controversial subject within political and military circles.{{sfn|Nichol|2008|p=72}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Occupation zones in Iraq September 2003.svg|thumb|Occupation zones in Iraq in September 2003]]\nIn March 2003, coalition forces started the invasion of Iraq that would become the Iraq War, lasting until 2011.{{sfn|Fulford & Leggatt|2014|p=2}} Combat operations were announced by the then-[[President of the United States]], [[George W.

In the unrest that followed, a [[DAF Trucks|DAF truck]] and the [[Land Rover Defender#Military Defenders|Land Rover]] belonging to Two-Zero Alpha were destroyed. After some warning shots were fired by the British, including one plastic bullet which deflected off the ground and hit a protester in the face,{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|pp=55-56}} a [[Quick Reaction Force]] (QRF) was activated and they arrived in [[FV107 Scimitar|Scimitars]] and armed Land Rovers to push back the crowd.{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|pp=13-14}}\n\n==Battle==\nOn the morning of the battle, a support company platoon had driven through the town and when they reached Camp Abu Naji, they described the area as being \"eerily quiet\"{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=296}} and those locals that were out on the streets giving them \"death stares\".{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=10}}\n\n===Alpha and Bravo Company===\nAlpha and Bravo Company, both of 8 Platoon, [[1 Para]], arrived in Majar al-Kabir at 9:25&nbsp;am on 24 June with the intention of carrying out foot patrols through the town.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=110}} Before leaving, Lieutenant Ross Kennedy (the Officer in Command (OIC) of the two companies) asked for more baton rounds (plastic bullets) for his baton gun.

This left his two patrols (Alpha and Bravo) with only 13 baton rounds. {{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=56}}At just after 10:00&nbsp;am local time, the local Iraqi militia commander (Talal Abid Ahmed Zubaida){{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=283}} drove up to the patrol and stopped them from going further.

Alpha Company would remain at the Militia headquarters with other vehicles{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=16}} whilst the Iraqi Militia would accompany Bravo, mounted on [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]], on a patrol through the town; the British felt that not to have patrolled would be a sign of weakness.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=110}} At 10:10&nbsp;am, Bravo company entered the town and almost immediately were showered with rocks thrown by \"smiling locals.\"{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=111-112}}\n\nAt 10:25&nbsp;am, Bravo Company de-bussed as the Iraqis were swarming around them and the ringleaders in the crowd were encouraging the locals to attack Bravo Company.

Whilst the soldiers were well aware that using rubber bullets could either calm or inflame a situation,{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=114-115}} they felt that they had no choice given the intensity of the crowd, who were being told via the loudspeakers on the minarets{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=141}} that the British were here to \"rape the women [and] attack them!\"{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=110-115}} One of the ringleaders was identified, and a corporal using the baton gun fired and felled the ringleader from {{convert|20|ft}} away.{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=58}} After two more baton rounds were fired, the crowd surged forward and the [[Non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) of Bravo Company (Sgt Gordon Robertson) fired warning shots into the air from his rifle and other troops followed suit. At this the crowd moved back and allowed them space to move, but it was later realized that the local Iraqis had gone to get their weapons. In their minds, the British had fired first, so it was a matter of pride that they returned fire.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=116}} At 10:30&nbsp;am, Iraqi gunmen would return fire and Bravo would defend themselves with the result of the first Iraqis dying.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=117}} One witness in the crowd claimed that children were throwing stones at the Paratroopers and when one of the paratroopers went into a firing position, a local man called Tassir thought a child would be shot, so he levelled his weapon at the paratroopers.

Without communications, Alpha mounted up and drove into the town having to guess where Bravo would be by the sound of the gunfire.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=118-119}} Alpha came under sustained and heavy fire at a crossroads {{convert|100|m}} from the police station. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) under these conditions is to de-bus. The troops from Alpha spread out with some taking cover under their DAF truck. Despite the short distance and the availability of line of sight, no members of Alpha had seen or recognized the Land Rovers of the RMP patrol at the police station,{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=121}} though at that point, the Land Rovers may have been moved inside the police station compound.{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=17}} Alpha suppressed the enemy fire, but the DAF truck needed to be jump-started due to mechanical problems.<ref group=\"note\">The DAF's engine was problematic and the coalition fuel used, JP8, often disagreed with the engine.</ref>{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=123}} With some troops providing cover, the rest of Alpha pushed the truck until it started. They then mounted up and sped north whilst being targeted by gunmen{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=124-125}} but managed to reach a point of safety north of the town. They de-bussed and took up defensive positions whilst the [[sitrep]] was phoned in to the Ops Room back at Abu Naji.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=128-129}}\n\nMeanwhile, Bravo were looking for an exit. As they were attacked from the front and had to stop, Sgt Gordon Robertson managed to reach the Ops Room at Camp Abu Naji and relay their situation. Whilst at this point Bravo had no casualties, they did need an ammunition re-supply and were eager to know Alpha Company's location and situation.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=127-128}} Whilst engaged in heavy fighting, Bravo lost one of their Pinzgauers to an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] round which had detonated the fuel tank.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=138}} A few minutes later and the second Pinzgauer was on fire and Bravo were having to fight through the streets to get to cover.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=144-145}}\n\nAlpha mounted back up at 10:50&nbsp;am to drive back into town and try to assist Bravo Company. This request had come from the Ops Room and had been worded carefully so as not to sound like an order; only the commander on the ground could assess whether or not Alpha could be of any use.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp136-137}} As they expected, they came under contact with heavy fire almost immediately and they had to de-bus from the DAF truck. An RPG was fired at the truck, but was deflected just in front of the vehicle by an electricity cable.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=142}}\n\nAt this time (between 11:00 and 11:15&nbsp;am), Alpha, Bravo and the six RMP personnel were within {{convert|400|m}} of each other, but unable to communicate or group together;{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=145}} Alpha and Bravo Companies were completely unaware that the RMPs were even in the town and vice versa, even though they had all gone through the same Ops Room that morning.{{sfn|Lawrence|2006|p=16}} An [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] (AAC) [[Gazelle helicopter|Gazelle]] helicopter was dispatched to act as a re-broadcast unit between Alpha, Bravo and the Ops Room. Critically, it had also been given orders for a fly-over of the police station to determine if the six RMP NCOs were still there.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=150}} At 11:05&nbsp;am, a Chinook with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was deployed from Abu Naji to go into Majar al-Kabir and support Bravo Company.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=299}}\n\nAt about 11:15&nbsp;am, Bravo entered a house in the town to take cover. The Iraqi family who lived in the house were told to lie on the floor; not because they were hostages, but for their own safety in case anyone outside had seen Bravo entering and tried to shoot into the house.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=154}} Alpha were pinned down by effective fire {{convert|500|m}} from the police station on the northern side of town. The Officer in Charge (OIC) of Alpha, [[Lieutenant]] Ross Kennedy, was being targeted by a sniper, and so the decision was made to hold until the QRF (Quick Reaction Force) arrived from Abu Naji to help.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=157}} Bravo deployed mini-flares on the roof of the house that they were occupying to alert the Chinook to their presence. Unfortunately, because of damage and casualties, the Chinook had to return to Abu Naji. The setting off of the mini-flares did alert the Iraqi gunmen to Bravo's position, who now found themselves having to shoot out of the house at the armed Iraqis clambering over the walls to get to them.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=172-173}} At 11:30&nbsp;am, Bravo split into two sections so that one section stayed behind and provided covering fire for the other section. They manoeuvred and fired in turn until both sections met up again to form just one. Bravo managed to get clear just as the mob had encircled the house they were in.{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=61}} Bravo maintained a northwards direction along an irrigation ditch, which slowed them down because of the mud that was sticking to their boots. They could hear the engines of the Scimitars and the Land Rovers of the QRF. Sgt Robertson launched mini-flares to alert the QRF to his position, but he was unable to know if the QRF had seen them. Therefore, Private Freddy Ellis was tasked to cover {{convert|400|m}}{{sfn|Fairweather|2012|p=61}} of dead ground between them and the QRF wagons. Ellis stripped off his webbing and ran, zigzagging all the way to the QRF column to relate the position of Bravo Company.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|pp=190-191}}\n\nA Manoeuvre Support Group (MSG) with armed Land Rovers<ref group=\"note\">The armed Land Rovers are known as WMIKs - Weapon Mounted Installation Kit.

However, at that time, Doctor Firas Fasal, an Iraqi doctor who was working at the hospital in the town, had approached the ICP north of the town to inform the OIC (Major Kemp) that there was four British Hostages in the police station.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=194}}\n\n===The Chinook and air support===\nAs part of a multi-pronged approach to a rescue, a [[Chinook helicopter|Chinook]] helicopter of [[No. 27 Squadron RAF]] was mobilised from Abu Naji to Majar al-Kabir with a quick reaction force on board. The helicopter lifted off at 11:05&nbsp;am and returned to Abu Naji around 11:30&nbsp;am<ref group=\"note\">The flight time to Majar al-Kabir was estimated to be around 8 minutes time; 16 minutes for the round trip.</ref> after coming under sustained fire and having at least seven casualties aboard, who were wounded by the insurgent fire.{{sfn|Nichol|2005|p=299}} The helicopters' route into the town meant it having to fly over the rooftops to try and locate Bravo Company who were holed up in one of the houses. Whilst it flew in low, it made itself a target for small arms fire and RPGs, with no less than six RPGs being fired at the helicopter.

France gradually became forested as the glaciers retreated starting in 10,000 BC, but clearing of these primeval forests began in Neolithic times. These forests were still fairly extensive until the medieval era. \n\nIn prehistoric times, France was home to large predatory animals such as wolves and brown bears, as well as herbivores such as elk. The larger fauna have disappeared outside the Pyrenees Mountains where bears live as a protected species. Smaller animals include [[martens]], wild pigs, foxes, [[weasels]], bats, rodents, rabbits, and assorted birds.\n\nBy the 15th century, France had largely been denuded of its forests and was forced to rely on Scandinavia and their North American colonies for lumber. Significant remaining forested areas are in the Gascony region and north in the Alsace-Ardennes area. The Ardennes Forest was the scene of extensive fighting in both world wars.\n\nThe upper central part of this region is dominated by the [[Paris Basin]], which consists of a layered sequence of [[sedimentary rock]]s. Fertile soils over much of the area make good agricultural land. The [[Normandy]] coast to the upper left is characterized by high, chalk cliffs, while the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] coast (the peninsula to the left) is highly indented where deep valleys were drowned by the sea, and the [[Bay of Biscay|Biscay]] coast to the southwest is marked by flat, sandy beaches.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Naturasollieres.jpg|Forest in [[Solli\u00e8res-Sardi\u00e8res]] ([[Natura 2000]] site).\nFile:France_-_Marseille_(29878897633).jpg|[[Calanques National Park]] in [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]\nFile:Massif_du_Mont-Blanc_(hiver_panoramique).jpg|[[Mont Blanc]], the highest summit in Western Europe\n</gallery>\n\n==Political geography==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Internal divisions===\n\n[[File:D\u00e9partements+r\u00e9gions (France)-2016.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Regions and departments of Metropolitan France in 2016.]]\n{{main article|Administrative divisions of France}}\n\nFrance has several levels of internal divisions. The first-level administrative division of Integral France is regions. Besides this the French Republic has sovereignty over several other territories, with various administrative levels. \n*Metropolitan (i.e. European) France is divided into 12 ''[[R\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gions]]'' and 1 territorial collectivity, [[Corsica]]. However, Corsica is referred to as a region in common speech. These regions are subdivided into 96 ''[[d\u00e9partement]]s'', which are further divided into 332 [[arrondissements of France|arrondissements]], which are further divided into 3,879 [[Canton in France|cantons]], which are further divided into 36,568 [[Communes of France|communes]] (as of 1/1/2004).\n\n*Five overseas regions (''[[r\u00e9gion d'outre-mer|r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer]]'', or ''ROM''): [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], and [[R\u00e9union]], with identical status to metropolitan regions. Each of these overseas regions also being an overseas d\u00e9partement (''[[d\u00e9partement d'outre-mer]]'', or ''DOM''), with the same status as a ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of metropolitan France. This double structure (''r\u00e9gion''/''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'') is new, due to the recent extension of the regional scheme to the overseas d\u00e9partements, and may soon transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies. Another proposed change is that new ''d\u00e9partements'' are created such as in the case of [[R\u00e9union]], where it has been proposed to create a second ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' in the south of the island, with the ''r\u00e9gion'' of R\u00e9union above these two ''d\u00e9partements''.\n\n*Four overseas collectivities (''[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer|collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer]]'', or ''COM''): [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Saint Martin]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]. \n*One overseas \"country\" (''[[pays d'outre-mer]]'', or ''POM''): [[French Polynesia]]. In 2003 it became an overseas collectivity (or ''COM'').

France gradually became forested as the glaciers retreated starting in 10,000 BC, but clearing of these primeval forests began in Neolithic times. These forests were still fairly extensive until the medieval era. \n\nIn prehistoric times, France was home to large predatory animals such as wolves and brown bears, as well as herbivores such as elk. The larger fauna have disappeared outside the Pyrenees Mountains where bears live as a protected species. Smaller animals include [[martens]], wild pigs, foxes, [[weasels]], bats, rodents, rabbits, and assorted birds.\n\nBy the 15th century, France had largely been denuded of its forests and was forced to rely on Scandinavia and their North American colonies for lumber. Significant remaining forested areas are in the Gascony region and north in the Alsace-Ardennes area. The Ardennes Forest was the scene of extensive fighting in both world wars.\n\nThe upper central part of this region is dominated by the [[Paris Basin]], which consists of a layered sequence of [[sedimentary rock]]s. Fertile soils over much of the area make good agricultural land. The [[Normandy]] coast to the upper left is characterized by high, chalk cliffs, while the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] coast (the peninsula to the left) is highly indented where deep valleys were drowned by the sea, and the [[Bay of Biscay|Biscay]] coast to the southwest is marked by flat, sandy beaches.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Naturasollieres.jpg|Forest in [[Solli\u00e8res-Sardi\u00e8res]] ([[Natura 2000]] site).\nFile:France_-_Marseille_(29878897633).jpg|[[Calanques National Park]] in [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]\nFile:Massif_du_Mont-Blanc_(hiver_panoramique).jpg|[[Mont Blanc]], the highest summit in Western Europe\n</gallery>\n\n==Political geography==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Internal divisions===\n\n[[File:D\u00e9partements+r\u00e9gions (France)-2016.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Regions and departments of Metropolitan France in 2016.]]\n{{main article|Administrative divisions of France}}\n\nFrance has several levels of internal divisions. The first-level administrative division of Integral France is regions. Besides this the French Republic has sovereignty over several other territories, with various administrative levels. \n*Metropolitan (i.e. European) France is divided into 12 ''[[R\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gions]]'' and 1 territorial collectivity, [[Corsica]]. However, Corsica is referred to as a region in common speech. These regions are subdivided into 96 ''[[d\u00e9partement]]s'', which are further divided into 332 [[arrondissements of France|arrondissements]], which are further divided into 3,879 [[Canton in France|cantons]], which are further divided into 36,568 [[Communes of France|communes]] (as of 1/1/2004).\n\n*Five overseas regions (''[[r\u00e9gion d'outre-mer|r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer]]'', or ''ROM''): [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], and [[R\u00e9union]], with identical status to metropolitan regions. Each of these overseas regions also being an overseas d\u00e9partement (''[[d\u00e9partement d'outre-mer]]'', or ''DOM''), with the same status as a ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of metropolitan France. This double structure (''r\u00e9gion''/''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'') is new, due to the recent extension of the regional scheme to the overseas d\u00e9partements, and may soon transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies. Another proposed change is that new ''d\u00e9partements'' are created such as in the case of [[R\u00e9union]], where it has been proposed to create a second ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' in the south of the island, with the ''r\u00e9gion'' of R\u00e9union above these two ''d\u00e9partements''.\n\n*Four overseas collectivities (''[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer|collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer]]'', or ''COM''): [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Saint Martin]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]. \n*One overseas \"country\" (''[[pays d'outre-mer]]'', or ''POM''): [[French Polynesia]]. In 2003 it became an overseas collectivity (or ''COM'').

[[Incidental music]] for the original production was written by [[Darius Milhaud]].\n\n==Plot==\nGaston, a veteran of [[World War I]], suffers from [[amnesia]] and has spent the last 18 years in a hospital trying to regain his memories. Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy.

A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate.

{"title_page": "Sexuality in India", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\nIndia has developed its discourse on sexuality differently based on its distinct regions with their own unique cultures. However, one common aspect remains: the existence of a subtle conspiracy of silence and taboos that clouds the Indian world of sexual desires and expressions. The silence towards India's rich contributions to sexuality is a repercussion of colonial rule and of the [[Bible]].<ref>Garc\u00eda-Arroya, Ana. First Indian Reprint: 2010, Alternative Sexualities in India.</ref> This shaped the attitude and opinions Indian people hold about their sexuality today; one that is hegemonically heterosexual and must aim at procreation after marriage. However, from the second half of the 20th century, several significant voices have challenged this silence imposed over sexuality and questioned the roles assigned to desires within the socio-political and artistic fields. Many recently published studies confirm the richness of India's erotic past and popular voices are now spotlighting this for the masses to know. A myriad of folk tales,<ref>Pattanaik, Devdutt. 2002. The Man Who Was A Woman And Other Queer Tales.</ref> sculptures like those in [[Khajuraho]],<ref>LINGIS, ALPHONSO. \"KHAJURAHO.\" Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal, vol. 62, no. 1, 1979, pp. 52\u201369. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41178110.</ref><ref>Allen, James Sloan. \"The Mystery of the Smiling Elephant: In the Erotic Temples of Khajuraho.\" The Georgia Review, vol. 53, no. 2, 1999, pp. 321\u2013340. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41401706.</ref> religious poetry<ref>Kidwai, Saleem and Vanita, Ruth. 2000.

India played a role in shaping understandings of sexuality, and it could be argued that one of the first pieces of literature that treated \"[[Kama]]\" as science came from the Indian subcontinent.<ref>V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, Richard F. Burton, and ibn M. 'Umar. The Kama Sutra. New York: Diadem Books, 1984. Print.</ref> It may be argued that historically, India pioneered the use of [[sexual education]] through various art forms like sculptures,<ref>Sahai, Surendra.1999. Khajuraho: The Art of Love, Prakash Book Depot</ref> paintings, and pieces of literature. As in all societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in \"self-gratification\" lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Moreover, there are distinct cultural differences seen through the course of history across India.\n\n== Ancient times ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = 200\n | footer = [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Hindu and Jain temple complex]] is famous for erotic arts. \n | image1 = Kamasutra 106.jpg\n | image2 = Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG\n |image3 = 2 Erotic Kama statues of Khajuraho Hindu Temple de Lakshmana Khajur\u00e2ho India 2013.jpg\n}}\nThe origins of the current Indian culture can be traced back to the [[Indus Valley civilisation]], which was contemporaneous with the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Sumer]]ian civilisations, around 2700 BCE. During this period, the first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]]. These ancient texts, the [[Rig Veda]] among few others, reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. The epics of ancient India, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], which may have been first composed as early as 500 BCE, had a huge effect on the [[culture of Asia]], influencing later [[History of China|Chinese]], [[History of Japan|Japanese]], [[Tibetan culture]] and [[History of Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It seems that [[polygamy]] was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice both [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] as a way of preserving dynastic succession.\n\n[[Nudity]] in art was considered acceptable in southern India, as shown by the paintings at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and the sculptures of the time. It is likely that as in most countries with [[tropical]] climates, Indians from some regions did not need to wear clothes, and other than for [[fashion]], there was no practical need to cover the upper half of the body. This is supported by historical evidence, which shows that men in many parts of ancient India mostly dressed only the lower half of their bodies with clothes and upper part of body was covered by gold and precious stones, jewellery, while women used to wear traditional sarees made of silk and expensive clothes as a symbol of their wealth.\n\nAs Indian civilisation further developed and the writing of the [[Upanishads]] around 500&nbsp;BCE, it was somewhere between the 1st and 6th centuries that the [[Kama Sutra]], originally known as Vatsyayana Kamasutram ('Vatsyayana's Aphorisms on Love'), was written.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} This philosophical work on kama shastra, or 'science of love', was intended as both an exploration of human desire, including infidelity, and a technical guide to pleasing a sexual partner within a marriage. This is not the only example of such a work in [[ancient India]], but is the most widely known in modern times. It is probably during this period that the text spread to ancient [[China]], along with [[Buddhist]] scriptures, where Chinese versions were written.\n\nIt is also during 10th century to 12th century that some of India's most famous ancient works of art were produced, often freely depicting romantic themes and situations. Examples of this include the depiction of [[Apsaras]], roughly equivalent to [[nymph]]s or [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s in [[Europe]]an and [[Arabic]] mythology, on some ancient temples. The best and most famous example of this can be seen at the [[Khajuraho]] complex in central India built around 9th to 12th century.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nKama sutra, Vatsyayayan, commentary, sample ii, Sanskrit, Devanagari.jpg|A ''Kamasutra'' manuscript page preserved in the vaults of the Raghunatha Hindu temple in Jammu and Kashmir.\nKhajuraho12.jpg|Depictions of [[Apsara]]s from the [[Khajuraho|Khajuraho temple complex]].\nKama, mithuna artwork in Hindu temples.jpg|Kama-related arts are common in Hindu temples.

Above: 6th- to 14th-century temples in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and the Himalayas.\n</gallery>\n\n== Colonial-era ==\n[[File:Tamil Book Front Cover 1920s.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Marriage guide published in [[Madras Presidency]], in 1920s.]]\nAlthough the Portuguese and French had managed to set up some small enclaves in India, such as Goa, where the [[Catholic]] [[Inquisition]] forcibly converted some of the population of the small region to Catholicism, it was  The liberality of pre-colonial India had also respected the home and relationships.\n\n== Current issues ==\nConservative views of sexuality are now the norm in the modern republic of India, and South Asia in general. It is often argued that this is partly related to the effect of colonial influence, as well as to the puritanical elements of Islam in countries like Pakistan (e.g. the Islamic revivalist movements, which has influenced many Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh). However, such views were also prevalent in the pre-colonial era, especially since the advent of Islam in India which brought [[purdah]] as ideal for Muslim women. Before the gradual spread of Islam largely through the influence of Sufis, there seems to be evidence of liberal attitudes towards sexuality and nudity in art. However, scholars debate the degree to which Islam, as a mass and the varied phenomenon was responsible for this shift.\n\nWhile during the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s and 1970s]] in the west, many people discovered the ancient culture of sexual liberalism in India as a source for western free love movements, and [[Neotantra|neo-Tantric]] philosophy, India itself is currently the more [[Prude|prudish]] culture, embodying [[Victorian era|Victorian]] sensibilities that were abandoned decades ago in their [[country of origin]]. However, with increased exposure to world culture due to globalisation, and the proliferation of progressive ideas due to greater education and wealth, India is beginning to go through a western-style [[sexual revolution]] of its own, especially in cosmopolitan cities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Modern India===\n{{Main article|Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India}}\nModern issues that affect India, as part of the sexual revolution, have become points of argument between conservative and liberal forces, such as political parties and religious pressure groups. These issues are also matters of ethical importance in a nation where freedom and equality are guaranteed in the constitution.\n\n=== Sexuality in popular entertainment ===\n{{Main article|Sex in Indian entertainment}} [[Sex in Indian entertainment|The entertainment industry]] is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of Indian society in general. Historically, Indian television and film has lacked the frank depiction of sex; until recently, even [[kissing]] scenes were considered [[taboo]]. On the other hand, rape scenes or scenes showing sexual assault were shown. Currently, some Indian states show soft-core sexual scenes and [[nudity]] in films, whilst other areas do not. Mainstream films are still largely catered to the masses.\n\n=== Pornography ===\n{{Main article|Pornography in India}}\nThe distribution and production of pornography are both illegal in India; however, accessing pornography in private is not. Regardless, softcore films have been common since the late 1970s, and many directors have produced them. Magazine publications like ''[[Debonair (magazine)]],'' ''Fantasy,'' ''Chastity,'' ''Royal Magazine,'' and ''Dafa 302'' exist in India, and more than 50&nbsp; million Indians are believed to see porn on a daily basis.\n\nThe [[Information Technology Act]], Chapter XI Paragraph 67, the [[Government of India]] clearly considers the transmission of pornography through any electronic medium as a punishable offence. The CEO of the Indian subsidiary of [[eBay]] was charged with various criminal offences for allowing the trading of a CD on the website that contained pornography.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iltb.apargupta.com/?p=57 |title=Avnish Bajaj back in Safe Harbors |publisher=India Law and Tech Blog}}</ref>\n\n=== Sex industry ===\n{{Main article|Prostitution in India}}\nWhile [[prostitution|trade in sex]] was frowned upon in ancient India, it was tolerated and regulated so as to reduce the damage that it could do. Unfortunately, however, the stigmatisation that has arisen in modern times has left the many poor sex workers with problems of exploitation and rampant [[Sexually transmitted infection|infection]], including [[AIDS]], and worse, it has allowed a huge people-trafficking industry, like that of [[Eastern Europe]], to take hold. Many poor young women are kidnapped from villages and sold into sexual [[trafficking in human beings|slavery]].<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1205098.stm |title=Sex workers to combat trafficking, BBC News, 2001 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc2\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6925376.stm |title=HIV fears over trafficked Nepal sex workers, BBC News, 2007 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref> There have been some recent efforts to regulate the Indian sex industry.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of human sexuality]]\n* [[Hinduism and sexual orientation]]\n* [[Homosexuality in India]]\n* [[Homosexuality and Hinduism]]\n* [[Homosexuality and Sikhism]]\n* [[Kamashastra]]\n* [[Non-westernized concepts of male sexuality]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Too much further reading|date=November 2016}}\n*[[Alain Dani\u00e9lou]].

However, one common aspect remains: the existence of a subtle conspiracy of silence and taboos that clouds the Indian world of sexual desires and expressions. The silence towards India's rich contributions to sexuality is a repercussion of colonial rule and of the [[Bible]].<ref>Garc\u00eda-Arroya, Ana. First Indian Reprint: 2010, Alternative Sexualities in India.</ref> This shaped the attitude and opinions Indian people hold about their sexuality today; one that is hegemonically heterosexual and must aim at procreation after marriage. However, from the second half of the 20th century, several significant voices have challenged this silence imposed over sexuality and questioned the roles assigned to desires within the socio-political and artistic fields. Many recently published studies confirm the richness of India's erotic past and popular voices are now spotlighting this for the masses to know. A myriad of folk tales,<ref>Pattanaik, Devdutt. 2002. The Man Who Was A Woman And Other Queer Tales.</ref> sculptures like those in [[Khajuraho]],<ref>LINGIS, ALPHONSO. \"KHAJURAHO.\" Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal, vol. 62, no. 1, 1979, pp. 52\u201369. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41178110.</ref><ref>Allen, James Sloan. \"The Mystery of the Smiling Elephant: In the Erotic Temples of Khajuraho.\" The Georgia Review, vol. 53, no. 2, 1999, pp. 321\u2013340. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41401706.</ref> religious poetry<ref>Kidwai, Saleem and Vanita, Ruth. 2000.

India played a role in shaping understandings of sexuality, and it could be argued that one of the first pieces of literature that treated \"[[Kama]]\" as science came from the Indian subcontinent.<ref>V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, Richard F. Burton, and ibn M. 'Umar. The Kama Sutra. New York: Diadem Books, 1984. Print.</ref> It may be argued that historically, India pioneered the use of [[sexual education]] through various art forms like sculptures,<ref>Sahai, Surendra.1999. Khajuraho: The Art of Love, Prakash Book Depot</ref> paintings, and pieces of literature. As in all societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in \"self-gratification\" lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Moreover, there are distinct cultural differences seen through the course of history across India.\n\n== Ancient times ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = 200\n | footer = [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Hindu and Jain temple complex]] is famous for erotic arts. \n | image1 = Kamasutra 106.jpg\n | image2 = Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG\n |image3 = 2 Erotic Kama statues of Khajuraho Hindu Temple de Lakshmana Khajur\u00e2ho India 2013.jpg\n}}\nThe origins of the current Indian culture can be traced back to the [[Indus Valley civilisation]], which was contemporaneous with the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Sumer]]ian civilisations, around 2700 BCE. During this period, the first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]]. These ancient texts, the [[Rig Veda]] among few others, reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. The epics of ancient India, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], which may have been first composed as early as 500 BCE, had a huge effect on the [[culture of Asia]], influencing later [[History of China|Chinese]], [[History of Japan|Japanese]], [[Tibetan culture]] and [[History of Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It seems that [[polygamy]] was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice both [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] as a way of preserving dynastic succession.\n\n[[Nudity]] in art was considered acceptable in southern India, as shown by the paintings at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and the sculptures of the time. It is likely that as in most countries with [[tropical]] climates, Indians from some regions did not need to wear clothes, and other than for [[fashion]], there was no practical need to cover the upper half of the body. This is supported by historical evidence, which shows that men in many parts of ancient India mostly dressed only the lower half of their bodies with clothes and upper part of body was covered by gold and precious stones, jewellery, while women used to wear traditional sarees made of silk and expensive clothes as a symbol of their wealth.\n\nAs Indian civilisation further developed and the writing of the [[Upanishads]] around 500&nbsp;BCE, it was somewhere between the 1st and 6th centuries that the [[Kama Sutra]], originally known as Vatsyayana Kamasutram ('Vatsyayana's Aphorisms on Love'), was written.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} This philosophical work on kama shastra, or 'science of love', was intended as both an exploration of human desire, including infidelity, and a technical guide to pleasing a sexual partner within a marriage. This is not the only example of such a work in [[ancient India]], but is the most widely known in modern times. It is probably during this period that the text spread to ancient [[China]], along with [[Buddhist]] scriptures, where Chinese versions were written.\n\nIt is also during 10th century to 12th century that some of India's most famous ancient works of art were produced, often freely depicting romantic themes and situations. Examples of this include the depiction of [[Apsaras]], roughly equivalent to [[nymph]]s or [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s in [[Europe]]an and [[Arabic]] mythology, on some ancient temples. The best and most famous example of this can be seen at the [[Khajuraho]] complex in central India built around 9th to 12th century.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nKama sutra, Vatsyayayan, commentary, sample ii, Sanskrit, Devanagari.jpg|A ''Kamasutra'' manuscript page preserved in the vaults of the Raghunatha Hindu temple in Jammu and Kashmir.\nKhajuraho12.jpg|Depictions of [[Apsara]]s from the [[Khajuraho|Khajuraho temple complex]].\nKama, mithuna artwork in Hindu temples.jpg|Kama-related arts are common in Hindu temples.

Above: 6th- to 14th-century temples in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and the Himalayas.\n</gallery>\n\n== Colonial-era ==\n[[File:Tamil Book Front Cover 1920s.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Marriage guide published in [[Madras Presidency]], in 1920s.]]\nAlthough the Portuguese and French had managed to set up some small enclaves in India, such as Goa, where the [[Catholic]] [[Inquisition]] forcibly converted some of the population of the small region to Catholicism, it was the arrival of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], who managed to annex the entire Indian subcontinent through alliances with various monarchs, that had the largest effect on the culture of India and its attitudes to sex. The rule was indirect at first through the [[East India Company]] whose administrators did not necessarily interfere extensively and even took advantage of the tattered remnants of Hindu liberalism in sexual matters, for example through liaisons and by maintaining de facto wives. At the same time, there were significant number of [[Orientalism|orientalists]] who saw India as a great civilisation, invented the field of [[Indology]], and advocated a more accepting point of view.\n\nA number of movements were set up by prominent citizens, such as the [[Brahmo Samaj]] in [[Bengal]] and the [[Prarthana Samaj]] in [[Bombay Presidency]], to work for the 'reform' of Indian private and public life. Paradoxically while this new consciousness led to the promotion of [[education for women]] and (eventually) a raise in the [[age of consent]] and reluctant acceptance of [[remarriage]] for [[widows]], it also produced a [[Public morality|puritanical]] attitude to sex even within marriage and the home. The liberality of pre-colonial India had also respected the home and relationships.\n\n== Current issues ==\nConservative views of sexuality are now the norm in the modern republic of India, and South Asia in general. It is often argued that this is partly related to the effect of colonial influence, as well as to the puritanical elements of Islam in countries like Pakistan (e.g. the Islamic revivalist movements, which has influenced many Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh). However, such views were also prevalent in the pre-colonial era, especially since the advent of Islam in India which brought [[purdah]] as ideal for Muslim women. Before the gradual spread of Islam largely through the influence of Sufis, there seems to be evidence of liberal attitudes towards sexuality and nudity in art. However, scholars debate the degree to which Islam, as a mass and the varied phenomenon was responsible for this shift.\n\nWhile during the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s and 1970s]] in the west, many people discovered the ancient culture of sexual liberalism in India as a source for western free love movements, and [[Neotantra|neo-Tantric]] philosophy, India itself is currently the more [[Prude|prudish]] culture, embodying [[Victorian era|Victorian]] sensibilities that were abandoned decades ago in their [[country of origin]]. However, with increased exposure to world culture due to globalisation, and the proliferation of progressive ideas due to greater education and wealth, India is beginning to go through a western-style [[sexual revolution]] of its own, especially in cosmopolitan cities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Modern India===\n{{Main article|Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India}}\nModern issues that affect India, as part of the sexual revolution, have become points of argument between conservative and liberal forces, such as political parties and religious pressure groups. These issues are also matters of ethical importance in a nation where freedom and equality are guaranteed in the constitution.\n\n=== Sexuality in popular entertainment ===\n{{Main article|Sex in Indian entertainment}} [[Sex in Indian entertainment|The entertainment industry]] is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of Indian society in general. Historically, Indian television and film has lacked the frank depiction of sex; until recently, even [[kissing]] scenes were considered [[taboo]]. On the other hand, rape scenes or scenes showing sexual assault were shown. Currently, some Indian states show soft-core sexual scenes and [[nudity]] in films, whilst other areas do not. Mainstream films are still largely catered to the masses.\n\n=== Pornography ===\n{{Main article|Pornography in India}}\nThe distribution and production of pornography are both illegal in India; however, accessing pornography in private is not. Regardless, softcore films have been common since the late 1970s, and many directors have produced them. Magazine publications like ''[[Debonair (magazine)]],'' ''Fantasy,'' ''Chastity,'' ''Royal Magazine,'' and ''Dafa 302'' exist in India, and more than 50&nbsp; million Indians are believed to see porn on a daily basis.\n\nThe [[Information Technology Act]], Chapter XI Paragraph 67, the [[Government of India]] clearly considers the transmission of pornography through any electronic medium as a punishable offence. The CEO of the Indian subsidiary of [[eBay]] was charged with various criminal offences for allowing the trading of a CD on the website that contained pornography.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iltb.apargupta.com/?p=57 |title=Avnish Bajaj back in Safe Harbors |publisher=India Law and Tech Blog}}</ref>\n\n=== Sex industry ===\n{{Main article|Prostitution in India}}\nWhile [[prostitution|trade in sex]] was frowned upon in ancient India, it was tolerated and regulated so as to reduce the damage that it could do. Unfortunately, however, the stigmatisation that has arisen in modern times has left the many poor sex workers with problems of exploitation and rampant [[Sexually transmitted infection|infection]], including [[AIDS]], and worse, it has allowed a huge people-trafficking industry, like that of [[Eastern Europe]], to take hold. Many poor young women are kidnapped from villages and sold into sexual [[trafficking in human beings|slavery]].<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1205098.stm |title=Sex workers to combat trafficking, BBC News, 2001 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc2\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6925376.stm |title=HIV fears over trafficked Nepal sex workers, BBC News, 2007 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref> There have been some recent efforts to regulate the Indian sex industry.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of human sexuality]]\n* [[Hinduism and sexual orientation]]\n* [[Homosexuality in India]]\n* [[Homosexuality and Hinduism]]\n* [[Homosexuality and Sikhism]]\n* [[Kamashastra]]\n* [[Non-westernized concepts of male sexuality]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Too much further reading|date=November 2016}}\n*[[Alain Dani\u00e9lou]].

The film is directed by [[Andy Muschietti]], returning from the first film, with a screenplay by [[Gary Dauberman]]. Set in 2016, 27 years after the first film, it stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Jay Ryan (actor)|Jay Ryan]], [[James Ransone]], [[Andy Bean (actor)|Andy Bean]], and [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]], who returns as [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]. It is the second installment of the [[It (film series)|''It'' film series]]. \n\nTalks for an ''It'' sequel began in February 2016. By September 2017, [[New Line Cinema]] announced that it would be released in September 2019, with Dauberman writing the script and Muschietti to direct. [[Principal photography]] began on June 19, 2018, at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] and on locations in and around [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], [[Oshawa]] and [[Toronto, Ontario]] and wrapped on October 31, 2018. The film is produced by New Line Cinema, Double Dream, [[Vertigo Entertainment]] and Rideback, and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\n''It Chapter Two'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on August 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 6, 2019, in 2D, [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]]. The film has grossed over $473{{nbsp}}million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and themes but criticism for its near-three hour runtime and weaker scares compared to its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2016, [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]], Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by [[It (character)|Pennywise]] after a gang of homophobic youths beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner and investigating the scene, [[Mike Hanlon]] discovers It has returned, and calls his childhood friends, [[Bill Denbrough]], [[Ben Hanscom]], [[Beverly Marsh]], [[Richie Tozier]], [[Eddie Kaspbrak]], and [[Stanley Uris]], back to Derry to honor the promise they made in 1989 to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death.\n\nRichie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to It's Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail or leave town without fulfilling their promise. Meanwhile, Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the [[Derry (Stephen King)#The%20House%20on%2029%20Neibolt%20Street|Neibolt house]] and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. At a baseball game, a little girl named Victoria is killed after It, as Pennywise, deceives her by saying that he can remove a birthmark from her face. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that the Shokopiwah [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe's]] Ritual of Ch\u00fcd can stop It for good. \n\nGoing to their old clubhouse and acquiring Stan's shower cap, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from their past to be sacrificed and advises the others to find their artifacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly goes to her old home, now inhabited by an elderly woman named Mrs. Kersh, and finds Ben's love letter, still believing Bill wrote it, fleeing when Mrs. Kersh reveals herself to be It. Ben recalls another childhood encounter with Pennywise at high school before realizing his artifact is the yearbook page Beverly signed, which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artifacts: a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise confronts Richie and taunts him about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size.\n\nBill finds his childhood bicycle \"Silver\" and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed while meeting a boy named Dean, whom they saw earlier at the restaurant and lives at his old house and hears voices from the shower drain. Bill regroups with the others before running off to the carnival and into a funhouse after learning It is going after Dean, only to end up watching helplessly as Pennywise kills the boy before his eyes. Henry unsuccessfully attempts to murder Eddie before attacking Mike, though Richie intervenes and kills him. The Losers join a traumatized Bill at the Neibolt house, talking him out of facing It alone out of guilt.\n\nThe group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, Mike providing a rock from the Losers' fight with the Bowers Gang as they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after Pennywise emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Pennywise pressures Mike into revealing that It killed those who previously performed the ritual and that Mike scratched that truth off the sealing jar. Mike assures the others they have a better chance of facing their fears, but they accuse Mike of lying to them. It attacks the Losers and places Bill, Ben, and Beverly in nightmarish scenarios, which they escape once Bill lets go of his guilt over Georgie's death, and Beverly realizes Ben wrote the love letter, while Richie and Eddie are forced to choose from three doors. Mike gets caught by Pennywise, but Richie manages to distract It, allowing Mike to escape, getting caught in It's Deadlights, and Eddie is fatally impaled after saving him. Eddie reveals how he made It feel small earlier, making the Losers realize they can do that by exploiting his requirement of a physical form and how they see it. They begin taunting Pennywise, showing that they are not afraid of any of It's forms and calling the creature \"just a clown.\" Their mockeries cause Pennywise to surprisingly regress physically and mentally into a helpless infant. Mike proceeds to rip out Pennywise's heart so he and the Losers can crush it, finally killing It for good. Eddie dies from his injuries, and the Losers are forced to leave him behind when It's death causes a cave-in that destroys the Neibolt house.\n\nThe remaining Losers comfort Richie as he mourns for Eddie, their ordeal's end signified by the scars on their hands disappearing. After the Losers part ways, Ben and Beverly become a couple, Richie returns to the kissing bridge where he had once carved his and Eddie's initials, Mike decides to move out of Derry and start a new life, and Bill begins writing his new story before receiving a call from Mike as he leaves Derry, learning that Stan sent them all posthumous letters. Stan reveals in his letter that he was too scared to deal with Pennywise again, and his suicide was actually a means to give his friends a fighting chance against It and asks the remaining Losers to live life to the fullest.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Do not change; Chastain is top-billed in the film's credits  -->\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as [[Beverly Marsh]]: The only female member of the Losers Club, who was abused physically and sexually by her father and was bullied at school over false rumors of promiscuity.

Pennywise is It's favorite and primary form, although it is shown to take many in order to instill fear into its victims. It was overpowered and seriously wounded by the Losers Club in 1989, forcing it into early hibernation. This defeat motivates the monster to rebuild its strength and exact revenge against the Losers once they return to Derry.\n\nOther forms of It include Joan Gregson as Mrs. Kersh, an apparently sweet and gentle elderly woman, actually a perfidious monster who lives in Beverly's childhood home; [[Javier Botet]] as Hobo, a [[leper]] man who encountered Eddie at the 29 Neibolt Street house, and also as The Witch, the monstrous form of Mrs. Kersh; [[Jackson Robert Scott]] as [[Georgie Denbrough]], Bill's deceased younger brother; and [[Owen Teague]] as Patrick Hockstetter, Henry's dead friend who was killed by Pennywise in the sewers in 1989.

[[Xavier Dolan]] and Taylor Frey appear as Adrian Mellon<ref name=\"XavierWillCast\" /> and Don Hagarty, a gay couple who are attacked by a group of youths during a carnival before Mellon is killed by It (with Dolan also dubbing over his own voice in both French dubs), while [[Jake Weary]] appears as Webby, the leader of the youth gang who attacks Adrian and Don. Luke Roessler portrays Dean, a young boy who meets Bill near the storm drain where Georgie was killed in 1988, and is later killed by It at the Funland, while Ryan Kiera Armstrong appears as Victoria Fuller, a little girl with a large birthmark on her cheek, who is killed by It after he lures her to under the bleachers at a baseball game.

Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me, but there's only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies. There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie. It's just a question of whether or not people want to see it.

The film is directed by [[Andy Muschietti]], returning from the first film, with a screenplay by [[Gary Dauberman]]. Set in 2016, 27 years after the first film, it stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Jay Ryan (actor)|Jay Ryan]], [[James Ransone]], [[Andy Bean (actor)|Andy Bean]], and [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]], who returns as [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]. It is the second installment of the [[It (film series)|''It'' film series]]. \n\nTalks for an ''It'' sequel began in February 2016. By September 2017, [[New Line Cinema]] announced that it would be released in September 2019, with Dauberman writing the script and Muschietti to direct. [[Principal photography]] began on June 19, 2018, at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] and on locations in and around [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], [[Oshawa]] and [[Toronto, Ontario]] and wrapped on October 31, 2018. The film is produced by New Line Cinema, Double Dream, [[Vertigo Entertainment]] and Rideback, and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\n''It Chapter Two'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on August 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 6, 2019, in 2D, [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]]. The film has grossed over $473{{nbsp}}million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and themes but criticism for its near-three hour runtime and weaker scares compared to its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2016, [[Derry (Stephen King)|Derry, Maine]], Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by [[It (character)|Pennywise]] after a gang of homophobic youths beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner and investigating the scene, [[Mike Hanlon]] discovers It has returned, and calls his childhood friends, [[Bill Denbrough]], [[Ben Hanscom]], [[Beverly Marsh]], [[Richie Tozier]], [[Eddie Kaspbrak]], and [[Stanley Uris]], back to Derry to honor the promise they made in 1989 to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death.\n\nRichie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to It's Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail or leave town without fulfilling their promise. Meanwhile, Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the [[Derry (Stephen King)#The%20House%20on%2029%20Neibolt%20Street|Neibolt house]] and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. At a baseball game, a little girl named Victoria is killed after It, as Pennywise, deceives her by saying that he can remove a birthmark from her face. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that the Shokopiwah [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe's]] Ritual of Ch\u00fcd can stop It for good. \n\nGoing to their old clubhouse and acquiring Stan's shower cap, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from their past to be sacrificed and advises the others to find their artifacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly goes to her old home, now inhabited by an elderly woman named Mrs. Kersh, and finds Ben's love letter, still believing Bill wrote it, fleeing when Mrs. Kersh reveals herself to be It. Ben recalls another childhood encounter with Pennywise at high school before realizing his artifact is the yearbook page Beverly signed, which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artifacts: a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise confronts Richie and taunts him about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size.\n\nBill finds his childhood bicycle \"Silver\" and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed while meeting a boy named Dean, whom they saw earlier at the restaurant and lives at his old house and hears voices from the shower drain. Bill regroups with the others before running off to the carnival and into a funhouse after learning It is going after Dean, only to end up watching helplessly as Pennywise kills the boy before his eyes. Henry unsuccessfully attempts to murder Eddie before attacking Mike, though Richie intervenes and kills him. The Losers join a traumatized Bill at the Neibolt house, talking him out of facing It alone out of guilt.\n\nThe group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, Mike providing a rock from the Losers' fight with the Bowers Gang as they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after Pennywise emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Pennywise pressures Mike into revealing that It killed those who previously performed the ritual and that Mike scratched that truth off the sealing jar. Mike assures the others they have a better chance of facing their fears, but they accuse Mike of lying to them. It attacks the Losers and places Bill, Ben, and Beverly in nightmarish scenarios, which they escape once Bill lets go of his guilt over Georgie's death, and Beverly realizes Ben wrote the love letter, while Richie and Eddie are forced to choose from three doors. Mike gets caught by Pennywise, but Richie manages to distract It, allowing Mike to escape, getting caught in It's Deadlights, and Eddie is fatally impaled after saving him. Eddie reveals how he made It feel small earlier, making the Losers realize they can do that by exploiting his requirement of a physical form and how they see it. They begin taunting Pennywise, showing that they are not afraid of any of It's forms and calling the creature \"just a clown.\" Their mockeries cause Pennywise to surprisingly regress physically and mentally into a helpless infant. Mike proceeds to rip out Pennywise's heart so he and the Losers can crush it, finally killing It for good. Eddie dies from his injuries, and the Losers are forced to leave him behind when It's death causes a cave-in that destroys the Neibolt house.\n\nThe remaining Losers comfort Richie as he mourns for Eddie, their ordeal's end signified by the scars on their hands disappearing. After the Losers part ways, Ben and Beverly become a couple, Richie returns to the kissing bridge where he had once carved his and Eddie's initials, Mike decides to move out of Derry and start a new life, and Bill begins writing his new story before receiving a call from Mike as he leaves Derry, learning that Stan sent them all posthumous letters. Stan reveals in his letter that he was too scared to deal with Pennywise again, and his suicide was actually a means to give his friends a fighting chance against It and asks the remaining Losers to live life to the fullest.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Do not change; Chastain is top-billed in the film's credits  -->\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as [[Beverly Marsh]]: The only female member of the Losers Club, who was abused physically and sexually by her father and was bullied at school over false rumors of promiscuity.

The book ends where the second movie ends, so that is the final chapter of this story. There is this interesting aspect of going back in time before all this happened. There might be a story there that might be worth exploring. Obviously that would be a story that's not in the book, it would be a freestanding story, but obviously within the same universe. So, there might be something interesting out of it. I think it would be fun.\"<ref>https://ew.com/movies/2019/09/08/it-chapter-two-pennywise-bill-skarsgard/</ref>\n\nIn November 2019, Dauberman discussed in an interview of the possibility of a third film, saying, \"I do think it's possible. Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me, but there's only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies. There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie. It's just a question of whether or not people want to see it. I do think It was on this planet for a very, very, very long time and that's a lot of bloodshed and a lot of stories to tell and I think you could do that for sure.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/it-chapter-3-1839759979/amp|title=It Chapter 3: Screenwriter Gary Dauberman Says 'It's Possible'|website=io9.gizmodo.com|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n\n* {{official website}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllRovi title}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Stephen King's It}}\n{{Media based on Stephen King works|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Andy Muschietti}}\n{{Portal bar|Film|United States|Speculative fiction/Horror}}\n\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:2019 films]]\n[[Category:2019 horror films]]\n[[Category:2010s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s monster movies]]\n[[Category:2010s psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:2010s sequel films]]\n[[Category:2010s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:American psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:Demons in film]]\n[[Category:Dark fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Films about domestic violence]]\n[[Category:Films about psychopaths]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films about comedians]]\n[[Category:Films about fashion designers]]\n[[Category:Films about child death]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Films about fear]]\n[[Category:Films based on American horror novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Stephen King]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andy Muschietti]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Dan Lin]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Benjamin Wallfisch]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1989]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 2010s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2016]]\n[[Category:Films set in fictional populated places]]\n[[Category:Films set in Maine]]\n[[Category:Films set in psychiatric hospitals]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Gary Dauberman]]\n[[Category:Homophobia in fiction]]\n[[Category:Suicide in film]]\n[[Category:Horror films about clowns]]\n[[Category:Native Americans in popular culture]]\n[[Category:It (novel)]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related horror films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n", "name_user": "69.158.96.10", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCast)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Chapter_Two"}
