Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of [[Amorite]]<ref>{{ cite book | title = The Kingdom of the Hittites | author = Trevor Bryce | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 98 }}</ref> [[First Babylonian dynasty|Babylon]] and a series of ineffectual [[Assyria]]n kings created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia.\n\nAt the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thutmosids]]. However, with the ascent of the [[Hittite Empire]], Mitanni and Egypt struck an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, Mitanni had outposts centred on its capital, [[Washukanni]], whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the [[headwaters]] of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]]. The Mitanni dynasty ruled over the northern [[Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system|Euphrates-Tigris]] region between c. 1475 and c. 1275 BC. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks and was reduced to the status of a province of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]].\n\nWhile the Mitanni kings were [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], they used the language of the local people, which was at that time a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language, Hurrian. Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the [[Levant]] of a distinct pottery type.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Mitanni controlled [[trade route]]s down the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] to [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and up the [[Euphrates]] from there to [[Carchemish]]. For a time they also controlled the [[Assyria]]n territories of the upper [[Tigris]] and its headwaters at [[Nineveh]], [[Erbil]], [[Assur]] and [[Nuzi]]. Their allies included [[Kizuwatna]] in southeastern [[Anatolia]]; Mukish, which stretched between [[Ugarit]] and [[Quatna]] west of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] to the sea; and the [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]], which controlled the east bank of the Orontes from [[Alalah]] down through [[Aleppo]], [[Ebla]] and [[Hama]] to Qatna and [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. To the east, they had good relations with the [[Kassites]].<ref>Michael Roaf, ''Cambridge Atlas of Mesopotamia'', maps, pp. 134&ndash;135.</ref> The land of Mitanni in northern Syria extended from the [[Taurus mountains]] to its west and as far east as Nuzi (modern [[Kirkuk]]) and the river Tigris in the east. In the south, it extended from Aleppo across (''Nuhasse'') to Mari on the Euphrates in the east. Its centre was in the Khabur River valley, with two capitals:  [[Taite]] and [[Washukanni]], called ''Taidu'' and ''Ussukana'' respectively in Assyrian sources. The whole area supported agriculture without artificial irrigation and cattle, sheep and goats were raised. It is very similar to Assyria in climate, and was settled by both indigenous Hurrian and [[Amorites|Amoritic]]-speaking (''Amurru'') populations.\n\n==Name==\nThe Mitanni kingdom was referred to as the '''Maryannu, Nahrin''' or '''Mitanni''' by the [[Egyptians]], the '''Hurri''' by the Hittites, and the '''Hanigalbat''' by the Assyrians. The different names seem to have referred to the same kingdom and were used interchangeably, according to Michael C. Astour.<ref>Astour, \"\u1e2aattusilis\u0306, \u1e2aalab, and \u1e2aanigalbat\" ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' '''31'''.2 (April 1972:102&ndash;109) p 103.</ref> Hittite annals mention a people called ''Hurri'' (''{{transl|hit|\u1e2au-ur-ri}}''), located in northeastern Syria. A Hittite fragment, probably from the time of [[Mursili I]], mentions a \"King of the Hurri\". The [[Akkadian language|Assyro-Akkadian]] version of the text renders \"Hurri\" as ''Hanigalbat''. Tushratta, who styles himself \"king of Mitanni\" in his [[Amarna letters|Akkadian Amarna letters]], refers to his kingdom as Hanigalbat.<ref>Astour 1972:103, noting Amarna letters 18:9; 20:17;29:49.</ref>\n\nEgyptian sources call Mitanni \"''nhrn''{{-\"}}, which is usually pronounced as ''[[Naharin]](a)'',<ref>Faulkner, Raymond O. ''A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian.'' p.135. Griffith Institute, Oxford, 1962; [http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/Kitchen%20-%20New%20Kingdom%20Topographical%20Lists.pdf Egyptian New Kingdom Topographical lists], by Kenneth Kitchen, p.5 bottom paragraph, University of Memphis</ref> from the [[Akkadian language|Assyro-Akkadian]] word for \"river\", cf. ''[[Aram-Naharaim]]''. The name ''Mitanni'' is first found in the \"memoirs\" of the Syrian wars (c. 1480 BC) of the official astronomer and clockmaker Amenemhet, who returned from the \"foreign country called ''Me-ta-ni''\" at the time of [[Thutmose I]].<ref>His memoir was published by L. Borchardt, \"Alt\u00e4gyptische Zeitmessung\" in E. von Basserman-Jordan, ''Die Geschichte der Zeitmessung und der \u00dchre'', vol. I. (Berlin/Leipzig) 1930, pp 60ff, noted in Astour 1972:104, notes 25,26.</ref> The expedition to the Naharina announced by [[Thutmosis I]] at the beginning of his reign<ref>W. Helck, ''''Oriens Antiquus'' '''8''' 1969:301, note 41; 302.</ref> may have actually taken place during the long previous reign of [[Amenhotep I]].<ref>[[\u00c9. Drioton]] and J. Vandier, ''L'\u00c9gypte'', 4th ed. (Paris) 1962: 396f.</ref> Helck believes that this was the expedition mentioned by [[Amenhotep II]].\n\nThe reading of the Assyrian term ''\u1e2aanigalbat'' has a history of multiple renderings. The first portion has been connected to, \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udd29\ud808\ude61}} ''{{transl|akk|\u1e2aa-nu}}''\", \"Hanu\" or \"Hana\", first attested in [[Mari]] to describe nomadic inhabitants along the southern shore of the northern [[Euphrates]] region, near the vicinity of [[Terqa]] and the [[Khabur_(Euphrates)|Khabur]] River. The term developed into more than just a designation for a people group, but also took on a topographic aspect as well. In the Middle Assyrian period, a phrase \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udf37\ud808\uddb3\ud808\udd29\ud808\ude61\ud808\udc2d\ud808\udeeb}}\" ''{{transl|akk|<sup>URU</sup>KUR \u1e2aa-nu AN.TA}}''\", \"cities of the Upper Hanu\" has suggested that there was a distinction between two different Hanu's, likely across each side of the river. This northern side designation spans much of the core territory of Mitanni state. \n\nThe two signs that have lead to variant readings are \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udcf2}} ''{{transl|akk|gal}}''\" and its alternative form \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udd97}} ''{{transl|akk|gal<sub>9</sub>}}''\". The first attempts at decipherment in the late 1800s, rendered forms interpreting \"''gal''\", meaning \"great\" in Sumerian, as a logogram for Akkadian \"''rab''\" having the same meaning; \"\u1e2aani-Rabbat\" denoting \"''the Great Hani''\". [[J\u00f8rgen Alexander Knudtzon|J.A. Knudtzon]] and [[E.A. Speiser]] after him, supported instead the reading of \"''gal''\" on the basis of its alternative spelling with \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\", which has since become the majority view. \n\nThere is still a difficulty to explain the suffix \"''-bat''\" if the first sign did not end in \"''b''\", or the apparent similarity to the Semitic feminine ending \"''-at''\", if derived from a Hurrian word. More recently scholar [[Miguel Val\u00e9rio]] of the [[New University of Lisbon]], provided detailed support in favor of the older reading. The re-reading makes argument on basis of frequency, where \"''gal''\" not \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\", is far more numerous; the later being the deviation found in six documents, all from the periphery of the Akkadian sphere of influence. Additionally argued, although graphically distinct, there is a high degree of overlap between the two signs, as \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\" denotes \"''dannum''\" or \"\"strong\"\" opposed to \"great\", easily being used as synonyms. Both signs also represent correlative readings; alternative readings of \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\" include \"''rib''\" and \"''rip''\", just like \"''gal''\" being read as \"''rab''\".\n\n== People ==\n[[File:Cylinder seal,ca. 16th\u201315th century BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal, c. 16th\u201315th century BC, Mitanni]]\nThe ethnicity of the people of Mitanni is difficult to ascertain.

There is no indication that these persons owed allegiance to the political entity of Mitanni; although the [[German language|German]] term ''Auslandshurriter'' (\"Hurrian expatriates\") has been used by some authors. In the 14th century BC numerous city-states in northern Syria and Canaan were ruled by persons with Hurrian and some Indo-Aryan names. If this can be taken to mean that the population of these states was Hurrian as well, then it is possible that these entities were a part of a larger polity with a shared Hurrian identity. This is often assumed, but without a critical examination of the sources. Differences in dialect and regionally different pantheons (''Hepat/Shawushka, Sharruma/Tilla'' etc.) point to the existence of several groups of Hurrian speakers.\n\n==History==\n\nNo native sources for the history of Mitanni have been found so far. The account is mainly based on Assyrian, Hittite, and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] sources, as well as inscriptions from nearby places in Syria. Often it is not even possible to establish synchronicity between the rulers of different countries and cities, let alone give uncontested absolute dates. The definition and history of Mitanni is further beset by a lack of differentiation between linguistic, ethnic and political groups.\n\n===Summary===\n[[File:Cylinder seal and modern impression Nude male, griffins, monkey, lion, goat, ca 15th 14th century BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal and modern impression: nude male, griffins, monkey, lion, goat, c. 15th/14th century BC, Mitanni]]\nIt is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of [[Babylon]] due to its sacking by Hittite king [[Mursili I]], and the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo ([[Yamhad]]), the weak middle Assyrian kings who succeeded [[Puzur-Ashur III]], and the internal strife of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper [[Mesopotamia]]. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni.\n\nKing [[Barattarna]] of Mitanni expanded the kingdom west to Aleppo and made the [[Canaan]]ite{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} king [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]] his vassal. The state of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the west also shifted its allegiance to Mitanni, and Assyria in the east had become largely a Mitannian vassal state by the mid-15th century BC. The nation grew stronger during the reign of [[Shaushtatar]], but the Hurrians were keen to keep the Hittites inside the Anatolian highland. Kizzuwatna in the west and [[Ishuwa]] in the north were important allies against the hostile Hittites.\n\nAfter a few successful clashes with the Egyptians  over the control of Syria, Mitanni sought peace with them, and an alliance was formed. During the reign of [[Shuttarna II|Shuttarna]], in the early 14th century BC, the relationship was very amicable, and he sent his daughter Gilu-Hepa to Egypt for a marriage with Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]. Mitanni was now at its peak of power.\n \nHowever, by the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390\u20131366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna II]], who called himself king of the [[Hurri]] while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.<ref>George Roux, '' Ancient Iraq''</ref>\nKing [[Ashur-Uballit I]] (1365\u20131330 BC) of [[Assyria]] attacked Shuttarna and annexed Mitanni territory in the middle of the 14th century BC, making Assyria once more a great power.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |date=2014 |title=[[1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed]] |url= |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=61 |isbn=1400849985 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nAt the death of Shuttarna, Mitanni was ravaged by a war of succession. Eventually Tushratta, a son of Shuttarna, ascended the throne, but the kingdom had been weakened considerably and both the Hittite and Assyrian threats increased. At the same time, the diplomatic relationship with Egypt went cold, the Egyptians fearing the growing power of the Hittites and Assyrians. The Hittite king [[Suppiluliuma I]] invaded the Mitanni vassal states in northern Syria and replaced them with loyal subjects.\n\nIn the capital [[Washukanni]], a new power struggle broke out. The Hittites and the Assyrians supported different pretenders to the throne. Finally a Hittite army conquered the capital Washukanni and installed [[Shattiwaza]], the son of Tushratta, as their vassal king of Mitanni in the late 14th century BC. The kingdom had by now been reduced to the Khabur Valley. The Assyrians had not given up their claim on Mitanni, and in the 13th century BC, [[Shalmaneser I]] annexed the kingdom.\n\n===Early kingdom===\n\nAs early as [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] times, Hurrians are known to have lived east of the river Tigris on the northern rim of Mesopotamia, and in the Khabur Valley. The group which became Mitanni gradually moved south into Mesopotamia before the 17th century BC.\n\nHurrians are mentioned in the private [[Nuzi]] texts, in [[Ugarit]], and the Hittite archives in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y]]). [[Cuneiform (script)|Cuneiform]] texts from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] mention rulers of city-states in upper Mesopotamia with both ''Amurru'' (Amorite) and Hurrian names. Rulers with Hurrian names are also attested for [[Urshu]]m and [[Hassum]], and tablets from [[Alalakh]] (layer VII, from the later part of the Old [[Babylonia]]n period) mention people with Hurrian names at the mouth of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]]. There is no evidence for any invasion from the North-east. Generally, these [[onomastic]] sources have been taken as evidence for a Hurrian expansion to the South and the West.\n\nA Hittite fragment, probably from the time of [[Mursili I]], mentions a \"King of the Hurrians\" (''LUGAL ER\u00cdN.ME\u0160 Hurri''). This terminology was last used for King Tushratta of Mitanni, in a letter in the Amarna archives. The normal title of the king was 'King of the Hurri-men' (without the determinative ''KUR'' indicating a country).\n\nIt is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of [[Babylon]] due to the Hittite sack by [[Mursili I]] and the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo ([[Yamkhad]]), the weak middle Assyrian kings, and the internal strifes of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper Mesopotamia. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni. The legendary founder of the Mitannian dynasty was a king called [[Kirta]], who was followed by a king [[Shuttarna I|Shuttarna]]. Nothing is known about these early kings.\n\n===Barattarna / Parsha(ta)tar ===\n{{Main|Parshatatar}}\n\nKing Barattarna is known from a cuneiform tablet in Nuzi and an inscription by [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050414015739/http://www.geocities.com/farfarer2001/alalakh/idrimi_inscription.htm ''IDRIMI INSCRIPTION'']</ref>  Egyptian sources do not mention his name; that he was the king of Naharin whom [[Thutmose III]] fought against in the 15th century BC can only be deduced from assumptions. Whether Parsha(ta)tar, known from another Nuzi inscription, is the same as Barattarna, or a different king, is debated.\n\nUnder the rule of Thutmose III, Egyptian troops crossed the Euphrates and entered the core lands of Mitanni. At [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], he fought an alliance of 330 Mitanni princes and tribal leaders under the ruler of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. See [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)]]. Mitanni had sent troops as well. Whether this was done because of existing treaties, or only in reaction to a common threat, remains open to debate. The Egyptian victory opened the way north.\n\nThutmose III again waged war in Mitanni in the 33rd year of his rule. The Egyptian army crossed the Euphrates at [[Carchemish]] and reached a town called Iryn (maybe present day Erin, 20&nbsp;km northwest of Aleppo.) They sailed down the Euphrates to [[Emar]] (Meskene) and then returned home via Mitanni. A hunt for elephants at Lake Nija was important enough to be included in the annals. This was impressive propaganda, but did not lead to any permanent rule.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Only the area at the [[Orontes River|middle Orontes]] and [[Phoenicia]] became part of Egyptian territory.\n\nVictories over Mitanni are recorded from the Egyptian campaigns in ''Nuhasse'' (middle part of Syria). Again, this did not lead to permanent territorial gains. Barattarna or his son Shaushtatar controlled the North Mitanni interior up to ''Nuhasse'', and the coastal territories from [[Kizzuwatna]] to Alalakh in the kingdom of Mukish at the mouth of the Orontes. Idrimi of Alalakh, returning from Egyptian exile, could only ascend his throne with Barattarna's consent. While he got to rule Mukish and Ama'u, [[Aleppo]] remained with Mitanni.\n\n===Shaushtatar===\n{{Main|Shaushtatar}}\n[[File:Royal seal of \u0160au\u0161tatar of Mitanni.svg|thumb|right|Shaushtatar's royal seal.]]\n\n[[Shaushtatar]], king of Mitanni, sacked the Assyrian capital of [[Assur]] some time in the 15th century during the reign of [[Nur-ili]], and took the silver and golden doors of the royal palace to [[Washukanni]].<ref>Cline 2014, p. 61</ref> This is known from a later Hittite document, the Suppililiuma-Shattiwaza treaty. After the sack of Assur, Assyria may have paid tribute to Mitanni up to the time of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390&ndash;1366 BC). There is no trace of that in the Assyrian king lists; therefore it is probable that Ashur was ruled by a native Assyrian dynasty owing sporadic allegiance to the house of Shaushtatar. While a sometime vassal of Mitanni, the temple of [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] and [[Shamash]] was built in Ashur.\n\nThe states of [[Aleppo]] in the west, and [[Nuzi]] and [[Arrapha]] in the east, seem to have been incorporated into Mitanni under Shaushtatar as well. The palace of the [[Crown Prince|crown prince]], the governor of Arrapha has been excavated. A letter from Shaushtatar was discovered in the house of Shilwe-Teshup. His [[Seal (device)|seal]] shows heroes and winged geniuses fighting lions and other animals, as well as a [[winged sun]]. This style, with a multitude of figures distributed over the whole of the available space, is taken as typically Hurrian. A second seal, belonging to Shuttarna I, but used by Shaushtatar, found in Alalakh, shows a more traditional Assyro-Akkadian style.\n\nThe military superiority of Mitanni was probably based on the use of two-wheeled war-[[chariots]], driven by the 'Marjannu' people. A text on the training of war-horses, written by a certain \"[[Kikkuli]] the Mitannian\" has been found in the archives recovered at [[Hattusa]]. More speculative is the attribution of the introduction of the chariot in Mesopotamia to early Mitanni.\n\nDuring the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II]], Mitanni seems to have regained influence in the middle Orontes valley that had been conquered by Thutmose III. Amenhotep fought in Syria in 1425 BC, presumably against Mitanni as well, but did not reach the Euphrates.\n\n===Artatama I and Shuttarna II===\n{{Main|Artatama I|Shuttarna II}}\n\nLater on, Egypt and Mitanni became allies, and King [[Shuttarna II]] himself was received at the Egyptian court. Amicable letters, sumptuous gifts, and letters asking for sumptuous gifts were exchanged. Mitanni was especially interested in Egyptian gold. This culminated in a number of royal marriages: the daughter of King [[Artatama I]] was married to [[Thutmose IV of Egypt|Thutmose IV]]. Kilu-Hepa, or [[Gilukhipa]], the daughter of Shuttarna II, was married to Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]], who ruled in the early 14th century BC. In a later royal marriage Tadu-Hepa, or [[Tadukhipa]], the daughter of Tushratta, was sent to Egypt.\n\nWhen [[Amenhotep III]] fell ill, the king of Mitanni sent him a statue of the goddess Shaushka ([[Ishtar]]) of [[Nineveh]] that was reputed to cure diseases. A more or less permanent border between Egypt and Mitanni seems to have existed near [[Qatna]] on the Orontes River; [[Ugarit]] was part of Egyptian territory.\n\nThe reason Mitanni sought peace with Egypt may have been trouble with the Hittites. A Hittite king called [[Tudhaliya]] conducted campaigns against Kizzuwatna, [[Arzawa]], [[Ishuwa]], Aleppo, and maybe against Mitanni itself. Kizzuwatna may have fallen to the Hittites at that time.\n\n===Artashumara and Tushratta===\n{{Main|Artashumara|Tushratta}}\n[[Image:Cuneiform letter to Amenhotep III.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Cuneiform tablet containing a letter from Tushratta of Mitanni to Amenhotep III (of 13 letters of King Tushratta).]]\n\nArtashumara followed his father Shuttarna II on the throne, but was murdered by a certain UD-hi, or Uthi. It is uncertain what intrigues that followed, but UD-hi then placed [[Tushratta]], another son of Shuttarna, on the throne. Probably, he was quite young at the time and was intended to serve as a figurehead only. However, he managed to dispose of the murderer, possibly with the help of his Egyptian father-in-law, but this is sheer speculation.\n\nThe Egyptians may have suspected the mighty days of Mitanni were about to end. In order to protect their Syrian border zone the new Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] instead received envoys from the resurgent powers of the Hittites and Assyria. From the [[Amarna letters]] it is known that Tushratta's desperate claim for a gold statue from Akhenaten developed into a major diplomatic crisis.\n\nThe unrest weakened the Mitannian control of their vassal states, and [[Aziru]] of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] seized the opportunity and made a secret deal with the Hittite king [[Suppiluliuma I]]. [[Kizzuwatna]], which had seceded from the Hittites, was reconquered by Suppiluliuma. In what has been called his first Syrian campaign, Suppiluliuma then invaded the western Euphrates valley, and conquered the ''Amurru'' and ''Nuhasse'' in Mitanni.\n\nAccording to the later Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, Suppiluliuma had made a treaty with [[Artatama II]], a rival of Tushratta. Nothing is known of this Artatama's previous life or connection, if any, to the royal family. He is called \"king of the Hurri\", while Tushratta went by the title \"King of Mitanni\". This must have disagreed with Tushratta. Suppiluliuma began to plunder the lands on the west bank of the Euphrates, and annexed [[Mount Lebanon]]. Tushratta threatened to raid beyond the Euphrates if even a single lamb or kid was stolen.\nBy the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390&ndash;1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between Tushratta and his brother Artatama II and after this his son Shuttarna III, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs\n\nSuppiluliuma then recounts how the land of [[Ishuwa]] on the upper Euphrates had seceded in the time of his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it had failed. In the time of his father, other cities had rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have defeated them, but the survivors had fled to the territory of Ishuwa, that must have been part of Mitanni. A clause to return fugitives is part of many treaties between sovereign states and between rulers and vassal states, so perhaps the harbouring of fugitives by Ishuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion.\n\nA Hittite army crossed the border, entered Ishuwa and returned the fugitives (or deserters or exile governments) to Hittite rule. \"I freed the lands that I captured; they dwelt in their places. All the people whom I released rejoined their peoples, and Hatti incorporated their territories.\"\n\nThe Hittite army then marched through various districts towards [[Washukanni]]. Suppiluliuma claims to have plundered the area, and to have brought loot, captives, cattle, sheep and horses back to Hatti. He also claims that Tushratta fled, though obviously he failed to capture the capital. While the campaign weakened Mitanni, it did not endanger its existence.\n\nIn a second campaign, the Hittites again crossed the Euphrates and subdued [[Aleppo]], [[Mukish]], [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]], [[Arahati]], [[Apina]], and Qatna, as well as some cities whose names have not been preserved. The booty from Arahati included charioteers, who were brought to Hatti together with all their possessions. While it was common practice to incorporate enemy soldiers in the army, this might point to a Hittite attempt to counter the most potent weapon of Mitanni, the war-chariots, by building up or strengthening their own chariot forces.\n\nAll in all, Suppiluliuma claims to have conquered the lands \"from Mount Lebanon and from the far bank of the Euphrates\". But Hittite governors or vassal rulers are mentioned only for some cities and kingdoms. While the Hittites made some territorial gains in western Syria, it seems unlikely that they established a permanent rule east of the Euphrates.\n\n===Shattiwaza / Kurtiwaza===\n{{Main|Shattiwaza}}\n[[File:Cylinder seal, ca. 1500\u20131350 BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal, c. 1500\u20131350 BC, Mitanni]]\nA son of Tushratta conspired with his subjects, and killed his father in order to become king. His brother [[Shattiwaza]] was forced to flee. In the unrest that followed, the Assyrians asserted themselves under [[Ashur-uballit I]], and he invaded the country; the pretender Artatama/Atratama II gained ascendancy, followed by his son Shuttarna. Suppiluliuma claims that \"the entire land of Mittanni went to ruin, and the land of Assyria and the land of [[Alshi]] divided it between them\", but this sounds more like wishful thinking. Although Assyria annexed Mitanni territory, the kingdom survived. Shuttarna wisely maintained good relations with Assyria, and returned to it the palace doors of Ashur, that had been taken by Shaushtatar. Such booty formed a powerful political symbol in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nThe fugitive Shattiwaza may have gone to [[Babylon]] first, but eventually ended up at the court of the Hittite king, who married him to one of his daughters. The treaty between Suppiluliuma of Hatti and Shattiwaza of Mitanni has been preserved and is one of the main sources on this period. After the conclusion of the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, [[Piyassili]], a son of Suppiluliuma, led a Hittite army into Mitanni. According to Hittite sources, Piyassili and Shattiwaza crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish, then marched against [[Irridu]] in Hurrian territory. They sent messengers from the west bank of the Euphrates and seemed to have expected a friendly welcome, but the people were loyal to their new ruler, influenced, as Suppiluliuma claims, by the riches of Tushratta. \"Why are you coming? If you are coming for battle, come, but you shall not return to the land of the Great King!\" they taunted. Shuttarna had sent men to strengthen the troops and chariots of the district of Irridu, but the Hittite army won the battle, and the people of Irridu sued for peace.\n\nMeanwhile, an Assyrian army \"led by a single charioteer\" marched on the capital Washukanni. It seems that Shuttarna had sought Assyrian aid in the face of the Hittite threat. Possibly the force sent did not meet his expectations, or he changed his mind. In any case, the Assyrian army was refused entrance, and set instead to besiege the capital. This seems to have turned the mood against Shuttarna; perhaps the majority of the inhabitants of Washukanni decided they were better off with the Hittite Empire than with their former subjects. In any case, a messenger was sent to Piyassili and Shattiwaza at Irridu, who delivered his message in public, at the city gate. Piyassili and Shattiwaza marched on Washukanni, and the cities of Harran and Pakarripa seem to have surrendered to them.\n\nWhile at Pakarripa, a desolate country where the troops suffered hunger, they received word of an Assyrian advance, but the enemy never materialised. The allies pursued the retreating Assyrian troops to Nilap-ini but could not force a confrontation. The Assyrians seem to have retreated home in the face of the superior force of the Hittites.\n\nShattiwaza became king of Mitanni, but after Suppililiuma had taken Carchemish and the land west of the Euphrates, that were governed by his son Piyassili, Mitanni was restricted to the Khabur River and [[Balikh River]] valleys, and became more and more dependent on their allies in [[Hattarsus]]. Some scholars speak of a Hittite puppet kingdom, a buffer-state against the powerful Assyria.\n\nAssyria under [[Ashur-uballit I]] began to infringe on Mitanni as well. Its vassal state of [[Nuzi]] east of the Tigris was conquered and destroyed. According to the Hittitologist [[Trevor R. Bryce]], Mitanni (or Hanigalbat as it was known) was permanently lost to Assyria during the reign of [[Mursili III]] of the Hittites, who was defeated by the Assyrians in the process. Its loss was a major blow to Hittite prestige in the ancient world and undermined the young king's authority over his kingdom.\n\n===Shattuara I===\n{{Main|Shattuara}}\n\nThe royal inscriptions of the Assyrian king [[Adad-nirari I]] (c. 1307&ndash;1275 BC) relate how the vassal king [[Shattuara]] of Mitanni rebelled and committed hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara was related to the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars think that he was the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza's one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. This must have happened during the reign of the Hittite King [[Mursili II]], but there is no exact date.\n\n===Wasashatta===\n{{Main|Wasashatta}}\nDespite Assyrian strength, Shattuara's son [[Wasashatta]] attempted to rebel. He sought Hittite help, but that kingdom was preoccupied with internal struggles, possibly connected with the usurpation of [[Hattusili III]], who had driven his nephew [[Mursili III|Urhi-Teshup]] into exile. The Hittites took Wasashatta's money but did not help, as Adad-nirari's inscriptions gleefully note.\n\nThe Assyrians expanded further, and conquered the royal city of [[Taite|Taidu]], and took [[Washukanni]], [[Amasakku]], [[Tell Barri|Kahat]], [[Shuru, Fars|Shuru]], [[Nabula]], [[Hurra, Syria|Hurra]] and [[Shuduhu]] as well. They conquered [[Irridu]], destroyed it utterly and [[salting the earth|sowed salt over it]].\nThe wife, sons and daughters of Wasashatta were taken to [[Ashur]], together with much booty and other prisoners. As Wasashatta himself is not mentioned, he must have escaped capture. There are letters of Wasashatta in the Hittite archives. Some scholars think he became ruler of a reduced Mitanni state called [[Shubria]].\n\nWhile [[Adad-nirari I]] conquered the Mitanni heartland between the [[Balikh]] and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] from the [[Hittites]], he does not seem to have crossed the Euphrates, and [[Carchemish]] remained part of the Hittite kingdom. With his victory over Mitanni, Adad-nirari claimed the title of Great King (''sharru rab\u00fb'') in letters to the Hittite rulers.\n\n===Shattuara II===\n{{Main|Shattuara II}}\n\nIn the reign of [[Shalmaneser I]] (1270s&ndash;1240s) King [[Shattuara]] of Mitanni, a son or nephew of Wasahatta, rebelled against the Assyrian yoke with the help of the Hittites and the nomadic [[Ahlamu]] ([[Arameans]]) around 1250 BC.<ref>Bryce 2005, p. 314</ref> His army was well prepared; they had occupied all the mountain passes and waterholes, so that the Assyrian army suffered from thirst during their advance.\n\nNevertheless, Shalmaneser I won a crushing victory for Assyria over the Hittites and Mitanni. He claims to have slain 14,400 men; the rest were blinded and carried away. His inscriptions mention the conquest of nine fortified temples; 180 Hurrian cities were \"turned into rubble mounds\", and Shalmaneser \"\u2026slaughtered like sheep the armies of the Hittites and the Ahlamu his allies\u2026\". The cities from Taidu to [[Irridu]] were captured, as well as all of mount Kashiar to Eluhat and the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates. Another inscription mentions the construction of a temple to the Assyrian god [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]] in Kahat, a city of Mitanni that must have been occupied as well.\n\n===Hanigalbat as an Assyrian province===\nA part of the population was deported and served as cheap labour. Administrative documents mention barley allotted to \"uprooted men\", deportees from Mitanni. For example, the Assyrian governor of the city [[Nahur (Mesopotamia)|Nahur]], [[Meli-Sah]], received barley to be distributed to deported persons from [[Shuduhu]] \"as seed, food for their oxen and for themselves\".\nThe Assyrians built a line of frontier fortifications against the Hittites on the [[Balikh River]].\n\nMitanni was now ruled by the Assyrian grand-vizier [[Il\u012b-pad\u00e2]], a member of the royal family, who took the title of king (''sharru'') of Hanigalbat. He resided in the newly built Assyrian administrative centre at [[Tell Sabi Abyad]], governed by the Assyrian steward [[Tammitte]]. Assyrians maintained not only military and political control, but seem to have dominated trade as well, as no Hurrian or Mitanni names appear in private records of Shalmaneser's time.\n\nUnder the Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (c. 1243&ndash;1207 BC) there were again numerous deportations from Hanigalbat (east Mitanni) to Ashur, probably in connection with the construction of a new palace. As the royal inscriptions mention an invasion of Hanigalbat by a Hittite king, there may have been a new rebellion, or at least native support of a Hittite invasion. The Mitanni towns may have been sacked at this time, as destruction levels have been found in some excavations that cannot be dated with precision, however. [[Tell Sabi Abyad]], seat of the Assyrian government in Mitanni in the times of Shalmaneser, was deserted between 1200 and 1150 BC.\n\nIn the time of [[Ashur-nirari III]] (c. 1200 BC, the beginning [[Bronze Age collapse]]), the [[Phrygians]] and others invaded and destroyed the [[Hittite Empire]], already weakened by defeats against Assyria. Some parts of Assyrian-ruled Hanigalbat was temporarily lost to the Phrygians also; however, the Assyrians defeated the Phrygians and regained these colonies. The Hurrians still held [[Katmuhu]] and [[Paphu]]. In the transitional period to the [[Early Iron Age]], Mitanni was settled by invading [[Aramaeans]].\n\n==Indo-Aryan superstrate==\n\n{{main|Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni}}\nSome theonyms, proper names and other terminology of the Mitanni exhibit close similarities to [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], suggesting that an [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] elite imposed itself over the [[Hurrian]] population in the course of the [[Indo-Aryan migration|Indo-Aryan expansion]]. In a treaty between the [[Hittites]] and the Mitanni, the deities [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Indra]], and [[Nasatya]] ([[Asvins|Ashvins]]) are invoked. [[Kikkuli]]'s horse training text includes technical terms such as ''aika'' (''eka'', one), ''tera'' (''tri'', three), ''panza'' (''pancha'', five), ''satta'' (''sapta'', seven), ''na'' (''nava'', nine), ''vartana'' (''vartana'', turn, round in the horse race). The numeral aika \"one\" is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has \"aiva\") in general.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Thieme |title=The 'Aryan' Gods of the Mitanni Treaties |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |volume=80 |issue=4 |year=1960 |pages=301\u201317 |doi=10.2307/595878 }}</ref>\n\nAnother text has ''babru'' (''babhru'', brown), ''parita'' (''palita'', grey), and ''pinkara'' (''pingala'', red).

Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of [[Amorite]]<ref>{{ cite book | title = The Kingdom of the Hittites | author = Trevor Bryce | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 98 }}</ref> [[First Babylonian dynasty|Babylon]] and a series of ineffectual [[Assyria]]n kings created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia.\n\nAt the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thutmosids]]. However, with the ascent of the [[Hittite Empire]], Mitanni and Egypt struck an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, Mitanni had outposts centred on its capital, [[Washukanni]], whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the [[headwaters]] of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]]. The Mitanni dynasty ruled over the northern [[Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system|Euphrates-Tigris]] region between c. 1475 and c. 1275 BC. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks and was reduced to the status of a province of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]].\n\nWhile the Mitanni kings were [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], they used the language of the local people, which was at that time a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language, Hurrian. Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the [[Levant]] of a distinct pottery type.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Mitanni controlled [[trade route]]s down the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] to [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and up the [[Euphrates]] from there to [[Carchemish]]. For a time they also controlled the [[Assyria]]n territories of the upper [[Tigris]] and its headwaters at [[Nineveh]], [[Erbil]], [[Assur]] and [[Nuzi]]. Their allies included [[Kizuwatna]] in southeastern [[Anatolia]]; Mukish, which stretched between [[Ugarit]] and [[Quatna]] west of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] to the sea; and the [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]], which controlled the east bank of the Orontes from [[Alalah]] down through [[Aleppo]], [[Ebla]] and [[Hama]] to Qatna and [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. To the east, they had good relations with the [[Kassites]].<ref>Michael Roaf, ''Cambridge Atlas of Mesopotamia'', maps, pp. 134&ndash;135.</ref> The land of Mitanni in northern Syria extended from the [[Taurus mountains]] to its west and as far east as Nuzi (modern [[Kirkuk]]) and the river Tigris in the east. In the south, it extended from Aleppo across (''Nuhasse'') to Mari on the Euphrates in the east. Its centre was in the Khabur River valley, with two capitals:  [[Taite]] and [[Washukanni]], called ''Taidu'' and ''Ussukana'' respectively in Assyrian sources. The whole area supported agriculture without artificial irrigation and cattle, sheep and goats were raised. It is very similar to Assyria in climate, and was settled by both indigenous Hurrian and [[Amorites|Amoritic]]-speaking (''Amurru'') populations.\n\n==Name==\nThe Mitanni kingdom was referred to as the '''Maryannu, Nahrin''' or '''Mitanni''' by the [[Egyptians]], the '''Hurri''' by the Hittites, and the '''Hanigalbat''' by the Assyrians. The different names seem to have referred to the same kingdom and were used interchangeably, according to Michael C. Astour.<ref>Astour, \"\u1e2aattusilis\u0306, \u1e2aalab, and \u1e2aanigalbat\" ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' '''31'''.2 (April 1972:102&ndash;109) p 103.</ref> Hittite annals mention a people called ''Hurri'' (''{{transl|hit|\u1e2au-ur-ri}}''), located in northeastern Syria. A Hittite fragment, probably from the time of [[Mursili I]], mentions a \"King of the Hurri\". The [[Akkadian language|Assyro-Akkadian]] version of the text renders \"Hurri\" as ''Hanigalbat''. Tushratta, who styles himself \"king of Mitanni\" in his [[Amarna letters|Akkadian Amarna letters]], refers to his kingdom as Hanigalbat.<ref>Astour 1972:103, noting Amarna letters 18:9; 20:17;29:49.</ref>\n\nEgyptian sources call Mitanni \"''nhrn''{{-\"}}, which is usually pronounced as ''[[Naharin]](a)'',<ref>Faulkner, Raymond O. ''A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian.'' p.135. Griffith Institute, Oxford, 1962; [http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/Kitchen%20-%20New%20Kingdom%20Topographical%20Lists.pdf Egyptian New Kingdom Topographical lists], by Kenneth Kitchen, p.5 bottom paragraph, University of Memphis</ref> from the [[Akkadian language|Assyro-Akkadian]] word for \"river\", cf.

Vandier, ''L'\u00c9gypte'', 4th ed. (Paris) 1962: 396f.</ref> Helck believes that this was the expedition mentioned by [[Amenhotep II]].\n\nThe reading of the Assyrian term ''\u1e2aanigalbat'' has a history of multiple renderings. The first portion has been connected to, \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udd29\ud808\ude61}} ''{{transl|akk|\u1e2aa-nu}}''\", \"Hanu\" or \"Hana\", first attested in [[Mari]] to describe nomadic inhabitants along the southern shore of the northern [[Euphrates]] region, near the vicinity of [[Terqa]] and the [[Khabur_(Euphrates)|Khabur]] River. The term developed into more than just a designation for a people group, but also took on a topographic aspect as well. In the Middle Assyrian period, a phrase \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udf37\ud808\uddb3\ud808\udd29\ud808\ude61\ud808\udc2d\ud808\udeeb}}\" ''{{transl|akk|<sup>URU</sup>KUR \u1e2aa-nu AN.TA}}''\", \"cities of the Upper Hanu\" has suggested that there was a distinction between two different Hanu's, likely across each side of the river. This northern side designation spans much of the core territory of Mitanni state. \n\nThe two signs that have lead to variant readings are \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udcf2}} ''{{transl|akk|gal}}''\" and its alternative form \"{{cuneiform|\ud808\udd97}} ''{{transl|akk|gal<sub>9</sub>}}''\". The first attempts at decipherment in the late 1800s, rendered forms interpreting \"''gal''\", meaning \"great\" in Sumerian, as a logogram for Akkadian \"''rab''\" having the same meaning; \"\u1e2aani-Rabbat\" denoting \"''the Great Hani''\". [[J\u00f8rgen Alexander Knudtzon|J.A. Knudtzon]] and [[E.A. Speiser]] after him, supported instead the reading of \"''gal''\" on the basis of its alternative spelling with \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\", which has since become the majority view. \n\nThere is still a difficulty to explain the suffix \"''-bat''\" if the first sign did not end in \"''b''\", or the apparent similarity to Semitic feminine ending \"''-at''\", if derived from a Hurrian word. More recently scholar [[Miguel Val\u00e9rio]] of the [[New University of Lisbon]], provided detailed support in favor of the older reading. The re-reading makes argument on basis of frequency, where \"''gal''\" not \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\", is far more numerous; the later being the deviation found in six documents, all from the periphery of the Akkadian sphere of influence. Additionally argued, although graphically distinct, there is a high degree of overlap between the two signs, as \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\" denotes \"''dannum''\" or \"\"strong\"\" opposed to \"great\", easily being used as synonyms. Both signs also represent correlative readings; alternative readings of \"''gal<sub>9</sub>''\" include \"''rib''\" and \"''rip''\", just like \"''gal''\" being read as \"''rab''\".\n\n== People ==\n[[File:Cylinder seal,ca. 16th\u201315th century BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal, c. 16th\u201315th century BC, Mitanni]]\nThe ethnicity of the people of Mitanni is difficult to ascertain.

There is no indication that these persons owed allegiance to the political entity of Mitanni; although the [[German language|German]] term ''Auslandshurriter'' (\"Hurrian expatriates\") has been used by some authors. In the 14th century BC numerous city-states in northern Syria and Canaan were ruled by persons with Hurrian and some Indo-Aryan names. If this can be taken to mean that the population of these states was Hurrian as well, then it is possible that these entities were a part of a larger polity with a shared Hurrian identity. This is often assumed, but without a critical examination of the sources. Differences in dialect and regionally different pantheons (''Hepat/Shawushka, Sharruma/Tilla'' etc.) point to the existence of several groups of Hurrian speakers.\n\n==History==\n\nNo native sources for the history of Mitanni have been found so far. The account is mainly based on Assyrian, Hittite, and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] sources, as well as inscriptions from nearby places in Syria. Often it is not even possible to establish synchronicity between the rulers of different countries and cities, let alone give uncontested absolute dates. The definition and history of Mitanni is further beset by a lack of differentiation between linguistic, ethnic and political groups.\n\n===Summary===\n[[File:Cylinder seal and modern impression Nude male, griffins, monkey, lion, goat, ca 15th 14th century BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal and modern impression: nude male, griffins, monkey, lion, goat, c. 15th/14th century BC, Mitanni]]\nIt is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of [[Babylon]] due to its sacking by Hittite king [[Mursili I]], and the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo ([[Yamhad]]), the weak middle Assyrian kings who succeeded [[Puzur-Ashur III]], and the internal strife of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper [[Mesopotamia]]. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni.\n\nKing [[Barattarna]] of Mitanni expanded the kingdom west to Aleppo and made the [[Canaan]]ite{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} king [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]] his vassal. The state of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the west also shifted its allegiance to Mitanni, and Assyria in the east had become largely a Mitannian vassal state by the mid-15th century BC. The nation grew stronger during the reign of [[Shaushtatar]], but the Hurrians were keen to keep the Hittites inside the Anatolian highland. Kizzuwatna in the west and [[Ishuwa]] in the north were important allies against the hostile Hittites.\n\nAfter a few successful clashes with the Egyptians  over the control of Syria, Mitanni sought peace with them, and an alliance was formed. During the reign of [[Shuttarna II|Shuttarna]], in the early 14th century BC, the relationship was very amicable, and he sent his daughter Gilu-Hepa to Egypt for a marriage with Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]. Mitanni was now at its peak of power.\n \nHowever, by the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390\u20131366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna II]], who called himself king of the [[Hurri]] while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.<ref>George Roux, '' Ancient Iraq''</ref>\nKing [[Ashur-Uballit I]] (1365\u20131330 BC) of [[Assyria]] attacked Shuttarna and annexed Mitanni territory in the middle of the 14th century BC, making Assyria once more a great power.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |date=2014 |title=[[1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed]] |url= |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=61 |isbn=1400849985 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nAt the death of Shuttarna, Mitanni was ravaged by a war of succession. Eventually Tushratta, a son of Shuttarna, ascended the throne, but the kingdom had been weakened considerably and both the Hittite and Assyrian threats increased. At the same time, the diplomatic relationship with Egypt went cold, the Egyptians fearing the growing power of the Hittites and Assyrians. The Hittite king [[Suppiluliuma I]] invaded the Mitanni vassal states in northern Syria and replaced them with loyal subjects.\n\nIn the capital [[Washukanni]], a new power struggle broke out. The Hittites and the Assyrians supported different pretenders to the throne. Finally a Hittite army conquered the capital Washukanni and installed [[Shattiwaza]], the son of Tushratta, as their vassal king of Mitanni in the late 14th century BC. The kingdom had by now been reduced to the Khabur Valley. The Assyrians had not given up their claim on Mitanni, and in the 13th century BC, [[Shalmaneser I]] annexed the kingdom.\n\n===Early kingdom===\n\nAs early as [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] times, Hurrians are known to have lived east of the river Tigris on the northern rim of Mesopotamia, and in the Khabur Valley. The group which became Mitanni gradually moved south into Mesopotamia before the 17th century BC.\n\nHurrians are mentioned in the private [[Nuzi]] texts, in [[Ugarit]], and the Hittite archives in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y]]). [[Cuneiform (script)|Cuneiform]] texts from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] mention rulers of city-states in upper Mesopotamia with both ''Amurru'' (Amorite) and Hurrian names. Rulers with Hurrian names are also attested for [[Urshu]]m and [[Hassum]], and tablets from [[Alalakh]] (layer VII, from the later part of the Old [[Babylonia]]n period) mention people with Hurrian names at the mouth of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]]. There is no evidence for any invasion from the North-east. Generally, these [[onomastic]] sources have been taken as evidence for a Hurrian expansion to the South and the West.\n\nA Hittite fragment, probably from the time of [[Mursili I]], mentions a \"King of the Hurrians\" (''LUGAL ER\u00cdN.ME\u0160 Hurri''). This terminology was last used for King Tushratta of Mitanni, in a letter in the Amarna archives. The normal title of the king was 'King of the Hurri-men' (without the determinative ''KUR'' indicating a country).\n\nIt is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of [[Babylon]] due to the Hittite sack by [[Mursili I]] and the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo ([[Yamkhad]]), the weak middle Assyrian kings, and the internal strifes of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper Mesopotamia. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni. The legendary founder of the Mitannian dynasty was a king called [[Kirta]], who was followed by a king [[Shuttarna I|Shuttarna]]. Nothing is known about these early kings.\n\n===Barattarna / Parsha(ta)tar ===\n{{Main|Parshatatar}}\n\nKing Barattarna is known from a cuneiform tablet in Nuzi and an inscription by [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050414015739/http://www.geocities.com/farfarer2001/alalakh/idrimi_inscription.htm ''IDRIMI INSCRIPTION'']</ref>  Egyptian sources do not mention his name; that he was the king of Naharin whom [[Thutmose III]] fought against in the 15th century BC can only be deduced from assumptions. Whether Parsha(ta)tar, known from another Nuzi inscription, is the same as Barattarna, or a different king, is debated.\n\nUnder the rule of Thutmose III, Egyptian troops crossed the Euphrates and entered the core lands of Mitanni. At [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], he fought an alliance of 330 Mitanni princes and tribal leaders under the ruler of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. See [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)]]. Mitanni had sent troops as well. Whether this was done because of existing treaties, or only in reaction to a common threat, remains open to debate. The Egyptian victory opened the way north.\n\nThutmose III again waged war in Mitanni in the 33rd year of his rule. The Egyptian army crossed the Euphrates at [[Carchemish]] and reached a town called Iryn (maybe present day Erin, 20&nbsp;km northwest of Aleppo.) They sailed down the Euphrates to [[Emar]] (Meskene) and then returned home via Mitanni. A hunt for elephants at Lake Nija was important enough to be included in the annals. This was impressive propaganda, but did not lead to any permanent rule.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Only the area at the [[Orontes River|middle Orontes]] and [[Phoenicia]] became part of Egyptian territory.\n\nVictories over Mitanni are recorded from the Egyptian campaigns in ''Nuhasse'' (middle part of Syria). Again, this did not lead to permanent territorial gains. Barattarna or his son Shaushtatar controlled the North Mitanni interior up to ''Nuhasse'', and the coastal territories from [[Kizzuwatna]] to Alalakh in the kingdom of Mukish at the mouth of the Orontes. Idrimi of Alalakh, returning from Egyptian exile, could only ascend his throne with Barattarna's consent. While he got to rule Mukish and Ama'u, [[Aleppo]] remained with Mitanni.\n\n===Shaushtatar===\n{{Main|Shaushtatar}}\n[[File:Royal seal of \u0160au\u0161tatar of Mitanni.svg|thumb|right|Shaushtatar's royal seal.]]\n\n[[Shaushtatar]], king of Mitanni, sacked the Assyrian capital of [[Assur]] some time in the 15th century during the reign of [[Nur-ili]], and took the silver and golden doors of the royal palace to [[Washukanni]].<ref>Cline 2014, p. 61</ref> This is known from a later Hittite document, the Suppililiuma-Shattiwaza treaty. After the sack of Assur, Assyria may have paid tribute to Mitanni up to the time of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390&ndash;1366 BC). There is no trace of that in the Assyrian king lists; therefore it is probable that Ashur was ruled by a native Assyrian dynasty owing sporadic allegiance to the house of Shaushtatar. While a sometime vassal of Mitanni, the temple of [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] and [[Shamash]] was built in Ashur.\n\nThe states of [[Aleppo]] in the west, and [[Nuzi]] and [[Arrapha]] in the east, seem to have been incorporated into Mitanni under Shaushtatar as well. The palace of the [[Crown Prince|crown prince]], the governor of Arrapha has been excavated. A letter from Shaushtatar was discovered in the house of Shilwe-Teshup. His [[Seal (device)|seal]] shows heroes and winged geniuses fighting lions and other animals, as well as a [[winged sun]]. This style, with a multitude of figures distributed over the whole of the available space, is taken as typically Hurrian. A second seal, belonging to Shuttarna I, but used by Shaushtatar, found in Alalakh, shows a more traditional Assyro-Akkadian style.\n\nThe military superiority of Mitanni was probably based on the use of two-wheeled war-[[chariots]], driven by the 'Marjannu' people. A text on the training of war-horses, written by a certain \"[[Kikkuli]] the Mitannian\" has been found in the archives recovered at [[Hattusa]]. More speculative is the attribution of the introduction of the chariot in Mesopotamia to early Mitanni.\n\nDuring the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II]], Mitanni seems to have regained influence in the middle Orontes valley that had been conquered by Thutmose III. Amenhotep fought in Syria in 1425 BC, presumably against Mitanni as well, but did not reach the Euphrates.\n\n===Artatama I and Shuttarna II===\n{{Main|Artatama I|Shuttarna II}}\n\nLater on, Egypt and Mitanni became allies, and King [[Shuttarna II]] himself was received at the Egyptian court. Amicable letters, sumptuous gifts, and letters asking for sumptuous gifts were exchanged. Mitanni was especially interested in Egyptian gold. This culminated in a number of royal marriages: the daughter of King [[Artatama I]] was married to [[Thutmose IV of Egypt|Thutmose IV]]. Kilu-Hepa, or [[Gilukhipa]], the daughter of Shuttarna II, was married to Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]], who ruled in the early 14th century BC. In a later royal marriage Tadu-Hepa, or [[Tadukhipa]], the daughter of Tushratta, was sent to Egypt.\n\nWhen [[Amenhotep III]] fell ill, the king of Mitanni sent him a statue of the goddess Shaushka ([[Ishtar]]) of [[Nineveh]] that was reputed to cure diseases. A more or less permanent border between Egypt and Mitanni seems to have existed near [[Qatna]] on the Orontes River; [[Ugarit]] was part of Egyptian territory.\n\nThe reason Mitanni sought peace with Egypt may have been trouble with the Hittites. A Hittite king called [[Tudhaliya]] conducted campaigns against Kizzuwatna, [[Arzawa]], [[Ishuwa]], Aleppo, and maybe against Mitanni itself. Kizzuwatna may have fallen to the Hittites at that time.\n\n===Artashumara and Tushratta===\n{{Main|Artashumara|Tushratta}}\n[[Image:Cuneiform letter to Amenhotep III.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Cuneiform tablet containing a letter from Tushratta of Mitanni to Amenhotep III (of 13 letters of King Tushratta).]]\n\nArtashumara followed his father Shuttarna II on the throne, but was murdered by a certain UD-hi, or Uthi. It is uncertain what intrigues that followed, but UD-hi then placed [[Tushratta]], another son of Shuttarna, on the throne. Probably, he was quite young at the time and was intended to serve as a figurehead only. However, he managed to dispose of the murderer, possibly with the help of his Egyptian father-in-law, but this is sheer speculation.\n\nThe Egyptians may have suspected the mighty days of Mitanni were about to end. In order to protect their Syrian border zone the new Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] instead received envoys from the resurgent powers of the Hittites and Assyria. From the [[Amarna letters]] it is known that Tushratta's desperate claim for a gold statue from Akhenaten developed into a major diplomatic crisis.\n\nThe unrest weakened the Mitannian control of their vassal states, and [[Aziru]] of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] seized the opportunity and made a secret deal with the Hittite king [[Suppiluliuma I]]. [[Kizzuwatna]], which had seceded from the Hittites, was reconquered by Suppiluliuma. In what has been called his first Syrian campaign, Suppiluliuma then invaded the western Euphrates valley, and conquered the ''Amurru'' and ''Nuhasse'' in Mitanni.\n\nAccording to the later Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, Suppiluliuma had made a treaty with [[Artatama II]], a rival of Tushratta. Nothing is known of this Artatama's previous life or connection, if any, to the royal family. He is called \"king of the Hurri\", while Tushratta went by the title \"King of Mitanni\". This must have disagreed with Tushratta. Suppiluliuma began to plunder the lands on the west bank of the Euphrates, and annexed [[Mount Lebanon]]. Tushratta threatened to raid beyond the Euphrates if even a single lamb or kid was stolen.\nBy the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390&ndash;1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between Tushratta and his brother Artatama II and after this his son Shuttarna III, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs\n\nSuppiluliuma then recounts how the land of [[Ishuwa]] on the upper Euphrates had seceded in the time of his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it had failed. In the time of his father, other cities had rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have defeated them, but the survivors had fled to the territory of Ishuwa, that must have been part of Mitanni. A clause to return fugitives is part of many treaties between sovereign states and between rulers and vassal states, so perhaps the harbouring of fugitives by Ishuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion.\n\nA Hittite army crossed the border, entered Ishuwa and returned the fugitives (or deserters or exile governments) to Hittite rule. \"I freed the lands that I captured; they dwelt in their places. All the people whom I released rejoined their peoples, and Hatti incorporated their territories.\"\n\nThe Hittite army then marched through various districts towards [[Washukanni]]. Suppiluliuma claims to have plundered the area, and to have brought loot, captives, cattle, sheep and horses back to Hatti. He also claims that Tushratta fled, though obviously he failed to capture the capital. While the campaign weakened Mitanni, it did not endanger its existence.\n\nIn a second campaign, the Hittites again crossed the Euphrates and subdued [[Aleppo]], [[Mukish]], [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]], [[Arahati]], [[Apina]], and Qatna, as well as some cities whose names have not been preserved. The booty from Arahati included charioteers, who were brought to Hatti together with all their possessions. While it was common practice to incorporate enemy soldiers in the army, this might point to a Hittite attempt to counter the most potent weapon of Mitanni, the war-chariots, by building up or strengthening their own chariot forces.\n\nAll in all, Suppiluliuma claims to have conquered the lands \"from Mount Lebanon and from the far bank of the Euphrates\". But Hittite governors or vassal rulers are mentioned only for some cities and kingdoms. While the Hittites made some territorial gains in western Syria, it seems unlikely that they established a permanent rule east of the Euphrates.\n\n===Shattiwaza / Kurtiwaza===\n{{Main|Shattiwaza}}\n[[File:Cylinder seal, ca. 1500\u20131350 BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal, c. 1500\u20131350 BC, Mitanni]]\nA son of Tushratta conspired with his subjects, and killed his father in order to become king. His brother [[Shattiwaza]] was forced to flee. In the unrest that followed, the Assyrians asserted themselves under [[Ashur-uballit I]], and he invaded the country; the pretender Artatama/Atratama II gained ascendancy, followed by his son Shuttarna. Suppiluliuma claims that \"the entire land of Mittanni went to ruin, and the land of Assyria and the land of [[Alshi]] divided it between them\", but this sounds more like wishful thinking. Although Assyria annexed Mitanni territory, the kingdom survived. Shuttarna wisely maintained good relations with Assyria, and returned to it the palace doors of Ashur, that had been taken by Shaushtatar. Such booty formed a powerful political symbol in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nThe fugitive Shattiwaza may have gone to [[Babylon]] first, but eventually ended up at the court of the Hittite king, who married him to one of his daughters. The treaty between Suppiluliuma of Hatti and Shattiwaza of Mitanni has been preserved and is one of the main sources on this period. After the conclusion of the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, [[Piyassili]], a son of Suppiluliuma, led a Hittite army into Mitanni. According to Hittite sources, Piyassili and Shattiwaza crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish, then marched against [[Irridu]] in Hurrian territory. They sent messengers from the west bank of the Euphrates and seemed to have expected a friendly welcome, but the people were loyal to their new ruler, influenced, as Suppiluliuma claims, by the riches of Tushratta. \"Why are you coming? If you are coming for battle, come, but you shall not return to the land of the Great King!\" they taunted. Shuttarna had sent men to strengthen the troops and chariots of the district of Irridu, but the Hittite army won the battle, and the people of Irridu sued for peace.\n\nMeanwhile, an Assyrian army \"led by a single charioteer\" marched on the capital Washukanni. It seems that Shuttarna had sought Assyrian aid in the face of the Hittite threat. Possibly the force sent did not meet his expectations, or he changed his mind. In any case, the Assyrian army was refused entrance, and set instead to besiege the capital. This seems to have turned the mood against Shuttarna; perhaps the majority of the inhabitants of Washukanni decided they were better off with the Hittite Empire than with their former subjects. In any case, a messenger was sent to Piyassili and Shattiwaza at Irridu, who delivered his message in public, at the city gate. Piyassili and Shattiwaza marched on Washukanni, and the cities of Harran and Pakarripa seem to have surrendered to them.\n\nWhile at Pakarripa, a desolate country where the troops suffered hunger, they received word of an Assyrian advance, but the enemy never materialised. The allies pursued the retreating Assyrian troops to Nilap-ini but could not force a confrontation. The Assyrians seem to have retreated home in the face of the superior force of the Hittites.\n\nShattiwaza became king of Mitanni, but after Suppililiuma had taken Carchemish and the land west of the Euphrates, that were governed by his son Piyassili, Mitanni was restricted to the Khabur River and [[Balikh River]] valleys, and became more and more dependent on their allies in [[Hattarsus]]. Some scholars speak of a Hittite puppet kingdom, a buffer-state against the powerful Assyria.\n\nAssyria under [[Ashur-uballit I]] began to infringe on Mitanni as well. Its vassal state of [[Nuzi]] east of the Tigris was conquered and destroyed. According to the Hittitologist [[Trevor R. Bryce]], Mitanni (or Hanigalbat as it was known) was permanently lost to Assyria during the reign of [[Mursili III]] of the Hittites, who was defeated by the Assyrians in the process. Its loss was a major blow to Hittite prestige in the ancient world and undermined the young king's authority over his kingdom.\n\n===Shattuara I===\n{{Main|Shattuara}}\n\nThe royal inscriptions of the Assyrian king [[Adad-nirari I]] (c. 1307&ndash;1275 BC) relate how the vassal king [[Shattuara]] of Mitanni rebelled and committed hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara was related to the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars think that he was the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza's one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. This must have happened during the reign of the Hittite King [[Mursili II]], but there is no exact date.\n\n===Wasashatta===\n{{Main|Wasashatta}}\nDespite Assyrian strength, Shattuara's son [[Wasashatta]] attempted to rebel. He sought Hittite help, but that kingdom was preoccupied with internal struggles, possibly connected with the usurpation of [[Hattusili III]], who had driven his nephew [[Mursili III|Urhi-Teshup]] into exile. The Hittites took Wasashatta's money but did not help, as Adad-nirari's inscriptions gleefully note.\n\nThe Assyrians expanded further, and conquered the royal city of [[Taite|Taidu]], and took [[Washukanni]], [[Amasakku]], [[Tell Barri|Kahat]], [[Shuru, Fars|Shuru]], [[Nabula]], [[Hurra, Syria|Hurra]] and [[Shuduhu]] as well. They conquered [[Irridu]], destroyed it utterly and [[salting the earth|sowed salt over it]].\nThe wife, sons and daughters of Wasashatta were taken to [[Ashur]], together with much booty and other prisoners. As Wasashatta himself is not mentioned, he must have escaped capture. There are letters of Wasashatta in the Hittite archives. Some scholars think he became ruler of a reduced Mitanni state called [[Shubria]].\n\nWhile [[Adad-nirari I]] conquered the Mitanni heartland between the [[Balikh]] and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] from the [[Hittites]], he does not seem to have crossed the Euphrates, and [[Carchemish]] remained part of the Hittite kingdom. With his victory over Mitanni, Adad-nirari claimed the title of Great King (''sharru rab\u00fb'') in letters to the Hittite rulers.\n\n===Shattuara II===\n{{Main|Shattuara II}}\n\nIn the reign of [[Shalmaneser I]] (1270s&ndash;1240s) King [[Shattuara]] of Mitanni, a son or nephew of Wasahatta, rebelled against the Assyrian yoke with the help of the Hittites and the nomadic [[Ahlamu]] ([[Arameans]]) around 1250 BC.<ref>Bryce 2005, p. 314</ref> His army was well prepared; they had occupied all the mountain passes and waterholes, so that the Assyrian army suffered from thirst during their advance.\n\nNevertheless, Shalmaneser I won a crushing victory for Assyria over the Hittites and Mitanni. He claims to have slain 14,400 men; the rest were blinded and carried away. His inscriptions mention the conquest of nine fortified temples; 180 Hurrian cities were \"turned into rubble mounds\", and Shalmaneser \"\u2026slaughtered like sheep the armies of the Hittites and the Ahlamu his allies\u2026\". The cities from Taidu to [[Irridu]] were captured, as well as all of mount Kashiar to Eluhat and the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates. Another inscription mentions the construction of a temple to the Assyrian god [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]] in Kahat, a city of Mitanni that must have been occupied as well.\n\n===Hanigalbat as an Assyrian province===\nA part of the population was deported and served as cheap labour. Administrative documents mention barley allotted to \"uprooted men\", deportees from Mitanni. For example, the Assyrian governor of the city [[Nahur (Mesopotamia)|Nahur]], [[Meli-Sah]], received barley to be distributed to deported persons from [[Shuduhu]] \"as seed, food for their oxen and for themselves\".\nThe Assyrians built a line of frontier fortifications against the Hittites on the [[Balikh River]].\n\nMitanni was now ruled by the Assyrian grand-vizier [[Il\u012b-pad\u00e2]], a member of the royal family, who took the title of king (''sharru'') of Hanigalbat. He resided in the newly built Assyrian administrative centre at [[Tell Sabi Abyad]], governed by the Assyrian steward [[Tammitte]]. Assyrians maintained not only military and political control, but seem to have dominated trade as well, as no Hurrian or Mitanni names appear in private records of Shalmaneser's time.\n\nUnder the Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (c. 1243&ndash;1207 BC) there were again numerous deportations from Hanigalbat (east Mitanni) to Ashur, probably in connection with the construction of a new palace. As the royal inscriptions mention an invasion of Hanigalbat by a Hittite king, there may have been a new rebellion, or at least native support of a Hittite invasion. The Mitanni towns may have been sacked at this time, as destruction levels have been found in some excavations that cannot be dated with precision, however. [[Tell Sabi Abyad]], seat of the Assyrian government in Mitanni in the times of Shalmaneser, was deserted between 1200 and 1150 BC.\n\nIn the time of [[Ashur-nirari III]] (c. 1200 BC, the beginning [[Bronze Age collapse]]), the [[Phrygians]] and others invaded and destroyed the [[Hittite Empire]], already weakened by defeats against Assyria. Some parts of Assyrian-ruled Hanigalbat was temporarily lost to the Phrygians also; however, the Assyrians defeated the Phrygians and regained these colonies. The Hurrians still held [[Katmuhu]] and [[Paphu]]. In the transitional period to the [[Early Iron Age]], Mitanni was settled by invading [[Aramaeans]].\n\n==Indo-Aryan superstrate==\n\n{{main|Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni}}\nSome theonyms, proper names and other terminology of the Mitanni exhibit close similarities to [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], suggesting that an [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] elite imposed itself over the [[Hurrian]] population in the course of the [[Indo-Aryan migration|Indo-Aryan expansion]]. In a treaty between the [[Hittites]] and the Mitanni, the deities [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Indra]], and [[Nasatya]] ([[Asvins|Ashvins]]) are invoked. [[Kikkuli]]'s horse training text includes technical terms such as ''aika'' (''eka'', one), ''tera'' (''tri'', three), ''panza'' (''pancha'', five), ''satta'' (''sapta'', seven), ''na'' (''nava'', nine), ''vartana'' (''vartana'', turn, round in the horse race). The numeral aika \"one\" is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has \"aiva\") in general.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Thieme |title=The 'Aryan' Gods of the Mitanni Treaties |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |volume=80 |issue=4 |year=1960 |pages=301\u201317 |doi=10.2307/595878 }}</ref>\n\nAnother text has ''babru'' (''babhru'', brown), ''parita'' (''palita'', grey), and ''pinkara'' (''pingala'', red).

It is possible that the settlement origins of Trabzon go back to these tribes. The [[Hayasa]], who had been in conflict with the Central-Anatolian [[Hittites]] in the 14th century BCE, are believed to have lived in the area south of Trabzon. Later Greek authors mentioned the [[Macrones]] and the [[Chalybes]] as native peoples. One of the dominant Caucasian groups to the east were the [[Laz people|Laz]], who were part of the monarchy of the [[Colchis]], together with other related [[Kartvelians|Georgian]] peoples.<ref>''Phoenix: The Peoples of the Hills: Ancient Ararat and Caucasus'' by Charles Burney, David Marshall Lang, Phoenix Press; New Ed edition (December 31, 2001)</ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition (December 1994), Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}, page 45</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timothygrove.blogspot.ro/2012_07_01_archive.html|title=A Star in the East|website=TimothyGrove.Blogspot.ro|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Greek sources{{citation needed|date=March 2019|reason=What sources?}} the city was founded in [[classical antiquity]] in 756 BCE as T\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (''Trapezous''), by [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] traders from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]]. It was one of a number (about ten) of Milesian ''emporia'' or [[colonies in antiquity|trading colonies]] along the shores of the Black Sea. Others included [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]] and [[Cyzicus]] in the [[Dardanelles]], and nearby [[Giresun|Kerasous]]. Like most [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] colonies, the city was a small enclave of Greek life, and not an empire unto its own, in the later European sense of the word. As a colony Trapezous initially paid tribute to Sinope, but early banking (money-changing) activity is suggested occurring in the city already in the 4th century BCE, according to a silver [[drachma]] coin from Trapezus in the [[British Museum]], London. [[Cyrus the Great]] added the city to the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and was possibly the first ruler to consolidate the eastern Black Sea region into a single political entity (a [[satrapy]]).\n\n[[File:The Return of the Ten Thousand under Xenophon.jpg|thumb|left|Th\u00e1latta! Th\u00e1latta! (\"The Sea! The Sea!\").<br> Trebizond was the first Greek city the [[Ten Thousand]] reached on their retreat from Persia. 19th c. illustration by Herman Vogel.]]\nTrebizond's trade partners included the [[Mossynoeci]]. When [[Xenophon]] and the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]] mercenaries were fighting their way out of [[Persia]], the first Greek city they reached was Trebizond (Xenophon, ''Anabasis'', 5.5.10). The city and the local Mossynoeci had become estranged from the Mossynoecian capital, to the point of civil war. Xenophon's force resolved this in the rebels' favor, and so in Trebizond's interest.\n\nUp until the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] the city remained under the dominion of the Achaemenids. While the Pontus was not directly affected by the war, its cities gained independence as a result of it. Local ruling families continued to claim partial Persian heritage, and Persian culture had some lasting influence on the city; the holy springs of mt. Minthrion to the east of the old town were devoted to the Persian-Anatolian Greek god [[Mithra]]. In the 2nd century BCE the city with its natural harbours was added to the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] by [[Pharnaces I of Pontus|Pharnaces I]]. [[Mithridates VI Eupator]] made it the home port of the Pontic fleet, in his quest to remove the Romans from Anatolia.\n\nAfter the defeat of Mithridates in 66 BCE the city was first handed to the Galatians, but it was soon returned to the grandson of Mithradates, and subsequently became part of the new client Kingdom of Pontus. When the kingdom was finally annexed to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Galatia]] two centuries later, the fleet passed to new commanders, becoming the ''[[Roman Navy#Classis Pontica|Classis Pontica]]''. The city received the status of [[Free city (classical antiquity)|civitas libera]], extending it judicial autonomy and the right to mint its own coin. Trabzon gained importance for its access to roads leading over the [[Zigana Pass]] to the [[Armenia]]n frontier or the upper [[Euphrates]] valley. New roads were constructed from [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] under the rule of [[Vespasian]]. In the next century, the emperor [[Hadrian]] commissioned improvements to give the city a more structured harbor.<ref name=Miller-9>[[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]], ''Trebizond: The Last Greek Empire'', 1926, (Chicago: Argonaut Publishers, 1968), p. 9</ref> The emperor visited the city in the year 129 as part of his inspection of the eastern border ([[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]). A [[mithraeum]] now serves as a crypt for the church and monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (''K\u0131zlar Manast\u0131r\u0131'') in nearby Kizlara, east of the citadel and south of the modern harbor.\n\n[[File:Aquila, Valerian, Eugene and Candidus of Trebizond (Menologion of Basil II).jpg|thumb|left|Martyrdom of Eugenius, Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila.

Only in the reign of [[Diocletian]] appears an inscription alluding to the restoration of the city; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] could only write of Trebizond that it was \"not an obscure town.\" [[Christianity]] had reached Trebizond by the third century, for during the reign of Diocletian occurred the martyrdom of [[Eugenius of Trebizond|Eugenius]] and his associates Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila.<ref>Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 10</ref> Eugenius had destroyed the statue of [[Mithras]] which overlooked the city from [[Mount Minthrion]] (Boztepe), and became the patron saint of the city after his death. Early Christians sought refuge in the Pontic Mountains south of the city, where they established [[Vazelon Monastery]] in 270 AD and [[Sumela Monastery]] in 386 AD. As early as the [[First Council of Nicea]], Trebizond had its own bishop.<ref name=\"Hewsen46\">Hewsen, 46</ref> Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the [[Metropolitan Bishop]] of [[Poti]].<ref name=\"Hewsen46\" /> Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of [[Lazica]].<ref name=\"Hewsen46\" />\n\n===Byzantine period===\n{{Main|Chaldia}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width1 = 220\n | width2 = 220\n | image1 = Hagia Anna Trabzon.JPG\n | caption1 = [[Saint Anne Church, Trabzon|Saint Anne Church]] to the east of the walled city is the oldest church in the city, possibly dating back to the 6th or 7th century.\n | image2 = Trabzon,Ortahisar1.jpg\n | caption2 = The 10th-century cathedral Panaghia Chrysokephalos (now [[Fatih Mosque, Trabzon|Fatih Mosque]]), the most impressive Byzantine building in the city.\n}}\nBy the time of [[Justinian]], the city served as an important base in his Persian Wars, and Miller notes that a portrait of the general [[Belisarius]] \"long adorned the church of St. Basil.\"<ref name=Miller-11>Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 11</ref> An inscription above the eastern gate of the city, commemorated the reconstruction of the civic walls following an earthquake at Justinian's expense.<ref name=Miller-11/> At some point before the 7th century the university (Pandidakterion) of the city was reestablished with a [[quadrivium]] curriculum.

However, the city gained great wealth from the taxes it levied on the goods traded between Persia and Europe via the Black Sea. The Mongol [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]] in 1258 diverted more trade caravans towards the city. Genoese and to a lesser extent Venetian traders regularly came to Trabzon. To secure their part of the Black Sea trade, the Genoese bought the coastal fortification \"Leonkastron\", just west of the winter harbour, in the year 1306.\n\nOne of the most famous persons to have visited the city in this period was [[Marco Polo]], who ended his overland return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown [[Venice]] with a ship; passing by [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261.

Especially [[Alexios II of Trebizond]] and his grandson [[Alexios III of Trebizond|Alexios III]] were patrons of the arts and sciences. After the great city fire of 1310, the ruined university was reestablished.

At that time the local aristocracy was engaged in the [[Trapezuntine Civil War]].

A few thousand [[Greek Muslims]] still live in the area, mostly in the \u00c7aykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon. Most are Sunni-Muslim, while there are some recent converts in the city{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and possibly a few [[Crypto-Christians]] in the Tonya/G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane area to the southwest of the city.

A number of European consulates were opened in the city due to its importance in regional trade and commerce. In the first half of the 19th century, Trabzon even became the main port for Persian exports. However, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] greatly diminished the international trading position of the city. In the last decades of the 19th century, the city saw some demographic changes. Many residents from the wider region (mostly Christians, but also some Jews and Greek or Turkish speaking Muslims) started to migrate to the Crimea and southern Ukraine, in search for farmland or employment in one of the booming cities along the northern and eastern coasts of the Black Sea. Among these migrants were the grandparents of [[Bob Dylan]] and Greek politicians and artists. At the same time, thousands of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus arrived in the city, especially after 1864, in what is known as the [[Circassian genocide]].\n\nNext to Constantinople, Smyrna and Selanik, Trabzon was one of the cities where western cultural and technological innovations were first introduced to the Ottoman Empire. In 1835, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] opened the Trebizond Mission station that it occupied from 1835 to 1859 and from 1882 to at least 1892.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rev.

While this number was low in comparison to other Ottoman provinces, its impact on the Armenian community in the city was large. Many prominent Armenian residents, among them scholars, musicians, photographers and painters, decided to migrate towards the Russian Empire or France.

Many adult Turkish males left the city out of fear for reprisals, even though governor Chrysantos included them in his administration. According to some sources the Russians banned Muslim [[mosque]]s, and forced [[Turkish people|Turks]], who were the largest ethnic group living in the city, to leave Trabzon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Grand Larousse encyclopedia'' Turkish edition, 22, page: 11669, ''Librairie Larousse''</ref>{{vn|date=June 2017}} However, already during the Russian occupation many Turks who had fled to surrounding villages started to return to the city, and governor Chrysantos helped them to re-establish their facilities such as schools, to the dismay of the Russians. During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] Russian soldiers in the city turned to rioting, with officers commandeering Trebizonian ships to flee the scene. The Russian Army ultimately retreated from the city and the rest of eastern and northeastern [[Anatolia]]. In December 1918 Trabzon deputy [[Haf\u0131z Mehmet]] gave a speech at the Turkish parliament in which he blamed the former governor of Trabzon province [[Cemal Azmi]] \u2013 who had fled to Germany after the Russian invasion \u2013 for orchestrating the Armenian Genocide in the city in 1915, by means of drowning. Subsequently, a series of war crimes trials were held in Trabzon in early 1919 (see [[Trabzon during the Armenian Genocide]]). Among others, Cemal Azmi was sentenced to death in absentia.\n\nDuring the [[Turkish War of Independence]] several Christian Pontic Greek communities in the Trebizond vilajet rebelled against the new army of [[Mustafa Kemal]] (notably in [[Bafra]] and [[Dumanl\u0131|Santa]]), but when nationalist Greeks came to Trabzon to proclaim revolution, they were not received with open arms by the local Pontic Greek population of the city. At the same time the Muslim population of the city, remembering their protection under Greek governor Crhysantos, protested the arrest of prominent Christians.

Trabzon's summers are warmer than oceanic classifications, but the narrow fluctuations in temperature render a significant influence from the sea. As with other major cities on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, Trabzon is situated right on the waterfront, thus allowing for the additional {{convert|1|-|2|C-change}} enough to surpass the threshold to be classified as subtropical. In comparison, only 1 or 2 percent of the province is classified as subtropical, the majority being [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''Cfb'') followed by [[humid continental climate]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''Dfb''), due to the immediate elevation increase starting from the coast, a typical characteristic of the Black Sea coast of Turkey. Trabzon's weather station also sees tendencies of a [[Mediterranean climate]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''Csa''), but with only one month below {{cvt|40|mm|in}} rainfall in summer it just fails to qualify.\n\nPrecipitation is heaviest in autumn and winter, with a marked reduction in the summer months, a [[microclimate|microclimatic]] condition of the city center compared to the rest of the region. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows.\n\nThe water temperature, like in the rest of the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is always cool and fluctuates between {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} throughout the year.\n\n{{Weather box \n|metric first= Yes \n|single line= Yes \n|location= Trabzon (1929\u20132017)\n|Jan record high C = 25.9\n|Feb record high C = 30.1\n|Mar record high C = 35.2\n|Apr record high C = 37.6\n|May record high C = 38.2\n|Jun record high C = 36.7\n|Jul record high C = 37.0\n|Aug record high C = 38.2\n|Sep record high C = 36.7\n|Oct record high C = 33.8\n|Nov record high C = 32.8\n|Dec record high C = 26.4\n|year record high C = 38.2\n|Jan high C = 10.7\n|Feb high C = 10.7\n|Mar high C = 11.8\n|Apr high C = 15.5\n|May high C = 19.1\n|Jun high C = 23.1\n|Jul high C= 25.8\n|Aug high C = 26.5\n|Sep high C = 23.6\n|Oct high C = 20.0\n|Nov high C = 16.4\n|Dec high C = 12.9\n|year high C = 18.0\n|Jan mean C = 7.3\n|Feb mean C = 7.2\n|Mar mean C = 8.3\n|Apr mean C = 11.7\n|May mean C = 15.9\n|Jun mean C = 20.3\n|Jul mean C = 23.1\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 20.3\n|Oct mean C = 16.6\n|Nov mean C = 12.8\n|Dec mean C = 9.5\n|year mean C = 14.7\n|Jan low C = 4.5\n|Feb low C = 4.3\n|Mar low C = 5.3\n|Apr low C = 8.6\n|May low C = 12.8\n|Jun low C = 16.9\n|Jul low C = 19.8\n|Aug low C = 20.3\n|Sep low C = 17.3\n|Oct low C = 13.6\n|Nov low C = 9.9\n|Dec low C = 6.6\n|year low C = 11.7\n|Jan record low C = -7.0\n|Feb record low C = -7.4\n|Mar record low C = -5.8\n|Apr record low C = -2.0\n|May record low C =  4.2\n|Jun record low C = 9.2\n|Jul record low C = 11.0\n|Aug record low C = 13.5\n|Sep record low C = 7.3\n|Oct record low C = 3.4\n|Nov record low C = -1.6\n|Dec record low C = -3.3\n|year record low C = -7.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 82.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 63.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 58.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 57.2\n|May precipitation mm = 51.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 50.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 35.5\n|Aug precipitation mm = 45.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 78.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 115.0\n|Nov precipitation mm = 99.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 83.3\n|year precipitation mm = 819.6\n|Jan precipitation days = 11.5\n|Feb precipitation days = 11.8\n|Mar precipitation days = 12.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 12.4\n|May precipitation days = 12.1\n|Jun precipitation days = 10.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 7.5\n|Aug precipitation days = 8.3\n|Sep precipitation days = 10.6\n|Oct precipitation days = 11.9\n|Nov precipitation days = 11.4\n|Dec precipitation days = 12.1\n|year precipitation days = 132.5\n|Jan humidity = 69\n|Feb humidity = 69\n|Mar humidity = 73\n|Apr humidity = 75\n|May humidity = 77\n|Jun humidity = 75\n|Jul humidity = 73\n|Aug humidity = 73\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 73\n|Nov humidity = 70\n|Dec humidity = 68\n\n|Jan sun = 83.7\n|Feb sun = 90.4\n|Mar sun = 105.4\n|Apr sun = 126.0\n|May sun = 170.5\n|Jun sun = 210.0\n|Jul sun = 182.9\n|Aug sun = 173.6\n|Sep sun = 147.0\n|Oct sun = 139.5\n|Nov sun = 108.0\n|Dec sun = 83.7\n\n|Jand sun = 2.7\n|Febd sun = 3.2\n|Mard sun = 3.4\n|Aprd sun = 4.2\n|Mayd sun = 5.5\n|Jund sun = 7.0\n|Juld sun = 5.9\n|Augd sun = 5.6\n|Sepd sun = 4.9\n|Octd sun = 4.5\n|Novd sun = 3.6\n|Decd sun = 2.7\n|yeard sun =\n|source 1 = [[Turkish State Meteorological Service]]<ref name = TSMS>{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190122033408/https://mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?k=A&m=TRABZON\n| archivedate = 22 January 2019\n| url = https://mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?k=A&m=TRABZON\n| title = Resmi \u0130statistikler: \u0130llerimize Ait Genel \u0130statistik Verileri\n| publisher = Turkish State Meteorological Service\n| language = Turkish\n| accessdate = 22 January 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2= Weatherbase<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=83071&refer=&units=us&cityname=Trabzon-Turkey|title=Trabzon, Turkey Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n|date=September 2016 }}\n\n==Economy==\nAs of 1920, the port at Trabzon was considered \"the most important of the Turkish Black Sea ports\" by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]].

In the city itself, one can find a hub of shops, stalls and restaurants surrounding the ''[[Meydan (park)|Meydan]]'', a square in the center of the city, which includes a tea garden.\n\n* The [[Hagia Sophia, Trabzon|Hagia Sophia]] ({{lang-tr|Ayasofya M\u00fczesi}}), a stunning Byzantine church, is probably the town's most important tourist attraction.\n* [[Trabzon Castle]] ruins are visible in the town but cannot be visited as they fall in a military zone.

In 1924 [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] stayed in the villa during his visit to Trabzon. He stayed there again in 1937. It houses period rooms and serves as a monument to the memory of the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey.\n* [[Boztepe hill, Trabzon|Boztepe Park]] is a small park and tea garden on the hills above Trabzon that has a panoramic view of nearly the entire city. The terrain in Trabzon is ascending in such a way that although the view is far above that of the buildings below, it is still close enough to be able to observe the flow of traffic and the people moving about in the city.\n* Uzun Sokak is one of the most crowded streets of Trabzon.\n* [[Trabzon Museum]] is located in the town centre and offers interesting exhibits on the history of the region, including an impressive collection of Byzantine artifacts.\n* Trabzon's Bazaar District offers interesting shopping opportunities on ancient narrow streets, continuing from Kundurac\u0131lar Street from the Meydan (town square).\n* [[Kostaki Mansion]] is located to the north of [[Zeytinlik, Artvin|Zeytinlik]] near Uzun Sokak.\n\nOther sites of the city include: [[Fatih Mosque of Trabzon|Fatih Mosque]] (originally the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church), [[Yeni Cuma Mosque]] (originally the Agios Eugenios Church), [[Nakip Mosque]] (originally the Agios Andreas Church), H\u00fcsn\u00fc K\u00f6ktu\u011f Mosque (originally the Agios Elevtherios Church), [[\u0130skender Pasha Mosque, Trabzon|\u0130skender Pasha Mosque]], Semerciler Mosque, \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Mosque, G\u00fclbahar Hatun Mosque and T\u00fcrbe (commissioned by Sultan [[Selim I]]), [[Kalepark]] (originally Leonkastron).\n\nWithin [[Trabzon Province]], the main attractions are the [[S\u00fcmela Monastery]] (i.&nbsp;e. the Monastery of the Panagia Soumel\u00e1) and the [[Uzung\u00f6l]] lake.

Many Trabzonites generally show a strong sense of loyalty to their family, friends, religion and country. Atat\u00fcrk selected his presidential guards from Trabzon and the neighbouring city of [[Giresun]] because of their fierce fighting ability and their loyalty.\n\nOutside of the relatively urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality and a willingness to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.\n\nThe people of the eastern Black Sea region are also known for their wit and sense of humour; many jokes in Turkey are told about the natives of the Black Sea region ''Karadeniz f\u0131kralar\u0131'' (Black Sea jokes). The character ''Temel'', a universal buffoon figure found in many cultures, forms an important part of the Turkish oral tradition.\n\nThe city's profile was raised somewhat in the English-speaking world by [[Rose Macaulay|Dame Rose Macaulay]]'s last novel, ''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]'' (1956), which is still in print.<ref>[[Rose Macaulay|Macaulay, Rose]]: ''The Towers of Trebizond'' (Collins, London, 1956)</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Ktu foto 1.jpg|thumb|A view from the [[Karadeniz Technical University|Black Sea Technical University]] campus]]\n\n[[Karadeniz Technical University|Black Sea Technical University]] in Trabzon hosts students from all over Turkey, especially from the [[Black Sea Region|Black Sea]] and [[East Anatolia Region, Turkey|East Anatolian]] regions, as well as students from the [[Turkic states]] in [[Central Asia]].\n\nHistorically the city was a center of Greek culture and education and from 1683 to 1921, a teachers' college operated known as [[Phrontisterion of Trapezous]], which provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region.<ref>{{cite book | last= \u00d6zdalga|first=Elisabeth | title= Late Ottoman society: the intellectual legacy | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sRtTyyGIgXsC&pg=PA261 | isbn= 978-0-415-34164-6| page =261}}</ref> The building of this institution (built in 1902) still remains the most impressive [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] monument in the city and today hosts the Turkish school ''Anadolu Lisesi''.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Bryer |first1=Anthony  |last2=Winfield|first2=David | title= The post-Byzantine monuments of Pontos | publisher=Ashgate | year=2006 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gmfqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Trebizond%2Bgreek%2Bphrontisterion&q=phrontisterion#search_anchor | isbn= 978-0-86078-864-5| page =xxxiii}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\nTrabzon's regional cuisine is traditionally reliant on fish, especially ''hamsi'' (fresh [[European Anchovy]] similar to the British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the ''[[Ak\u00e7aabat]] [[k\u00f6fte]]'' (spicy lamb meatball from the Ak\u00e7aabat district), ''Karadeniz pidesi'' (canoe shaped [[pita]] bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), ''kuymak'' (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), ''Vakf\u0131kebir ekme\u011fi'' (large country-style bread), ''Tonya tereya\u011f\u0131'' (Tonya butter), ''tava m\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi'' (deep-dish corn bread) and ''kara lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131'' (bean and cabbage soup). ''Taflan kavurmas\u0131'' is a [[Prunus laurocerasus|cherry laurel]] dish served with onions and [[olive oil]]. Trabzon is also famous for its [[hazelnut]]s. The [[Black Sea region]] of Turkey is the world's largest producer of [[cherry]] and [[hazelnut]]; and a large production area of [[tea]]; all of which play an important role in the local cuisine.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Trabzonspor trophy museum.jpg|thumb|Trophies won by [[Trabzonspor]] at the club's museum.]]\n\n[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in Trabzon. The city's top sports club, [[Trabzonspor]], was until [[2009\u201310 S\u00fcper Lig|2010]] the only Turkish football club outside \u0130stanbul to win the [[S\u00fcper Lig]] (six times), which was previously (until Trabzonspor's first championship title in the [[1975\u201376 1.Lig|1975\u201376 season]]) won only by the \"Big Three\" clubs of [[Istanbul]], namely [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], [[Fenerbah\u00e7e SK|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] and [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]]. Due to Trabzonspor's success, the decades-old term \"Big Three\" which defined the most successful football clubs in Turkey had to be modified into the \"Big Four\". \nTrabzonspor is also one of the most successful Turkish clubs in the [[UEFA|European Cups]], managing to beat numerous prominent teams such as [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Olympique Lyonnais]].

Others included [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]] and [[Cyzicus]] in the [[Dardanelles]], and nearby [[Giresun|Kerasous]]. Like most [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] colonies, the city was a small enclave of Greek life, and not an empire unto its own, in the later European sense of the word. As a colony Trapezous initially paid tribute to Sinope, but early banking (money-changing) activity is suggested occurring in the city already in the 4th century BCE, according to a silver [[drachma]] coin from Trapezus in the [[British Museum]], London. [[Cyrus the Great]] added the city to the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and was possibly the first ruler to consolidate the eastern Black Sea region into a single political entity (a [[satrapy]]).\n\n[[File:The Return of the Ten Thousand under Xenophon.jpg|thumb|left|Th\u00e1latta! Th\u00e1latta! (\"The Sea! The Sea!\").<br> Trebizond was the first Greek city the [[Ten Thousand]] reached on their retreat from Persia. 19th c. illustration by Herman Vogel.]]\nTrebizond's trade partners included the [[Mossynoeci]]. When [[Xenophon]] and the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]] mercenaries were fighting their way out of [[Persia]], the first Greek city they reached was Trebizond (Xenophon, ''Anabasis'', 5.5.10). The city and the local Mossynoeci had become estranged from the Mossynoecian capital, to the point of civil war. Xenophon's force resolved this in the rebels' favor, and so in Trebizond's interest.\n\nUp until the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] the city remained under the dominion of the Achaemenids. While the Pontus was not directly affected by the war, its cities gained independence as a result of it. Local ruling families continued to claim partial Persian heritage, and Persian culture had some lasting influence on the city; the holy springs of mt. Minthrion to the east of the old town were devoted to the Persian-Anatolian Greek god [[Mithra]]. In the 2nd century BCE the city with its natural harbours was added to the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] by [[Pharnaces I of Pontus|Pharnaces I]]. [[Mithridates VI Eupator]] made it the home port of the Pontic fleet, in his quest to remove the Romans from Anatolia.\n\nAfter the defeat of Mithridates in 66 BCE the city was first handed to the Galatians, but it was soon returned to the grandson of Mithradates, and subsequently became part of the new client Kingdom of Pontus. When the kingdom was finally annexed to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Galatia]] two centuries later, the fleet passed to new commanders, becoming the ''[[Roman Navy#Classis Pontica|Classis Pontica]]''. The city received the status of [[Free city (classical antiquity)|civitas libera]], extending it judicial autonomy and the right to mint its own coin. Trabzon gained importance for its access to roads leading over the [[Zigana Pass]] to the [[Armenia]]n frontier or the upper [[Euphrates]] valley. New roads were constructed from [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] under the rule of [[Vespasian]]. In the next century, the emperor [[Hadrian]] commissioned improvements to give the city a more structured harbor.<ref name=Miller-9>[[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]], ''Trebizond: The Last Greek Empire'', 1926, (Chicago: Argonaut Publishers, 1968), p. 9</ref> The emperor visited the city in the year 129 as part of his inspection of the eastern border ([[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]).

Only in the reign of [[Diocletian]] appears an inscription alluding to the restoration of the city; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] could only write of Trebizond that it was \"not an obscure town.\" [[Christianity]] had reached Trebizond by the third century, for during the reign of Diocletian occurred the martyrdom of [[Eugenius of Trebizond|Eugenius]] and his associates Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila.<ref>Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 10</ref> Eugenius had destroyed the statue of [[Mithras]] which overlooked the city from [[Mount Minthrion]] (Boztepe), and became the patron saint of the city after his death. Early Christians sought refuge in the Pontic Mountains south of the city, where they established [[Vazelon Monastery]] in 270 AD and [[Sumela Monastery]] in 386 AD. As early as the [[First Council of Nicea]], Trebizond had its own bishop.<ref name=\"Hewsen46\">Hewsen, 46</ref> Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the [[Metropolitan Bishop]] of [[Poti]].<ref name=\"Hewsen46\" /> Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of [[Lazica]].<ref name=\"Hewsen46\" />\n\n===Byzantine period===\n{{Main|Chaldia}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width1 = 220\n | width2 = 220\n | image1 = Hagia Anna Trabzon.JPG\n | caption1 = [[Saint Anne Church, Trabzon|Saint Anne Church]] to the east of the walled city is the oldest church in the city, possibly dating back to the 6th or 7th century.\n | image2 = Trabzon,Ortahisar1.jpg\n | caption2 = The 10th-century cathedral Panaghia Chrysokephalos (now [[Fatih Mosque, Trabzon|Fatih Mosque]]), the most impressive Byzantine building in the city.\n}}\nBy the time of [[Justinian]], the city served as an important base in his Persian Wars, and Miller notes that a portrait of the general [[Belisarius]] \"long adorned the church of St. Basil.\"<ref name=Miller-11>Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 11</ref> An inscription above the eastern gate of the city, commemorated the reconstruction of the civic walls following an earthquake at Justinian's expense.<ref name=Miller-11/> At some point before the 7th century the university (Pandidakterion) of the city was reestablished with a [[quadrivium]] curriculum.

Byzantine authors, such as [[George Pachymeres|Pachymeres]], and to some extent Trapezundines such as [[John Lazaropoulos|Lazaropoulos]] and [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], regarded the Trebizond Empire as being no more than a [[Lazica|Lazian]] border state.

However, the city gained great wealth from the taxes it levied on the goods traded between Persia and Europe via the Black Sea. The Mongol [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]] in 1258 diverted more trade caravans towards the city. Genoese and to a lesser extent Venetian traders regularly came to Trabzon. To secure their part of the Black Sea trade, the Genoese bought the coastal fortification \"Leonkastron\", just west of the winter harbour, in the year 1306.\n\nOne of the most famous persons to have visited the city in this period was [[Marco Polo]], who ended his overland return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown [[Venice]] with a ship; passing by [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261. A year earlier, in 1260, [[Niccol\u00f2 and Maffeo Polo]] (the father and uncle of Marco Polo) were residing in Constantinople, then the capital of the [[Latin Empire]]. They foresaw a political change, liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away.<ref name=\"Britannica571\">{{Harvnb|Britannica|2002|p=571}}</ref> Their decision proved wise, as Constantinople was recaptured in 1261 by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], the ruler of the [[Empire of Nicaea]], who promptly burned the Venetian quarter in the city and reestablished the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Trebizond played a mythical role in European literature of the late middle-ages and the Renaissance. [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]] gave their protagonists the desire to possess the city.<ref>'The lure of Trebizond' by Anthony Eastmond, in ''Byzantium's Other Empire: Trebizond'', p. 22, 2016, Istanbul</ref> Next to literature, the legendary history of the city \u2013 and that of the Pontus in general \u2013 also influenced the creation of [[paintings]], [[Play (theatre)|theatre plays]] and [[operas]] in Western Europe throughout the following centuries.\n\nThe city also played a role in the early [[Renaissance]]; The western takeover of Constantinople, which formalized Trebizond's political independence, also led Byzantine intellectuals to seek refuge in the city. Especially [[Alexios II of Trebizond]] and his grandson [[Alexios III of Trebizond|Alexios III]] were patrons of the arts and sciences. After the great city fire of 1310, the ruined university was reestablished. As part of the university [[Gregory Choniades]] opened a new academy of astronomy, which housed the best observatory outside Persia. Choniades brought with him the works of Shams al-Din al-Bukhari,<ref>[http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Shams_al-Din_al-Bukhari_BEA.htm \"Shams al\u2010D\u012bn al\u2010Bukh\u0101r\u012b\"].

At that time the local aristocracy was engaged in the [[Trapezuntine Civil War]]. Constantinople remained the Byzantine capital until it was [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1453, who also [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|conquered Trebizond]] eight years later, in 1461.\n\nIts demographic legacy endured for several centuries after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, as a substantial number of [[Greek Orthodox]] inhabitants, usually referred to as [[Pontic Greeks]], continued to live in the area during Ottoman rule, up until 1923, when they were deported to Greece. A few thousand [[Greek Muslims]] still live in the area, mostly in the \u00c7aykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon.

A number of European consulates were opened in the city due to its importance in regional trade and commerce. In the first half of the 19th century, Trabzon even became the main port for Persian exports. However, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] greatly diminished the international trading position of the city. In the last decades of the 19th century, the city saw some demographic changes. Many residents from the wider region (mostly Christians, but also some Jews and Greek or Turkish speaking Muslims) started to migrate to the Crimea and southern Ukraine, in search for farmland or employment in one of the booming cities along the northern and eastern coasts of the Black Sea. Among these migrants were the grandparents of [[Bob Dylan]] and Greek politicians and artists. At the same time, thousands of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus arrived in the city, especially after 1864, in what is known as the [[Circassian genocide]].\n\nNext to Constantinople, Smyrna and Selanik, Trabzon was one of the cities where western cultural and technological innovations were first introduced to the Ottoman Empire.

In 1912 the S\u00fcmer Opera House was opened on the central Meydan square, being one of the first in the empire. The city lost many young male citizens at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] in the winter of 1914\u201315.  The coastal region between the city and the Russian frontier was the site of key battles between the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] armies during the [[Trebizond Campaign]], part of the [[Caucasus Campaign]] of World War I. A bombardment of the city in 1915 by the Russian navy cost the lives of 1300 citizens.<ref>Daniel Maldonado in 'Historic Cities of the Islamic World', 2007, p. 525, C. Edmund Bosworth (ed)</ref>\n\nIn July 1915, most of the adult male Armenians of the city were marched off south in five convoys, towards the mines of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, never to be seen again. Other victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]] were reportedly taken out to sea in boats which were then capsized.<ref>''Toronto Globe'', August 26, 1915.</ref><ref>''Takvimi Vekdyi'', No. 3616, August 6, 1919, p. 2.</ref>\n\nThe Russian army landed at [[Pazar, Rize|Atina]], east of Rize on March 4, 1916. [[Lazistan Sanjak]] fell within two days. However, due to heavy guerrilla resistance around Of and \u00c7aykara some 50&nbsp;km to the east of Trabzon, it took a further 40 days for the Russian army to advance west.<ref>Infographic by the newspaper ''[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]]'' showing the advance of the Russian front on Trebizond, The Sphere, April 29, 1916</ref> The Ottoman administration of Trabzon foresaw the fall of the city and called for a meeting with community leaders, where they handed control of the city to Greek metropolitan bishop [[Archbishop Chrysanthus of Athens|Chrysantos Philippidis]]. Chrysantos promised to protect the Muslim population of the city. Ottoman forces retreated from Trabzon, and on April 15 the city was taken without a fight by the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] under command of [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich|Nikolai Yudenich]]. Many adult Turkish males left the city out of fear for reprisals, even though governor Chrysantos included them in his administration. According to some sources the Russians banned Muslim [[mosque]]s, and forced [[Turkish people|Turks]], who were the largest ethnic group living in the city, to leave Trabzon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Grand Larousse encyclopedia'' Turkish edition, 22, page: 11669, ''Librairie Larousse''</ref>{{vn|date=June 2017}} However, already during the Russian occupation many Turks who had fled to surrounding villages started to return to the city, and governor Chrysantos helped them to re-establish their facilities such as schools, to the dismay of the Russians. During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] Russian soldiers in the city turned to rioting, with officers commandeering Trebizonian ships to flee the scene. The Russian Army ultimately retreated from the city and the rest of eastern and northeastern [[Anatolia]]. In December 1918 Trabzon deputy [[Haf\u0131z Mehmet]] gave a speech at the Turkish parliament in which he blamed the former governor of Trabzon province [[Cemal Azmi]] \u2013 who had fled to Germany after the Russian invasion \u2013 for orchestrating the Armenian Genocide in the city in 1915, by means of drowning. Subsequently, a series of war crimes trials were held in Trabzon in early 1919 (see [[Trabzon during the Armenian Genocide]]). Among others, Cemal Azmi was sentenced to death in absentia.\n\nDuring the [[Turkish War of Independence]] several Christian Pontic Greek communities in the Trebizond vilajet rebelled against the new army of [[Mustafa Kemal]] (notably in [[Bafra]] and [[Dumanl\u0131|Santa]]), but when nationalist Greeks came to Trabzon to proclaim revolution, they were not received with open arms by the local Pontic Greek population of the city. At the same time the Muslim population of the city, remembering their protection under Greek governor Crhysantos, protested the arrest of prominent Christians. Liberal delegates of Trabzon opposed the election of Mustafa Kemal as the leader of the Turkish revolution at the [[Erzurum Congress]]. The governor and mayor of Trabzon were appalled by the violence against Ottoman Greek subjects,<ref>[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sjHxXvkEGiIJ:https://www.thenationalherald.com/176214/seattle-city-council-asia-minor Seattle City Council and Asia Minor \u2013 The articles of Herbert Adams Gibbons in the Christian Science Monitor] Stavros T.

The efforts of the pro-Ottoman, anti-nationalist population of Trabzon only postponed the inevitable, because the national governments of Turkey and Greece agreed to a mutual [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|forced population exchange]]. This exchange included well over one hundred thousand Greeks from Trabzon and the vicinity, to the relatively new [[Greece|Greek state]].<ref>Baum, Wilhelm (2006). ''The Christian minorities in Turkey''. Kitab. p. 162. {{ISBN|978-3-902005-62-5}}. \"On October 11, 1922, Turkey concluded an armistice with the allied forces, but not with the Greeks. The Greeks in the other settlement areas of Asia Minor were also expelled at that time, like e.g. the Kappadocian Greeks in the Goreme area and the other Greeks in Pontus, in the Trabzon area and on the west coast.\"</ref> During the war Trabzon parliamentarian [[Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey]] was one of the leading figures of the [[Second Group (Turkey)|first Turkish opposition party]]. Through his newspaper ''Tan'', \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc and his colleagues publicized their critiques of the Kemalist government, such as its violence towards Greeks during the population exchange.\n[[File:Uzun Sokak at night.JPG|thumb|left|Uzun Sokak, a pedestrianized shopping street.]]\n\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 137\n | width2 = 150\n | image1 = Chrysanthos.jpg\n | caption1 = Chrysanthos Philippidis, metropolitan and governor of Trabzon during part of the First World War.

Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey, who had studied in the [[United Kingdom]], is seen as a hero by the people of Trabzon, while in neighboring Giresun there is a statue of his murderer Topal Osman.\n\nDuring World War II shipping activity was limited because the Black Sea had again become a war zone. Hence, the most important export products, [[tobacco]] and [[hazelnut]], could not be sold and living standards degraded.\n\nAs a result of the general development of the country, Trabzon has developed its economic and commercial life. The coastal highway and a new harbour have increased commercial relations with central Anatolia, which has led to some growth. However, progress has been slow in comparison to the western and the southwestern parts of Turkey.\n\nTrabzon is famous throughout Turkey for its [[anchovies]] called ''hamsi'', which are the main meal in many restaurants in the city. Major exports from Trabzon include [[hazelnuts]] and [[tea]].\n\nThe city still has a sizable community of [[Greek Muslims#Greek Muslims of Pontus|Greek-speaking Muslims]], most of whom are originally from the vicinities of [[Tonya, Turkey|Tonya]], [[S\u00fcrmene]] and [[\u00c7aykara]].

The total area is 22.4% plateau and 77.6% hills. The [[Pontic Mountains]] pass through the Trabzon Province.\n\nTrabzon used to be an important [[pilotage|reference point]] for [[navigation|navigators]] in the Black Sea during harsh weather conditions.

Winters are cool and damp, and the lowest average minimum temperature is around {{convert|5|\u00b0C}} in January. Trabzon's summers are warmer than oceanic classifications, but the narrow fluctuations in temperature render a significant influence from the sea. As with other major cities on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, Trabzon is situated right on the waterfront, thus allowing for the additional {{convert|1|-|2|C-change}} enough to surpass the threshold to be classified as subtropical. In comparison, only 1 or 2 percent of the province is classified as subtropical, the majority being [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''Cfb'') followed by [[humid continental climate]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''Dfb''), due to the immediate elevation increase starting from the coast, a typical characteristic of the Black Sea coast of Turkey. Trabzon's weather station also sees tendencies of a [[Mediterranean climate]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''Csa''), but with only one month below {{cvt|40|mm|in}} rainfall in summer it just fails to qualify.\n\nPrecipitation is heaviest in autumn and winter, with a marked reduction in the summer months, a [[microclimate|microclimatic]] condition of the city center compared to the rest of the region. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows.\n\nThe water temperature, like in the rest of the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is always cool and fluctuates between {{convert|8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} throughout the year.\n\n{{Weather box \n|metric first= Yes \n|single line= Yes \n|location= Trabzon (1929\u20132017)\n|Jan record high C = 25.9\n|Feb record high C = 30.1\n|Mar record high C = 35.2\n|Apr record high C = 37.6\n|May record high C = 38.2\n|Jun record high C = 36.7\n|Jul record high C = 37.0\n|Aug record high C = 38.2\n|Sep record high C = 36.7\n|Oct record high C = 33.8\n|Nov record high C = 32.8\n|Dec record high C = 26.4\n|year record high C = 38.2\n|Jan high C = 10.7\n|Feb high C = 10.7\n|Mar high C = 11.8\n|Apr high C = 15.5\n|May high C = 19.1\n|Jun high C = 23.1\n|Jul high C= 25.8\n|Aug high C = 26.5\n|Sep high C = 23.6\n|Oct high C = 20.0\n|Nov high C = 16.4\n|Dec high C = 12.9\n|year high C = 18.0\n|Jan mean C = 7.3\n|Feb mean C = 7.2\n|Mar mean C = 8.3\n|Apr mean C = 11.7\n|May mean C = 15.9\n|Jun mean C = 20.3\n|Jul mean C = 23.1\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 20.3\n|Oct mean C = 16.6\n|Nov mean C = 12.8\n|Dec mean C = 9.5\n|year mean C = 14.7\n|Jan low C = 4.5\n|Feb low C = 4.3\n|Mar low C = 5.3\n|Apr low C = 8.6\n|May low C = 12.8\n|Jun low C = 16.9\n|Jul low C = 19.8\n|Aug low C = 20.3\n|Sep low C = 17.3\n|Oct low C = 13.6\n|Nov low C = 9.9\n|Dec low C = 6.6\n|year low C = 11.7\n|Jan record low C = -7.0\n|Feb record low C = -7.4\n|Mar record low C = -5.8\n|Apr record low C = -2.0\n|May record low C =  4.2\n|Jun record low C = 9.2\n|Jul record low C = 11.0\n|Aug record low C = 13.5\n|Sep record low C = 7.3\n|Oct record low C = 3.4\n|Nov record low C = -1.6\n|Dec record low C = -3.3\n|year record low C = -7.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 82.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 63.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 58.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 57.2\n|May precipitation mm = 51.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 50.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 35.5\n|Aug precipitation mm = 45.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 78.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 115.0\n|Nov precipitation mm = 99.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 83.3\n|year precipitation mm = 819.6\n|Jan precipitation days = 11.5\n|Feb precipitation days = 11.8\n|Mar precipitation days = 12.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 12.4\n|May precipitation days = 12.1\n|Jun precipitation days = 10.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 7.5\n|Aug precipitation days = 8.3\n|Sep precipitation days = 10.6\n|Oct precipitation days = 11.9\n|Nov precipitation days = 11.4\n|Dec precipitation days = 12.1\n|year precipitation days = 132.5\n|Jan humidity = 69\n|Feb humidity = 69\n|Mar humidity = 73\n|Apr humidity = 75\n|May humidity = 77\n|Jun humidity = 75\n|Jul humidity = 73\n|Aug humidity = 73\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 73\n|Nov humidity = 70\n|Dec humidity = 68\n\n|Jan sun = 83.7\n|Feb sun = 90.4\n|Mar sun = 105.4\n|Apr sun = 126.0\n|May sun = 170.5\n|Jun sun = 210.0\n|Jul sun = 182.9\n|Aug sun = 173.6\n|Sep sun = 147.0\n|Oct sun = 139.5\n|Nov sun = 108.0\n|Dec sun = 83.7\n\n|Jand sun = 2.7\n|Febd sun = 3.2\n|Mard sun = 3.4\n|Aprd sun = 4.2\n|Mayd sun = 5.5\n|Jund sun = 7.0\n|Juld sun = 5.9\n|Augd sun = 5.6\n|Sepd sun = 4.9\n|Octd sun = 4.5\n|Novd sun = 3.6\n|Decd sun = 2.7\n|yeard sun =\n|source 1 = [[Turkish State Meteorological Service]]<ref name = TSMS>{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190122033408/https://mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?k=A&m=TRABZON\n| archivedate = 22 January 2019\n| url = https://mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?k=A&m=TRABZON\n| title = Resmi \u0130statistikler: \u0130llerimize Ait Genel \u0130statistik Verileri\n| publisher = Turkish State Meteorological Service\n| language = Turkish\n| accessdate = 22 January 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2= Weatherbase<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=83071&refer=&units=us&cityname=Trabzon-Turkey|title=Trabzon, Turkey Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n|date=September 2016 }}\n\n==Economy==\nAs of 1920, the port at Trabzon was considered \"the most important of the Turkish Black Sea ports\" by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]].

In the city itself, one can find a hub of shops, stalls and restaurants surrounding the ''[[Meydan (park)|Meydan]]'', a square in the center of the city, which includes a tea garden.\n\n* The [[Hagia Sophia, Trabzon|Hagia Sophia]] ({{lang-tr|Ayasofya M\u00fczesi}}), a stunning Byzantine church, is probably the town's most important tourist attraction.\n* [[Trabzon Castle]] ruins are visible in the town but cannot be visited as they fall in a military zone.  The outside wall of the castle now serves as the back wall of a military building.\n* The \"Atat\u00fcrk K\u00f6\u015fk\u00fc\" is a villa built in 1890 by a local Greek merchant. In 1924 [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] stayed in the villa during his visit to Trabzon. He stayed there again in 1937. It houses period rooms and serves as a monument to the memory of the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey.\n* [[Boztepe hill, Trabzon|Boztepe Park]] is a small park and tea garden on the hills above Trabzon that has a panoramic view of nearly the entire city. The terrain in Trabzon is ascending in such a way that although the view is far above that of the buildings below, it is still close enough to be able to observe the flow of traffic and the people moving about in the city.\n* Uzun Sokak is one of the most crowded streets of Trabzon.\n* [[Trabzon Museum]] is located in the town centre and offers interesting exhibits on the history of the region, including an impressive collection of Byzantine artifacts.\n* Trabzon's Bazaar District offers interesting shopping opportunities on ancient narrow streets, continuing from Kundurac\u0131lar Street from the Meydan (town square).\n* [[Kostaki Mansion]] is located to the north of [[Zeytinlik, Artvin|Zeytinlik]] near Uzun Sokak.\n\nOther sites of the city include: [[Fatih Mosque of Trabzon|Fatih Mosque]] (originally the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church), [[Yeni Cuma Mosque]] (originally the Agios Eugenios Church), [[Nakip Mosque]] (originally the Agios Andreas Church), H\u00fcsn\u00fc K\u00f6ktu\u011f Mosque (originally the Agios Elevtherios Church), [[\u0130skender Pasha Mosque, Trabzon|\u0130skender Pasha Mosque]], Semerciler Mosque, \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Mosque, G\u00fclbahar Hatun Mosque and T\u00fcrbe (commissioned by Sultan [[Selim I]]), [[Kalepark]] (originally Leonkastron).\n\nWithin [[Trabzon Province]], the main attractions are the [[S\u00fcmela Monastery]] (i.&nbsp;e. the Monastery of the Panagia Soumel\u00e1) and the [[Uzung\u00f6l]] lake. The monastery is built on the side of a very steep mountain overlooking the green forests below and is about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the city. Uzung\u00f6l is known for its natural environment and scenery.

Many Trabzonites generally show a strong sense of loyalty to their family, friends, religion and country. Atat\u00fcrk selected his presidential guards from Trabzon and the neighbouring city of [[Giresun]] because of their fierce fighting ability and their loyalty.\n\nOutside of the relatively urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality and a willingness to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.\n\nThe people of the eastern Black Sea region are also known for their wit and sense of humour; many jokes in Turkey are told about the natives of the Black Sea region ''Karadeniz f\u0131kralar\u0131'' (Black Sea jokes). The character ''Temel'', a universal buffoon figure found in many cultures, forms an important part of the Turkish oral tradition.\n\nThe city's profile was raised somewhat in the English-speaking world by [[Rose Macaulay|Dame Rose Macaulay]]'s last novel, ''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]'' (1956), which is still in print.<ref>[[Rose Macaulay|Macaulay, Rose]]: ''The Towers of Trebizond'' (Collins, London, 1956)</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Ktu foto 1.jpg|thumb|A view from the [[Karadeniz Technical University|Black Sea Technical University]] campus]]\n\n[[Karadeniz Technical University|Black Sea Technical University]] in Trabzon hosts students from all over Turkey, especially from the [[Black Sea Region|Black Sea]] and [[East Anatolia Region, Turkey|East Anatolian]] regions, as well as students from the [[Turkic states]] in [[Central Asia]].\n\nHistorically the city was a center of Greek culture and education and from 1683 to 1921, a teachers' college operated known as [[Phrontisterion of Trapezous]], which provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region.<ref>{{cite book | last= \u00d6zdalga|first=Elisabeth | title= Late Ottoman society: the intellectual legacy | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sRtTyyGIgXsC&pg=PA261 | isbn= 978-0-415-34164-6| page =261}}</ref> The building of this institution (built in 1902) still remains the most impressive [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] monument in the city and today hosts the Turkish school ''Anadolu Lisesi''.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Bryer |first1=Anthony  |last2=Winfield|first2=David | title= The post-Byzantine monuments of Pontos | publisher=Ashgate | year=2006 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gmfqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Trebizond%2Bgreek%2Bphrontisterion&q=phrontisterion#search_anchor | isbn= 978-0-86078-864-5| page =xxxiii}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\nTrabzon's regional cuisine is traditionally reliant on fish, especially ''hamsi'' (fresh [[European Anchovy]] similar to the British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the ''[[Ak\u00e7aabat]] [[k\u00f6fte]]'' (spicy lamb meatball from the Ak\u00e7aabat district), ''Karadeniz pidesi'' (canoe shaped [[pita]] bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), ''kuymak'' (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), ''Vakf\u0131kebir ekme\u011fi'' (large country-style bread), ''Tonya tereya\u011f\u0131'' (Tonya butter), ''tava m\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi'' (deep-dish corn bread) and ''kara lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131'' (bean and cabbage soup). ''Taflan kavurmas\u0131'' is a [[Prunus laurocerasus|cherry laurel]] dish served with onions and [[olive oil]]. Trabzon is also famous for its [[hazelnut]]s. The [[Black Sea region]] of Turkey is the world's largest producer of [[cherry]] and [[hazelnut]]; and a large production area of [[tea]]; all of which play an important role in the local cuisine.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Trabzonspor trophy museum.jpg|thumb|Trophies won by [[Trabzonspor]] at the club's museum.]]\n\n[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in Trabzon. The city's top sports club, [[Trabzonspor]], was until [[2009\u201310 S\u00fcper Lig|2010]] the only Turkish football club outside \u0130stanbul to win the [[S\u00fcper Lig]] (six times), which was previously (until Trabzonspor's first championship title in the [[1975\u201376 1.Lig|1975\u201376 season]]) won only by the \"Big Three\" clubs of [[Istanbul]], namely [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], [[Fenerbah\u00e7e SK|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] and [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]]. Due to Trabzonspor's success, the decades-old term \"Big Three\" which defined the most successful football clubs in Turkey had to be modified into the \"Big Four\". \nTrabzonspor is also one of the most successful Turkish clubs in the [[UEFA|European Cups]], managing to beat numerous prominent teams such as [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Olympique Lyonnais]]. Renowned former players of Trabzonspor include [[\u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f]], [[Lars Olsen]] and [[Shota Arveladze]].\n\nTrabzon hosted the [[2007 Black Sea Games|First Edition]] of the [[Black Sea Games]] in July 2007 and the [[2011 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{main|Category:People from Trabzon}}\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey}}\n\n===Twin towns - sister cities===\nTrabzon is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Karde\u015f \u015eehirler|url=https://www.trabzon.bel.tr/fck-sayfalar.aspx?id=4485|website=trabzon.bel.tr|publisher=Trabzon|language=tr|accessdate=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|GEO}} [[Batumi]], Georgia, since 2000\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Dortmund]], Germany, since 2013\n*{{flagicon|KGZ}} [[Bishkek]], Kyrgyzstan, since 2014\n*{{flagicon|TUN}} [[Gab\u00e8s]], Tunisia, since 2013\n*{{flagicon|IRN}} [[Rasht]], Iran, since 2000\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Rizhao]], China, since 1997\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Sochi]], Russia, since 1993\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Szigetv\u00e1r]], Hungary, since 1998\n<!--Travnik - not twinning-->\n*{{flagicon|IRN}} [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]], Iran, since 2001\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amasya]] (ancient [[Amaseia]], capital of the Pontic Greeks during classical antiquity)\n* [[Anatolian Tigers]]\n* [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea Region]]\n* [[Kemen\u00e7e of the Black Sea]]\n* [[Kolbast\u0131]]\n* [[World Trade Center Trabzon]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'' eds.

According to an August 2018 [[Qualtrics]] poll for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 58% of Floridians are familiar enough with QAnon to have an opinion about it. Among those who did have an opinion, most were unfavorable toward the QAnon movement. The average score on the feeling thermometer was just above 20. This is a very negative rating, and about half of what [\u2026] other political figures [\u2026] enjoy. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/30/the-qanon-conspiracy-movement-is-very-unpopular-our-new-poll-finds/|title=Analysis &#124; New poll: the QAnon conspiracy movement is very unpopular|first1=Joseph|last1=Uscinski|first2=Casey|last2=Klofstad|website=Washington Post}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/30/the-qanon-conspiracy-movement-is-very-unpopular-our-new-poll-finds/|title=New poll: the QAnon conspiracy movement is very unpopular|last=Uscinski|first=Joseph|last2=Klofstad|first2=Casey|date=August 30, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref> Positive feelings toward QAnon were found to be strongly correlated with one's proneness to conspiracy thinking.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nExperts have classified the appeal of QAnon as similar to that of religious cults. According to expert in online conspiracy Renee DiResta, the QAnon pattern is similar to enticement into cults in the pre-Internet era, where as the targeted person was led deeper and deeper into the group's secrets, they become more and more isolated from friends and family outside of the cult.<ref name=\":11\" /> In the Internet age, QAnon virtual communities have little \"real world\" connection with each other, but online, they can number in the tens of thousands.<ref name=\":11\" /> Rachel Bernstein, an expert on cults who specializes in recovery therapy, says that \"What a movement such as QAnon has going for it, and why it will catch on like wildfire, is that it makes people feel connected to something important that other people don't yet know about. ... All cults will provide this feeling of being special.\" There is no self-correction process within the group, since the self-reinforcing true believers are immune to correction, fact-checking, or counter-speech, which is drowned out in the [[groupthink]] of the cult.<ref name=\":11\">Diresta, Renee (November 13, 2018) [https://www.wired.com/story/online-conspiracy-groups-qanon-cults/ \"Online Conspiracy Groups Are a Lot Like Cults\"] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''</ref>\n\nQAnon is an example of what historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] called in 1954 \"[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]\", in which history and political trends are seen in apocalyptic terms: <blockquote>The paranoid spokesman ... traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point. Like [[millennialism|religious millennialists]] he expresses the anxiety of those who are living through the last days and he is sometimes disposed to set a date for the apocalypse... Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, what is necessary is not compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Since the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable, he must be totally eliminated &ndash; if not from the world, at least from the theatre of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention.<ref name=salon0819 /></blockquote>\n\nTravis View, a researcher who studies QAnon, says of it that it is as addictive as a video game, and offers the \"player\" the appealing possibility of being involved in something of world-historical importance. According to View, \"You can sit at your computer and search for information and then post about what you find, and Q basically promises that through this process, you are going to radically change the country, institute this incredible, almost bloodless revolution, and then be part of this historical movement that will be written about for generations.\" View compares this to mundane political involvement in which one's efforts might help to get a state legislator elected. QAnon, says View, competes not in the marketplace of ideas, but in the marketplace of realities.<ref>Rosenberg, Alyssa (August 7, 2019) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/07/qanon-isnt-just-conspiracy-theory-its-highly-effective-game/ \"I understand the temptation to dismiss QAnon. Here\u2019s why we can\u2019t.\"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref>\n\nNonetheless, some QAnon believers have eventually started to realize that they have been isolated from family and loved ones, and suffer loneliness because of it. For some, this is a pathway to slowly beginning the process of divesting themselves of their cultish beliefs, while for others, the isolation reinforces the benefits they get from belonging to the cult. View says that,\n<blockquote>People in the QAnon community often talk about alienation from family and friends. ... Though they typically talk about how Q frayed their relationships on private Facebook groups. But they think these issues are temporary and primarily the fault of others. They often comfort themselves by imagining that there will be a moment of vindication sometime in the near future which will prove their beliefs right. They imagine that after this happens, not only will their relationships be restored, but people will turn to them as leaders who understand what's going on better than the rest of us.<ref name=beast>Weill, Kelly (December 22, 2018) [https://www.thedailybeast.com/christmas-is-the-loneliest-time-for-qanon-fans \"Christmas Is the Loneliest Time for Qanon Fans\"] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''</ref></blockquote>\nSome Q followers break away when they recognize the content of the theories is not self-consistent, or they see that some of the content is directly aimed at getting donations from a specific audience, such as evangelical or conservative Christians. This then \"breaks the spell\" the conspiracies had over them. Others start watching Q-debunking videos; one former believer says that the videos \"saved\" her.<ref name=beast />\n\nDisillusionment can also come from the failure of the theories' predictions. Q had predicted Republican success in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 US midterm elections]], and claimed that [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] was involved in secret work for Trump, with apparent tensions between them a cover. When Democrats made significant gains and Trump fired Sessions, there was disillusionment among many in the Q community.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Chapman, Matthew |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/11/15/qanons-true-believers-are-devastated-as-the-conspiracy-theory-goes-down-in-flames/ |title=QAnon's true believers are devastated as the conspiracy theory goes down in flames |date=November 15, 2018|newspaper=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |author=Rothscild, Mike |url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-jeff-sessions-2018-midterms/ |title=Jeff Sessions, the 2018 midterms, and the continued grift of QAnon |date=November 9, 2018|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]}}</ref> Further disillusionment came when the predicted December 5 mass arrest and imprisonment in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] of enemies of Donald Trump did not occur, nor did the dismissal of charges against Trump's former National Security Advisor, [[Michael Flynn]]. For some these failures began the process of separation from the QAnon cult, while others urged [[direct action]] in the form of an insurrection against the government. Such a response to a failed prophecy is not unusual: apocalyptic cults such as [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]], the [[People's Temple]], the [[Manson Family]], and [[Aum Shinrikyo]] resorted to [[mass suicide]] or [[mass murder]] when their expectations for revelations or the fulfillment of their prophecies did not come about. Psychologist [[Robert Lifton]] calls it \"forcing the end\". This phenomenon is being seen among some QAnon believers.<ref name=beast /> Travis View echoes the concern that disillusioned QAnon believers might take matters into their own hands,<ref name=haaretz /> as Pizzagate believer [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory#Criminal responses|Edgar Maddison Welch]] did in 2016, [[#Hoover Dam incident|Matthew Phillip Wright]] did at [[Hoover Dam]] in 2018, and [[#Murder of Frank Cali|Anthony Comello]] did in 2019 when he murdered [[Mafia]] boss [[Frank Cali]], believing himself to be under the protection of President Trump.\n\nProminent QAnon follower Liz Crokin, who in 2018 asserted that [[John F.

According to one QAnon video, the battle between Trump and \"the cabal\" is of \"biblical proportions\", a \"fight for earth, of good versus evil.\" The forthcoming reckoning is said by some QAnon supporters to be a \"[[The Repture|reverse rapture]]\" which means not only the end of the world as it is now known, but a new beginning as well, with salvation and a utopia on earth for the survivors.<ref name=haaretz />\n\n==Appeal and disillusionment==\nWithin less than a year of existence, QAnon became significantly recognized by the general population. According to an August 2018 [[Qualtrics]] poll for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 58% of Floridians are familiar enough with QAnon to have an opinion about it. Among those who did have an opinion, most were unfavorable toward the QAnon movement. The average score on the feeling thermometer was just above 20. This is a very negative rating, and about half of what [\u2026] other political figures [\u2026] enjoy. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/30/the-qanon-conspiracy-movement-is-very-unpopular-our-new-poll-finds/|title=Analysis &#124; New poll: the QAnon conspiracy movement is very unpopular|first1=Joseph|last1=Uscinski|first2=Casey|last2=Klofstad|website=Washington Post}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/30/the-qanon-conspiracy-movement-is-very-unpopular-our-new-poll-finds/|title=New poll: the QAnon conspiracy movement is very unpopular|last=Uscinski|first=Joseph|last2=Klofstad|first2=Casey|date=August 30, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref> Positive feelings toward QAnon were found to be strongly correlated with one's proneness to conspiracy thinking.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nExperts have classified the appeal of QAnon as similar to that of religious cults. According to expert in online conspiracy Renee DiResta, the QAnon pattern is similar to enticement into cults in the pre-Internet era, where as the targeted person was led deeper and deeper into the group's secrets, they become more and more isolated from friends and family outside of the cult.<ref name=\":11\" /> In the Internet age, QAnon virtual communities have little \"real world\" connection with each other, but online, they can number in the tens of thousands.<ref name=\":11\" /> Rachel Bernstein, an expert on cults who specializes in recovery therapy, says that \"What a movement such as QAnon has going for it, and why it will catch on like wildfire, is that it makes people feel connected to something important that other people don't yet know about. ... All cults will provide this feeling of being special.\" There is no self-correction process within the group, since the self-reinforcing true believers are immune to correction, fact-checking, or counter-speech, which is drowned out in the [[groupthink]] of the cult.<ref name=\":11\">Diresta, Renee (November 13, 2018) [https://www.wired.com/story/online-conspiracy-groups-qanon-cults/ \"Online Conspiracy Groups Are a Lot Like Cults\"] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''</ref>\n\nQAnon is an example of what historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] called in 1954 \"[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]\", in which history and political trends are seen in apocalyptic terms: <blockquote>The paranoid spokesman ... traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point. Like [[millennialism|religious millennialists]] he expresses the anxiety of those who are living through the last days and he is sometimes disposed to set a date for the apocalypse... Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, what is necessary is not compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Since the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable, he must be totally eliminated &ndash; if not from the world, at least from the theatre of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention.<ref name=salon0819 /></blockquote>\n\nTravis View, a researcher who studies QAnon, says of it that it is as addictive as a video game, and offers the \"player\" the appealing possibility of being involved in something of world-historical importance. According to View, \"You can sit at your computer and search for information and then post about what you find, and Q basically promises that through this process, you are going to radically change the country, institute this incredible, almost bloodless revolution, and then be part of this historical movement that will be written about for generations.\" View compares this to mundane political involvement in which one's efforts might help to get a state legislator elected. QAnon, says View, competes not in the marketplace of ideas, but in the marketplace of realities.<ref>Rosenberg, Alyssa (August 7, 2019) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/07/qanon-isnt-just-conspiracy-theory-its-highly-effective-game/ \"I understand the temptation to dismiss QAnon. Here\u2019s why we can\u2019t.\"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref>\n\nNonetheless, some QAnon believers have eventually started to realize that they have been isolated from family and loved ones, and suffer loneliness because of it. For some, this is a pathway to slowly beginning the process of divesting themselves of their cultish beliefs, while for others, the isolation reinforces the benefits they get from belonging to the cult. View says that,\n<blockquote>People in the QAnon community often talk about alienation from family and friends. ... Though they typically talk about how Q frayed their relationships on private Facebook groups. But they think these issues are temporary and primarily the fault of others. They often comfort themselves by imagining that there will be a moment of vindication sometime in the near future which will prove their beliefs right. They imagine that after this happens, not only will their relationships be restored, but people will turn to them as leaders who understand what's going on better than the rest of us.<ref name=beast>Weill, Kelly (December 22, 2018) [https://www.thedailybeast.com/christmas-is-the-loneliest-time-for-qanon-fans \"Christmas Is the Loneliest Time for Qanon Fans\"] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''</ref></blockquote>\nSome Q followers break away when they recognize the content of the theories is not self-consistent, or they see that some of the content is directly aimed at getting donations from a specific audience, such as evangelical or conservative Christians. This then \"breaks the spell\" the conspiracies had over them. Others start watching Q-debunking videos; one former believer says that the videos \"saved\" her.<ref name=beast />\n\nDisillusionment can also come from the failure of the theories' predictions. Q had predicted Republican success in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 US midterm elections]], and claimed that [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] was involved in secret work for Trump, with apparent tensions between them a cover. When Democrats made significant gains and Trump fired Sessions, there was disillusionment among many in the Q community.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Chapman, Matthew |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/11/15/qanons-true-believers-are-devastated-as-the-conspiracy-theory-goes-down-in-flames/ |title=QAnon's true believers are devastated as the conspiracy theory goes down in flames |date=November 15, 2018|newspaper=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |author=Rothscild, Mike |url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-jeff-sessions-2018-midterms/ |title=Jeff Sessions, the 2018 midterms, and the continued grift of QAnon |date=November 9, 2018|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]}}</ref> Further disillusionment came when the predicted December 5 mass arrest and imprisonment in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] of enemies of Donald Trump did not occur, nor did the dismissal of charges against Trump's former National Security Advisor, [[Michael Flynn]]. For some these failures began the process of separation from the QAnon cult, while others urged [[direct action]] in the form of an insurrection against the government. Such a response to a failed prophecy is not unusual: apocalyptic cults such as [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]], the [[People's Temple]], the [[Manson Family]], and [[Aum Shinrikyo]] resorted to [[mass suicide]] or [[mass murder]] when their expectations for revelations or the fulfillment of their prophecies did not come about. Psychologist [[Robert Lifton]] calls it \"forcing the end\".

McGarrity, the Bureau divides domestic terrorism threats into four primary categories, \"racially motivated violent extremism, anti-government/anti-authority extremism, animal rights/environmental extremism, and abortion extremism,\" which includes both pro-choice and anti-abortion extremists.
