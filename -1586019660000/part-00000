Property acquisition began between December 1, 1941 and May 21, 1943, when 873.85 acres were acquired from the state of Arizona in an exchange for an offer of Public Domain Land from the Department of the Interior (DOI). Additionally, 394.33 acres were acquired by fee from three private individuals between February 3 and May 27, 1943, and easements totaling 9.31 acres were obtained from the state and two private individuals between February 19 and April 19, 1943 for the installation of an electric transmission line.\n\nThe original airfield was built with three runways in a triangle. Two remain: 17-35 and 5-23.  Support facilities were built, of which a {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} hangar remains. 85 buildings, a sewage treatment plant, utilities and a firing range were built. Three buildings were ordnance related.\n\nCoolidge AAF had originally been designed by the War Department as a single-engine aircraft flight training school, however, the facility initially functioned as an auxiliary field for Williams AAF as Williams Auxiliary Field No. 3.\n\nThe entire personnel of the 572nd AAF Base Unit stationed at Sky Harbor Airfield in Phoenix were moved to Coolidge AAF in May 1944. Coolidge AAF then was a ferrying service station for Air Transport Command, providing refueling and maintenance to Army, Navy, and Marine Corps planes en route to other bases, although Army Air Forces Training Command continued to use the field.\n\n===Coolidge Municipal Airport===\nCoolidge AAF was declared surplus on November 30, 1945, withdrawn from surplus effective March 21, 1946 by the Secretary of War, and again declared surplus effective August 28, 1946, by the Adjutant General. In 1948 the Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers attempted to transfer the site to the Air Force for use as an auxiliary field by [[Williams Air Force Base]] (located about 30 miles northwest), but there is no evidence the transfer was completed. The site was transferred to Pinal County by quitclaim deed dated January 19, 1950, and patent deeds dated March 14, 1953, and May 15, 1956. The site was then transferred to the city of Coolidge by quitclaim deed dated March 2, 1959.\n\nPinal County owned and operated the airport until 1959 when the City of Coolidge obtained ownership of the airport. On March 2, 1959 the airport was officially transferred from Pinal County ownership to the City of Coolidge.\n\nFrom 1962 until July 1992, operations at the airport were dominated by USAF [[T-37 Tweet|T-37]] jet training aircraft based at [[Williams Air Force Base]]. The Air Force had a lease agreement with the City of Coolidge for four parcels of land and joint use of the main runways and taxiways in return for the continued maintenance and upkeep of the main runway and taxiway. In addition, they constructed several facilities along the runway and apron to support their operations.\n\nWith Williams AFB marked for closure pursuant to [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] action, the Air Force lease was terminated in July 1992 and USAF training operations at the airport ceased in June 1992. However, among the lessees at the Coolidge Municipal Airport is CPS, a private contractor working with the DoD to conduct parachute jump training at the airport.  In addition, units from [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] periodically conduct equipment drops in the area.\n<ref>Thole, Lou (1999), Forgotten Fields of America : World War II Bases and Training, Then and Now - Vol. 2.

Since the completion of the Main Street USA project in the 1980s, Conway's downtown has been revitalized with shops and bistros. Highlighting the renovation of the downtown area is the Riverwalk, an area of restaurants which follows a stretch of the [[Waccamaw River]] that winds through Conway.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== History ==\nConway is one of the oldest towns in South Carolina. Early English colonists named the village \"Kings Town\" but soon changed it to \"Kingston\". The town was founded in 1732 as part of Royal Governor [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson's]] Township Scheme. It was laid out on a bluff overlooking the Waccamaw River in what is now known as Horry County.\n\nMany area residents fought in the [[American Revolution]], and small engagements were fought near Kingston at Bear Bluff and at Black Lake. [[Francis Marion]], who was known as the \"Swamp Fox\", had an encampment near Kingston just across the Waccamaw River.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  The areas of Kingston and Charles Town, S.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sc_tories.tripod.com/estate_confiscation_lists_of_february_1782.htm|title=Estate Confiscation Lists|website=sc_tories.tripod.com|access-date=2018-04-21}}</ref> were communities with a higher population of Tories than many other Colonial American towns during the revolutionary war era.  A Tory was a colonist who supported the government during that period.\n\nAfter the war, patriotic citizens wanted to discard the name that honored Great Britain's [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The county's name was changed to Horry (pronounced \"oh-ree\") in honor of General Peter Horry in 1801, and a courthouse was established in Kingston. \"Kingston\" was later changed to \"Conwayborough\", for General [[Robert Conway (general)|Robert Conway]]. In 1883, the General Assembly changed the name to \"Conway\".\n\n==Geography==\nConway is situated on the [[Atlantic coastal plain|South Carolina Coastal Plain]] on the western banks of the [[Waccamaw River]], and is approximately {{convert|14|mi}} from the Atlantic Ocean. [[U.S. Route 701]] passes through the city center, leading northeast {{convert|44|mi}} to [[Whiteville, North Carolina]], and southwest {{convert|36|mi}} to [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]].

[[U.S. Route 378]] has its eastern terminus in Conway and leads west {{convert|46|mi}} to [[Lake City, South Carolina|Lake City]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|59.0|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|56.8|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|2.2|km2|order=flip}}, or 3.69%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The downtown is sited on the west bank of the Waccamaw River where it is joined by a creek called Kingston Lake.

Among these is the [[Old Horry County Courthouse|City Hall building]], designed by [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]], architect of the [[Washington Monument]]. Since the completion of the Main Street USA project in the 1980s, Conway's downtown has been revitalized with shops and bistros. Highlighting the renovation of the downtown area is the Riverwalk, an area of restaurants which follows a stretch of the [[Waccamaw River]] that winds through Conway.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== History ==\nConway is one of the oldest towns in South Carolina. Early English colonists named the village \"Kings Town\" but soon changed it to \"Kingston\". The town was founded in 1732 as part of Royal Governor [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson's]] Township Scheme. It was laid out on a bluff overlooking the Waccamaw River in what is now known as Horry County.\n\nMany area residents fought in the [[American Revolution]], and small engagements were fought near Kingston at Bear Bluff and at Black Lake. [[Francis Marion]], who was known as the \"Swamp Fox\", had an encampment near Kingston just across the Waccamaw River.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  The areas of Kingston and Charles Town, S.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sc_tories.tripod.com/estate_confiscation_lists_of_february_1782.htm|title=Estate Confiscation Lists|website=sc_tories.tripod.com|access-date=2018-04-21}}</ref> were communities with a higher population of Tories than many other Colonial American towns during the revolutionary war era.  A Tory was a colonist who supported the government during that period.\n\nAfter the war, patriotic citizens wanted to discard the name that honored Great Britain's [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The county's name was changed to Horry (pronounced \"oh-ree\") in honor of General Peter Horry in 1801, and a courthouse was established in Kingston. \"Kingston\" was later changed to \"Conwayborough\", for General [[Robert Conway (general)|Robert Conway]]. In 1883, the General Assembly changed the name to \"Conway\".\n\n==Geography==\nConway is situated on the [[Atlantic coastal plain|South Carolina Coastal Plain]] on the western banks of the [[Waccamaw River]], and is approximately {{convert|14|mi}} from the Atlantic Ocean. [[U.S. Route 701]] passes through the city center, leading northeast {{convert|44|mi}} to [[Whiteville, North Carolina]], and southwest {{convert|36|mi}} to [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]]. [[U.S. Route 501]] runs through the southwest side of Conway, leading southeast {{convert|14|mi}} to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] and northwest {{convert|33|mi}} to [[Marion, South Carolina|Marion]]. [[U.S. Route 378]] has its eastern terminus in Conway and leads west {{convert|46|mi}} to [[Lake City, South Carolina|Lake City]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|59.0|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|56.8|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|2.2|km2|order=flip}}, or 3.69%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The downtown is sited on the west bank of the Waccamaw River where it is joined by a creek called Kingston Lake. The Waccamaw flows south to the [[Pee Dee River]] and ultimately [[Winyah Bay]] at Georgetown.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 476\n|1870= 696\n|1880= 575\n|1890= 677\n|1900= 705\n|1910= 1228\n|1920= 1969\n|1930= 3011\n|1940= 5066\n|1950= 6073\n|1960= 8563\n|1970= 8151\n|1980= 10240\n|1990= 9819\n|2000= 11788\n|2010= 17103\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24980\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=May 12, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Conway Railroad.jpg|thumb|left|Trains in front of the Conway watertower]]\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 11,788 people, 4,259 households, and 2,942 families residing in the city.
