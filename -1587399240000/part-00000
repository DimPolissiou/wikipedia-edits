In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that \"religious duty\" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration \u2014|od|1}}</ref> Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]\" groups still practicing polygamy.<ref>{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].\n\n==Teachings and practices==\n\n===Authorized texts===\n[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]\nThe theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"[[standard works]]\". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as \"the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion\".<ref>{{citation |title= History of the Church |volume= 4 |page= 461|title-link= History of the Church (Joseph Smith) }}</ref>\n\nThe Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly\".<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nAnother source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].

LDS Church theology includes the belief in a \"[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]\" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead.

Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.\n\nThe main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith.

In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.\n\nIn the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.\n[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]\n\nAs the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.\n\nAcademic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.\n\n[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.\n\nDuring the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199358229|pages=132\u2013137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Religion Journal; Spiritual Issues Lead Many to the Net | author = Sink, Mindy |work=The New York Times\n | date = September 6, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DB1F38F935A3575AC0A9659C8B63 | accessdate =February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|title=Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=20 Jul 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe church's support in 2008 of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] sparked heated debate and protest by gay-rights organizations and others.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage | author = Jesse McKinley and Kirk Johnson |work=The New York Times | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate =February 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |title=San Diego march for marriage equality draws 20,000 protesters |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |work=Gay & Lesbian Times |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090214121324/http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/california-and-same-sex-marriage |title= Commentary: California and Same-Sex Marriage |date= June 30, 2008 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}</ref> The church expressed support for a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the [[gay community|LGBT community]] against discrimination in employment and housing while allowing religious institutions to consider lifestyles in actions such as hiring or providing university accommodations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705343558/Mormon-Church-backs-protection-of-gay-rights-in-Salt-Lake-City.html |title= Mormon Church Backs Gay Protecting City Ordinances |newspaper= Deseret News |first= Scott |last= Taylor |date= November 10, 2009}}</ref> Further controversy resulted in late 2015, when the church changed its guidance to lay leaders about same-sex unions and about minor children living in the home of a parent in a same-sex relationship, whether natural or adopted.<ref name=SaltLakeTrib>{{cite news|last=Dobner|first=Jennifer|title=New Mormon policy makes apostates of married same-sex couples, bars children from rites|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3144035&itype=CMSID|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> The policy said that these children should only be baptized after reaching legal age, and only if they did not live with parents who were in a same-sex cohabitation or marriage.

United States]]'', decreed that \"religious duty\" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration \u2014|od|1}}</ref> Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]\" groups still practicing polygamy.<ref>{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].\n\n==Teachings and practices==\n\n===Authorized texts===\n[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]\nThe theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"[[standard works]]\". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as \"the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion\".<ref>{{citation |title= History of the Church |volume= 4 |page= 461|title-link= History of the Church (Joseph Smith) }}</ref>\n\nThe Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly\".<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nAnother source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the church's president and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets<ref name=\"oct12_conference\">{{Citation |title= The Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Henry B. |last= Eyring |authorlink= Henry B.

LDS Church theology includes the belief in a \"[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]\" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead.

Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.\n\nThe main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith.

In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.\n\nIn the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.\n[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]\n\nAs the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.\n\nAcademic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.\n\n[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.\n\nDuring the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199358229|pages=132\u2013137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Religion Journal; Spiritual Issues Lead Many to the Net | author = Sink, Mindy |work=The New York Times\n | date = September 6, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DB1F38F935A3575AC0A9659C8B63 | accessdate =February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|title=Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=20 Jul 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe church's support in 2008 of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] sparked heated debate and protest by gay-rights organizations and others.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage | author = Jesse McKinley and Kirk Johnson |work=The New York Times | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate =February 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |title=San Diego march for marriage equality draws 20,000 protesters |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |work=Gay & Lesbian Times |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090214121324/http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/california-and-same-sex-marriage |title= Commentary: California and Same-Sex Marriage |date= June 30, 2008 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}</ref> The church expressed support for a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the [[gay community|LGBT community]] against discrimination in employment and housing while allowing religious institutions to consider lifestyles in actions such as hiring or providing university accommodations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705343558/Mormon-Church-backs-protection-of-gay-rights-in-Salt-Lake-City.html |title= Mormon Church Backs Gay Protecting City Ordinances |newspaper= Deseret News |first= Scott |last= Taylor |date= November 10, 2009}}</ref> Further controversy resulted in late 2015, when the church changed its guidance to lay leaders about same-sex unions and about minor children living in the home of a parent in a same-sex relationship, whether natural or adopted.<ref name=SaltLakeTrib>{{cite news|last=Dobner|first=Jennifer|title=New Mormon policy makes apostates of married same-sex couples, bars children from rites|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3144035&itype=CMSID|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> The policy said that these children should only be baptized after reaching legal age, and only if they did not live with parents who were in a same-sex cohabitation or marriage.

These [[Religious sister|sisters]], whose order was founded in 1831 by Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, have been active in Cedar Rapids since 1875. The college was an outgrowth of their concerns about the education of women.\n\nIn 1957, Mount Mercy became a four-year institution and awarded its first bachelor's degree in 1959. The college received accreditation as a baccalaureate institution by the North Central Association in 1960. In 1968 the Sisters of Mercy transferred their legal authority and responsibility to a self-perpetuating independent board of which three members would always be Sisters of Mercy.  Mount Mercy College became coeducational in 1969. While integrating a strong liberal arts component, the college has always emphasized professional development from its early involvement, as a junior college, on business courses and teacher education. The departments of nursing, education, and social work were accredited in the 1960s and 1970s as the four-year programs developed. Begun in 1997, the Adult Accelerated program, a joint Mount Mercy University/Kirkwood Community College accelerated degree completion program for working adults meets an important community workforce development need.\n\nOn August 23, 2010, the institution was re-designated as a university.\n\n===Presidents===\n*Sister Mary Ildephonse Holland, 1928\u20131933, 1946\u20131961\n*Sister Mary Cornelia Burke, 1933 to 1939\n*Sister Mary Maura Marron, 1939\u20131946\n*Sister Mary Agnes Hennessey, 1961\u20131977\n*Dr. Thomas R.

These [[Religious sister|sisters]], whose order was founded in 1831 by Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, have been active in Cedar Rapids since 1875. The college was an outgrowth of their concerns about the education of women.\n\nIn 1957, Mount Mercy became a four-year institution and awarded its first bachelor's degree in 1959. The college received accreditation as a baccalaureate institution by the North Central Association in 1960. In 1968 the Sisters of Mercy transferred their legal authority and responsibility to a self-perpetuating independent board of which three members would always be Sisters of Mercy.  Mount Mercy College became coeducational in 1969. While integrating a strong liberal arts component, the college has always emphasized professional development from its early involvement, as a junior college, on business courses and teacher education. The departments of nursing, education, and social work were accredited in the 1960s and 1970s as the four-year programs developed. Begun in 1997, the Adult Accelerated program, a joint Mount Mercy University/Kirkwood Community College accelerated degree completion program for working adults meets an important community workforce development need.\n\nOn August 23, 2010, the institution was re-designated as a university.\n\n===Presidents===\n*Sister Mary Ildephonse Holland, 1928\u20131933, 1946\u20131961\n*Sister Mary Cornelia Burke, 1933 to 1939\n*Sister Mary Maura Marron, 1939\u20131946\n*Sister Mary Agnes Hennessey, 1961\u20131977\n*Dr. Thomas R.

Astorga]] (then Vice Mayor of Manila) on June 24, 1962. It has been annually commemorated under the [[patron saint|patronage]] of [[John the Baptist]], and has always been declared by the national government as a special non-working holiday through Presidential Proclamations. Each of the city's 896 barangays also have their own festivities guided by their own [[patron saint]].\n\nThe city is also the host to the [[Black Nazarene|Procession of the Feast of the Black Nazarene]] (''Traslac\u00edon''), held every January 9, which draws millions of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] devotees. Other religious festivities held in Manila are the Feast of Santo Ni\u00f1o in Tondo and Pandacan held on the third Sunday of January, the Feast of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Desamparados de Manila (Our Lady of the Abandoned), the patron saint of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] which was held every May 12, and the ''[[Flores de Mayo]]''.

The historic Walled City is administered by the [[Intramuros Administration]], while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies. The barangays that have jurisdictions over these places only oversee the welfare of the city's constituents and cannot exercise their executive powers. Manila has a total of 15,489 personnel complement by the end of 2018.<ref name=\"2018audit\" />\n\nThe current [[Mayor of Manila|mayor]] is Francisco \"[[Isko Moreno]]\" Domagoso, who previously served as the city's vice mayor. The current vice mayor is Dr. Maria Shielah \"Honey\" Lacuna-Pangan, daughter of former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Lacuna. The mayor and the vice mayor are term-limited by up to 3 terms, with each term lasting for 3 years.\n\n[[File:Palacio Del Gobernador.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio del Gobernador]] in Intramuros is home to the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] and Intramuros Administration.]]\nManila, being the seat of political power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonization]] when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to [[Daniel Burnham]] to create a master plan for the city patterned after [[Washington, D.C.]] These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of [[Manuel L. Quezon]].\n\nA new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.\n\nThe city, as the capital, still hosts the Office of the President, as well as the president's official residence. Aside from these, important government agencies and institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Departments]] of [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Budget and Management]], [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Finance]], [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Health]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]], [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]] and [[Department of Public Works and Highways|Public Works and Highways]] still call the city home. Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital.\n\nCongress previously held office at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Congress Building]]. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the [[unicameral]] [[Batasang Pambansa]], held office at the new [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. When a new [[constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] restored the [[bicameral]] Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the [[Government Service Insurance System]] at reclaimed land at [[Pasay]].

Museums established or run by educational institutions are the [[Mabini Shrine (Manila)|Mabini Shrine]], the DLS-CSB Museum of Contemporary Art and Design, [[UST Museum of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[University of the Philippines Museum of a History of Ideas|UP Museum of a History of Ideas]].\n[[File:National Museum of Natural History (Manila) Facade - Front View.jpg|thumb|left|The [[National Museum of Natural History (Manila)|National Museum of Natural History]] at Agrifina Circle, [[Rizal Park]].]]\n\n[[Bahay Tsinoy]], one of Manila's most prominent museums, documents the Chinese lives and contributions in the history of the Philippines. The Intramuros Light and Sound Museum chronicles the Filipinos desire for freedom during [[Philippine Revolution|the revolution]] under Rizal's leadership and other revolutionary leaders. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Manila]] is a museum of modern and contemporary visual arts exhibits the Filipino arts and [[Culture of the Philippines|culture]].\n\nOther museums in the city are the Museum of Manila, the city-owned museum that exhibits the city's culture and history, [[Museo Pambata]], a children's museum and a place of hands-on discovery and fun learning, and Plaza San Luis which is an outdoor heritage public museum that contains a collection of nine Spanish Bahay na Bat\u00f3 houses. Ecclesiastical museums in the located in the city are the Parish of the Our Lady of the Abandoned in Santa Ana, the [[San Agustin Church (Manila)|San Agustin Church Museum]] and the [[Museo de Intramuros]] which houses the ecclesiastical art collection of the [[Intramuros Administration]] in the reconstructed [[San Ignacio Church (Manila)|San Ignacio Church and Convent]].\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Rizal_Memorial_Sports_Complex_birdseye.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the city-owned [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]], considered as the national sports complex of the Philippines.]]\n[[File:Basketball in Intramuros.jpg|thumb|Children playing basketball at the ruins of [[San Ignacio Church (Manila)|San Ignacio Church]] in Intramuros]]\n[[File:Intramurosjf0400 16.JPG|thumb|The Intramuros Golf Club]]\n\nSports in Manila have a long and distinguished history. The city's, and in general the country's main sport is [[basketball]], and most barangays have a basketball court or at least a makeshift basketball court, with court markings drawn on the streets. Larger barangays have covered courts where inter-barangay leagues are held every summer (April to May). Manila has many sports venues, such as the [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]] and San Andres Gym, the home of the now defunct [[Manila Metrostars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Manila-Sports.html |title=Manila: Sports |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> The Rizal Memorial Sports Complex houses the [[Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium]], [[Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium|the Baseball Stadium]], Tennis Courts, the [[Rizal Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Ninoy Aquino Stadium]] (the latter two are indoor arenas). The Rizal complex had hosted several multi-sport events, such as the [[1954 Asian Games]] and the [[1934 Far Eastern Games]]. Whenever the country hosts the [[Southeast Asian Games]], most of the events are held at the complex, but in the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 Games]], most events were held elsewhere. The [[1960 ABC Championship]] and the [[1973 ABC Championship]], forerunners of the [[FIBA Asia Championship]], was hosted by the memorial coliseum, with the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|national basketball team]] winning on both tournaments. The [[1978 FIBA World Championship]] was held at the coliseum although the latter stages were held in the [[Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena at that time.\n\nManila also hosts several well-known sports facilities such as the [[Enrique M. Razon Sports Center]] and the [[University of Santo Tomas Sports Complex]], both of which are private venues owned by a university; collegiate sports are also held, with the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] basketball games held at Rizal Memorial Coliseum and Ninoy Aquino Stadium, although basketball events had transferred to [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]'s [[Filoil Flying V Arena]] and the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Other collegiate sports are still held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. Professional basketball also used to play at the city, but the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] now holds their games at Araneta Coliseum and [[Cuneta Astrodome]] at [[Pasay]]; the now defunct [[Philippine Basketball League]] played some of their games at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.\n\nThe [[Manila Storm]] are the city's [[rugby league]] team training at Rizal Park (Luneta Park) and playing their matches at Southern Plains Field, [[Calamba, Laguna]]. Previously a widely played sport in the city, Manila is now the home of the only sizable [[baseball]] stadium in the country, at the [[Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium]]. The stadium hosts games of [[Baseball Philippines]]; [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Babe Ruth]] were the first players to score a [[home run]] at the stadium at their tour of the country on December 2, 1934.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/158970 |title=Baseball loses no time in preparing for SEAG |first=Tito |last=Talao |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=March 10, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913053124/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/158970 |archivedate=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}</ref> Another popular sport in the city are [[cue sports]], and billiard halls are a feature in most barangays.

Manila Day, which celebrates the city's founding on June 24, 1571 by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ''[[conquistador]]'' [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]], was first proclaimed by [[Herminio A. Astorga]] (then Vice Mayor of Manila) on June 24, 1962. It has been annually commemorated under the [[patron saint|patronage]] of [[John the Baptist]], and has always been declared by the national government as a special non-working holiday through Presidential Proclamations. Each of the city's 896 barangays also have their own festivities guided by their own [[patron saint]].\n\nThe city is also the host to the [[Black Nazarene|Procession of the Feast of the Black Nazarene]] (''Traslac\u00edon''), held every January 9, which draws millions of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] devotees. Other religious festivities held in Manila are the Feast of Santo Ni\u00f1o in Tondo and Pandacan held on the third Sunday of January, the Feast of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Desamparados de Manila (Our Lady of the Abandoned), the patron saint of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] which was held every May 12, and the ''[[Flores de Mayo]]''. Non-religious holidays include the [[New Year's Day]], [[National Heroes' Day]], [[Bonifacio Day]] and [[Rizal Day]].\n\n==Law and government==\n[[File:Intramurosjf0305 17.JPG|thumb|left|[[Manila City Hall]], the seat of city government.]]\n\nManila\u2014officially known as the City of Manila\u2014is the [[capital city|national capital]] of the Philippines and is classified as a Special City (according to its income)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blgf.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/updated-reclassification-Cities.pdf |title= Income Classification Per DOF Order No. 23-08, dated July 29, 2008 |publisher= Bureau of Local Government Finance |access-date= December 31, 2016 |website=  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231151123/http://blgf.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/updated-reclassification-Cities.pdf |archive-date= December 31, 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbm.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Manual-on-PCC-Chapter-9.pdf|title=Position Classification and Compensation Scheme in Local Government Units|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Budget and Management|access-date=}}</ref> and a [[Cities of the Philippines#classification|Highly Urbanized City]] (HUC).

The members of the City Council are elected as representatives of specific congressional districts within the city. The city, however, have no control over Intramuros and the Manila North Harbor. The historic Walled City is administered by the [[Intramuros Administration]], while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies. The barangays that have jurisdictions over these places only oversee the welfare of the city's constituents and cannot exercise their executive powers. Manila has a total of 15,489 personnel complement by the end of 2018.<ref name=\"2018audit\" />\n\nThe current [[Mayor of Manila|mayor]] is Francisco \"[[Isko Moreno]]\" Domagoso, who previously served as the city's vice mayor. The current vice mayor is Dr. Maria Shielah \"Honey\" Lacuna-Pangan, daughter of former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Lacuna. The mayor and the vice mayor are term-limited by up to 3 terms, with each term lasting for 3 years.\n\n[[File:Palacio Del Gobernador.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio del Gobernador]] in Intramuros is home to the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] and Intramuros Administration.]]\nManila, being the seat of political power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonization]] when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to [[Daniel Burnham]] to create a master plan for the city patterned after [[Washington, D.C.]] These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of [[Manuel L. Quezon]].\n\nA new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.\n\nThe city, as the capital, still hosts the Office of the President, as well as the president's official residence. Aside from these, important government agencies and institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Departments]] of [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Budget and Management]], [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Finance]], [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Health]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]], [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]] and [[Department of Public Works and Highways|Public Works and Highways]] still call the city home. Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital.\n\nCongress previously held office at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Congress Building]]. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the [[unicameral]] [[Batasang Pambansa]], held office at the new [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. When a new [[constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] restored the [[bicameral]] Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the [[Government Service Insurance System]] at reclaimed land at [[Pasay]]. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] will also transfer to its new campus at [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Taguig]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/608294/sc-picks-phl-flag-inspired-design-for-new-green-building-in-taguig/story|title=SC picks PHL flag-inspired design for new 'green' building in Taguig|last=Lopez|first=Virgil|date=April 25, 2017|website=GMA News|access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Finance ===\n\nIn the 2018 Annual Audit Report published by the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]], it is stated that the total revenue of the City of Manila amounts to \u20b114.1 billion.<ref name=\"2018audit\">{{cite web |url=https://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2018/category/7732-cities |title= 2018 Annual Audit Reports |publisher=[[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]] |accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref> It is one of the cities with the highest tax collection and internal revenue allotment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philippinestodayus.com/news/metro/quezon-city-makati-richest-cities-in-rp/ |title=Quezon City, Makati richest cities in RP |publisher=Philippine Today US |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024161259/http://www.philippinestodayus.com/news/metro/quezon-city-makati-richest-cities-in-rp/ |archivedate=October 24, 2011  }}</ref> Manila collects an annual tax revenue amounting to \u20b17.3 billion.
