The series is produced by [[Sajid Nadiadwala]]. The series stars [[Akshay Kumar]] and [[Ritesh Deshmukh]] as lead cast and [[Boman Irani]] and [[Chunkey Pandey]] in supporting roles as Batuk Patel and Aakhri Pasta respectively. [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] has also appeared in first three films, she however made a special appearance in the first film and played a pivotal role in the second and the third film. Malaika made cameos in the first two movies but didn't appear in the third one. The fourth film, ''[[Housefull 4]]'' featured [[Bobby Deol]], [[Kriti Sanon]], [[Kriti Kharbanda]], [[Pooja Hegde]] and [[Rana Daggubati]] in addition to regular cast. Based on reincarnation theme, it is the most expensive Indian comedy film ever made. [[Farhad Samji]] directed the fourth film.\nEach film starts with a fresh story unrelated with the preceding film's story. However, the theme and the pace remains the same.\n\n==Overview==\n===''Housefull'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Housefull (2010 film)}}\nAarush, ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a jinxed loser who stays with his friend, Bob ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]) and his wife, Hetal ([[Lara Dutta]]), both working at a [[casino]] owned by Mr.Kishore Samtani ([[Randhir Kapoor]]). Although at first Hetal is displeased with Aarush's presence, he proves to be a kind-hearted man looking for family. Bob and Hetal decide to marry him to their boss' daughter, Devika Samtani ([[Jiah Khan]]). After the marriage, on their honeymoon in Italy, Devika leaves him for her long-time American boyfriend Benny. Dejected, Aarush tries to commit suicide by drowning in the sea but is saved by a girl Sandy ([[Deepika Padukone]]).\n\nSandy originally thinks Aarush is a pervert, but when Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), the owner of Italy's biggest hotel where Aarush was spending his honeymoon with Devika, tells Sandy that Aarush is a widower, she befriends him and slowly falls in love with him. What she does not know, is that Aakhri Pasta was only joking. She then finds out his wife is alive and leaves him, but he tells her the whole truth to make her understand and she accepts him.\n\nThe only way Aarush can marry Sandy is by convincing her elder brother, Major Krishna Rao ([[Arjun Rampal]]), a strict Indian Military Intelligence officer who loves and is over-protective of Sandy. Meanwhile, Hetal, in an attempt to reconcile, lies to her father, Batuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]), that Bob owns a mansion and they have a child. The four rent a mansion to make him believe that Bob owns it, but Batuk accidentally believes that Aarush is married to Hetal, and Bob is the cook. Then, Krishna turns up, much to Aarush's horror, leading to more lies.\n\nFor half of the term, the four must pretend that the mansion is owned by Bob, and the rest must pretend that Aarush owns it. An overly suspicious Krishna sees Bob and Hetal working at the casino and uses a lie detector to find the truth. After Sandy objects, Krishna apologises and agrees to Aarush and Sandy's marriage. The whole family is invited to the Royal Palace, to see Krishna get rewarded by the Queen of England. While this is happening, two workers are meant to be installing air conditioning gas for the place, however instead they accidentally supply the hall with laughing gas causing everyone to break into an outburst of laughter. During this laughter, the truth is let out but no one seems to be in the right state of mind.\n\nThe two workers meanwhile stop the gas from spreading \u2013 and its effect passes. Aarush is still telling Krishna the truth, leading Krishna to break off Sandy's engagement. However, after Sandy tearfully pleads with him, Krishna lets the two get married. In the end, Hetal and Bob live together with Batuk Patel, and Aarush's luck changes for the better.\n\n===''Housefull 2'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Housefull 2}}\nThis film is an adaptation of the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film \"Dam Dam Diga Diga\", released in 2008 and Telugu film [[Hungama (2005 film)|Hungama]], released in 2005, which is a remake of Malayalam movie [[Mattupetti Machan]], released in 1998,\nThe two cousins Heena ([[Asin Thottumkal]]) and Bobby ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), daughters of the Kapoor family, hate each other very much. They start quarrelling over something relating to their duties of Animals' Law Authority. Their fathers, Chintu ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) and Dabboo ([[Randhir Kapoor]]), are step-brothers who hate each other to the very core. Even their wives hate each other. Chintu wants the richest son-in law for his daughter, Heena, while Dabboo too wants the same for his daughter, Bobby. Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a marriage counsellor, is ordered by both Chintu and Dabboo to find the best son-in-law. Aakhri Pasta brings Mr. Babani ([[Virendra Saxena]]) to discuss Babani's son Jai.\n\nWhen Chintu misinterprets one of Aakhri's comments, he verbally abuses Babani while shouting. Babani suffers from a condition that affects his heart when he hears loud noises. Due to Chintu's shouting, Babani suffers a heart attack, landing him in a hospital. Babani's son Jai ([[Shreyas Talpade]]) comes to know of this and gets angry, then vows revenge, telling his friend Jolly/Jwala ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]), who is the son of billionaire J.D. ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]), to go to Chintu, agree to marry his daughter and then break off the wedding at the last minute. Jolly is busy trying to introduce his girlfriend to his own father and does not want to get involved. He suggests Max ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), their former college mate and a thief, to do the job. Jay goes with Max as his driver but somehow, they end in the wrong house and go to Dabboo's house.\n\nJay and Max later find out their mistake. Jai, still wanting revenge, doesn't know what to do and Jolly suggests another former sleazy college mate, Sunny ([[Akshay Kumar]]). Jolly goes with Sunny as his bodyguard because Max and Sunny are sworn enemies and as Dabboo's house and Chintu's house are right next to each other, their plan may fail. Sunny and Jolly encounter a crocodile and Max and Jay encounter a snake. They manage to survive the attack.\n\nWhile Heena and Bobby are on a cruise, they accidentally end up on an island. Max and Sunny become friends again, while Heena and Bobby become friends. They find a resort and go home. Dabboo gets Jolly (Max) engaged to Bobby and Chintu gets Jolly (Sunny) engaged to Heena. The day of the engagement, Chintu blindfolds Jolly, Sunny, Jai and Heena and takes them to J.D.'s house. After seeing the real Jolly holding Sunny's garland, J.D. believes that Jolly got engaged to Heena. Luckily, Sunny convinces him. Jolly calls them at midnight and reveals his father's secret of being Jagga Daaku. He also reveals that his real name is Jwala. After Sunny fools Chintu, Chintu calls Dabboo in excitement and tells him that his daughter, Heena, is marrying Jolly, the son of J.D. Confused, and believing Max to be Jolly, Dabboo takes Max and Bobby to J.D.'s mansion. Sunny handles the situation well by fooling J.D. by taking the name of his religion and tells him that Max is Jolly's friend and Bobby is Max's fianc\u00e9 (though actually it is true) and Max's father is against his and Bobby's marriage. J.D. then welcomes Bobby, Max and her family to his house and tells them to stay there up to Bobby and Max's marriage.\n\nBatuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) arrives with his daughter Parul ([[Shazahn Padamsee]]) to make things worse. Jay and Jwala come to receive them from the airport. But when they see Parul, Jay and Jwala lie that Jay is Jolly. Parul becomes happy hearing this as they secretly love each other. Jelo ([[Zarine Khan]]) gives Jwala the ultimatum &nbsp;\u2013 take me to your house or forget me. To help Jwala, Sunny lies to J.D., saying that Jelo is his fianc\u00e9, and J.D. again agrees to let her live there as Sunny takes the name of his religion. Sunny and Max lie to their respective fathers-in-law that the other guy is the son of J.D. and a maid servant in the mansion. This creates a lot of confusion.\n\nWhen Sunny's father as well as Max's 'Guru' tells them never to break anyone's heart, Sunny and Max tell the truth to Heena and Bobby. Enraged, Bobby and Heena slap Max and Sunny respectively and tell them that they never want to see their faces again. But thinking that instead of telling the truth, Sunny and Max could have done more wrong with them, the two sisters pardon the two boys on the very next day. There Jay and Jolly also let off their plan of revenge on Kapoors on Jay's father's advice. Then Henna proposes Sunny in Sunny's style and Bobby proposes Max in Max's style.\n\nOn the day of the four couples' marriage, J.D. and the other brides' fathers learn the truth about the grooms and that they have been lying all this time. Finally Bobby and Heena convince their fathers to forget their enmity and live together as blood brothers. Chintu and Dabboo join hands and so do their wives. But J.D. was not convinced by them telling the truth, so he turns back into Jagga Daku and starts frightening the families with his gun. He tries to shoot Sunny with his gun as Sunny runs towards J.D. to save him from the falling chandelier and then he understands what was happening. In the end, all the grooms marry their respective girlfriends.\n\n===''Housefull 3'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Housefull 3}}\nSix years ago in London, three robbers attempted to steal jewels from a building, but were stopped by the police and arrested. In the present, Batook Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) is a wealthy and successful businessman with three beautiful daughters: Ganga ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), Jamuna ([[Lisa Haydon]]), and Saraswati ([[Nargis Fakhri]]). However, he does not want his daughters to get married, as he claims that all the women in his family are cursed if they get married.\n\nOne night, at a friend's bachelorette party, the girls reveal to their friend that secretly, they each have a boyfriend. Jamuna's boyfriend is Teddy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), who wants to be a racecar driver. Teddy is skilled at racing, but during an important race, his car runs out of gas, and loses. Saraswati's boyfriend is Bunty ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), who wants to be rapper. During a talent competition, the judge claims that his rapping talent is ordinary. Bunty then raps in Hindi swear words at the judge. Unfortunately, the judge knows Hindi, and disqualifies him. Ganga's boyfriend is Sandy ([[Akshay Kumar]]), who wants to be a professional football/soccer player. During tryouts for a team, the coach, who is racist, tells him he cannot join, and calls him a \"Bloody Indian\", which triggers Sandy's evil personality, Sundi, to come out and attack the coach and team. Sandy learns that Sundi comes out whenever he hears the word \"Indian\", and his Dissociative Identity Disorder comes from being depressed about not having enough money to make a living. Sandy sees Batook's success in the paper, and decides to date his doctor, and Batook's daughter, Ganga. When the girls tell their dad that they each have a boyfriend, Batook goes to his friend, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), who owns an Italian restaurant. Batook convinces Pasta to dress up as the family's fortune teller, Aakhri Aasta. Aasta claims that when Ganga's husband first steps foot into Batook's house, Jamuna's husband first sees Batook, or when Saraswati's husband first speaks to Batook, then Batook will have a heart attack, and die. The girls, wanting to keep their boyfriends, have them fake disabilities. Sandy rides around in a motorized wheelchair, and claims he can't use his feet. Teddy wears sunglasses and uses a cane, and claims he is blind. Bunty uses sign language, and claims that he is mute. Batook decides to test the boys to make sure if they are really disabled, by putting ants in Sandy's pants, having Teddy jump in an empty pool, and injuring Bunty to see if he screams. When Batook is out of the house, the boys reveal themselves to each other as not being disabled. Since they all want Batook's money, they decide not to tell on each other, as they each have a recording of the other. At Pasta's restaurant, Batook reveals to Pasta that his daughters are actually the daughters of Urja Nagre ([[Jackie Shroff]]), an underworld crime lord. Nagre was caught when someone informed the police. While in jail, Nagre requested Batook take care of his daughters in London, but make sure that they never found out that Nagre was their father. Batook also reveals that he was the one who informed the police, and did not want the girls to marry until his sons(the robbers in the beginning of the film) got out of prison. Unbeknownst to him, Nagre is out of prison, and has arrived in London.\n\nWhile the girls prepare a wax statue for Batook, the boys go into town, where some gangsters are teasing some girls. Suddenly, Nagre appears, and attack the gangsters. After the gangsters run away, Nagre sees the boys, and ask why did not help. The boys claim that they were disabled. Bunty, who was in the wheelchair at the time, claims he was crippled. Sandy, holding Teddy's cane, claims he is blind, and that Teddy is mute. Later, Nagre goes to Batook's office, and ask him about his daughters's future husbands. Batook says that while the girls' future husbands are disabled, he knows three normal men who are suitable for the daughters. Batook takes Nagre to a Gurdwara to see his sons, Rishi ([[Samir Kochhar]]), Rohan ([[Nikitin Dheer]]), and Rajeev ([[Aarav Chowdhary]]), claiming they are orphans who do community service. Nagre decides that the three are suitable for his daughters.\n\nAt Batook's house, Nagre claims that Batook owes Nagre 5000 crores (50 billion) of British Pounds. Nagre gives Batook and the boys 10 days to make up the money, or Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswati must marry Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev. During these ten days, Nagre and his \"sons\" will also live in Batook's house, meaning that while in front of both Batook and Nagre, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty must act as blind-disabled, mute-blind, and disabled-mute. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty come up with a plan to get rid of Nagre's sons. During a St. Patrick's Day party, the girls get Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev drunk. The next day, they tell each other that they had sex with their respective girls, only to find out that they had sex with the maids. The maids request compensation, or they will sue, of 50 million Pounds. Nagre, learning this, says that the girls will marry the boys of their choosing.\n\nThe next day, the girls take Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty to church, asking for forgiveness. Saraswati, who takes care of disabled children, tells them that two boys were mocking a child because of his disability. The girls feel guilty, because they felt that they were mocking people with disabilities by having the boys act as if they were blind, crippled, and mute. After this, the boys feel guilty, as they were only marrying the girls for money. They go to the warehouse area of Madame Tussauds to meet their girlfriends. They instead find Batook's sons, who explain that they found out the boys were normal. While Teddy and Bunty fight Batook's sons' gang members, Sandy has accidentally heard Teddy say \"Indian\", and Sundi, Sandy's alternate personality, tries to kill Sandy. Batook arrives, and blackmails the boys that Nagre's fortune of 50 million will be divided into 7 parts: Rishi, Rohan, Rajeev, Batook, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty's shares. Sundi says to divide it into 8 shares, as Sandy/Sundi counts as two people. Aakhri Pasta arrives, and demands his share, splitting it into 9 parts. However, the three maids each demand two shares, one for them, and the other for their unborn children they are now carrying. Nagre then arrives, and explains that he found a recording on Bunty's laptop, which revealed that Bunty, Sandy, and Teddy were not disabled. Nagre also overheard Batook, who told his sons that he was responsible for Nagre's imprisonment. Nagre then attempts to kill everyone in the warehouse, while the lights turn on and off. As the girls arrive, Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev see them, and hold them at knifepoint in front of Nagre. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty then rush to save the girls, injuring themselves in the process. As they lay in the girls arms, the boys tell the truth to the girls, and Batook explains how Nagre is their father. The girls forgive the boys, and reconcile with Nagre.\n\n===''Housefull 4'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Housefull 4}}\nHarry ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a barber who frequently gets bizarre flashes of a past era. He runs a barber shop in London with his brothers Roy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Max ([[Bobby Deol]]). The three brothers had misplaced a bag of 5 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] which belonged to gangster Michael Bhai. His henchman Big Bhai ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) constantly demands the money. To fulfil this demand, the three brothers get engaged to the three daughters of London's rich business tycoon Thakral ([[Ranjeet]]): Harry is dating Pooja ([[Pooja Hegde]]), Roy is dating Neha ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]) and Max is dating Kriti ([[Kriti Sanon]]). Mysterious circumstances cause the destination wedding to take place in Sitamgarh, India. On arriving in Sitamgarh, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a bellboy at their hotel, recognises them as reincarnations of people that lived 600 years ago, i.e. in 1419. Harry realises that the flashes he sees have something to do with what Pasta was talking about and drives to the nearby town of [[Madhavgarh]], where he starts to see the flashes clearly.\n\nIn 1419, Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) of Madhavgarh was banished by his father, Maharaj Parikshitap ([[Parikshit Sahni]]), since Bala tried to kill him to become King. Bala's servant Pehla Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]) informs him of Sitamgarh - a nearby kingdom whose King, Maharaj Surya Singh Rana ([[Ranjeet]]), is looking for grooms for his three daughters: Rajkumari Madhu ([[Kriti Sanon]]), Rajkumari Mala ([[Pooja Hegde]]) and Rajkumari Meena ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]). Bala plans to marry Rajkumari Madhu, the eldest Princess, so that he becomes the King of Sitamgarh.\n\nBala meets Bangdu Maharaj ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), an effeminate dance teacher who has an affair with Mala. Meena is secretly in love with the brave bodyguard of the three princesses, Dharamputra ([[Bobby Deol]]). Bala helps the two couples get together and enlists their help for uniting him with Madhu. The plan works and Maharaj Surya Singh Rana announces the wedding of Madhu with Bala, Mala with Bangdu Maharaj, and Meena with Dharamputra. However, Suryabhan ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), Surya Singh Rana's nephew, wants the throne for himself. He kills the brother of Sitamgarh's enemy clan's leader, Gama ([[Rana Daggubati]]) and frames the three couples for it. On the day of the wedding, Gama storms into the fort and fights them to avenge his brother. During the fight, Bala realises that he now truly loves Madhu, even though initially she was just the path to the throne for him. During the fight, the wedding [[Mandapa|mandap]] (altar) collapses and kills the three couples along with Gama.\n\nBack in the present, Harry realises that the grooms are about to marry the wrong brides. Pasta helps Harry remind Roy and Max of their lives as Bangdu Maharaj and Dharamputra, respectively. Just then, they are introduced to Pappu Rangeela ([[Rana Daggubati]]), a [[qawwali]] singer and a family friend of the girls. He is the reincarnation of Gama but has no recollection of his past life. Meanwhile, Pasta finds a painting of their past lives' wedding day which shows Bala with Madhu, Bangdu with Mala, and Dharamputra with Meena. Before they can show this painting to the girls to remind them of their past lives, it gets in the hands of Pappu Rangeela and he remembers his life as Gama.\n\nPappu crashes the wedding and a fight plays out. The fight makes Pooja and Neha remember everything. Soon, Michael Bhai ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), now revealed to be the reincarnation of Suryabhan, shows up at the wedding for his money and shoots Gama. Kriti remembers everything when she sees Michael Bhai and also tells everyone that the wedding mandap hadn't collapsed on its own - it was broken down by Suryabhan to kill everyone so that he could be King. Michael Bhai recounts his past life and boasts how he got Gama's brother killed. Pappu Rangeela hears this and pushes Michael Bhai into the collapsing mandap, thus getting his revenge.\n\nThe film ends on a happy note with Harry, Roy and Max marrying Kriti, Pooja and Neha, thus competing their 600-year-old love story.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Housefull''===\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Aarush\n* [[Riteish Deshmukh]] as Babu \"Bob\" Rao\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Saundarya \"Sandy\" Bhagayalaxmi Venkateshwari Basapa Rao\n* [[Arjun Rampal]] as Major Krishna Rao\n* [[Lara Dutta]] as Hetal Patel\n* [[Jiah Khan]] as Devika\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Batuk Patel\n* [[Chunkey Pandey]] as Akhri Pasta\n* [[Malaika Arora Khan]] as Pooja\n* [[Randhir Kapoor]] as Kishore Samtani\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as Dhanno (special appearance in song \"Aapka Kya Hoga\")\n* [[Daisy Irani (actress)|Daisy Irani]] as Batuk Patel's mother\n* [[Lillete Dubey]] as Zulekha Bano\n* [[Vindu Dara Singh]] as security guard\n* [[Suresh Menon]] as Santa Singh\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Banta Singh\n\n===''Housefull 2''===\n[[File:With Team of Housefull 2.JPG|thumb|right|Cast and crew of ''Housefull 2'']]\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Sunny K.

The series is produced by [[Sajid Nadiadwala]]. The series stars [[Akshay Kumar]] and [[Ritesh Deshmukh]] as lead cast and [[Boman Irani]] and [[Chunkey Pandey]] in supporting roles as Batuk Patel and Aakhri Pasta respectively. [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] has also appeared in first three films, she however made a special appearance in the first film and played a pivotal role in the second and the third film. Malaika made cameos in the first two movies but didn't appear in the third one. The fourth film, ''[[Housefull 4]]'' featured [[Bobby Deol]], [[Kriti Sanon]], [[Kriti Kharbanda]], [[Pooja Hegde]] and [[Rana Daggubati]] in addition to regular cast. Based on reincarnation theme, it is the most expensive Indian comedy film ever made. [[Farhad Samji]] directed the fourth film.\nEach film starts with a fresh story unrelated with the preceding film's story. However, the theme and the pace remains the same.\n\n==Overview==\n===''Housefull'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Housefull (2010 film)}}\nAarush, ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a jinxed loser who stays with his friend, Bob ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]) and his wife, Hetal ([[Lara Dutta]]), both working at a [[casino]] owned by Mr.Kishore Samtani ([[Randhir Kapoor]]). Although at first Hetal is displeased with Aarush's presence, he proves to be a kind-hearted man looking for family. Bob and Hetal decide to marry him to their boss' daughter, Devika Samtani ([[Jiah Khan]]). After the marriage, on their honeymoon in Italy, Devika leaves him for her long-time American boyfriend Benny. Dejected, Aarush tries to commit suicide by drowning in the sea but is saved by a girl Sandy ([[Deepika Padukone]]).\n\nSandy originally thinks Aarush is a pervert, but when Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), the owner of Italy's biggest hotel where Aarush was spending his honeymoon with Devika, tells Sandy that Aarush is a widower, she befriends him and slowly falls in love with him. What she does not know, is that Aakhri Pasta was only joking. She then finds out his wife is alive and leaves him, but he tells her the whole truth to make her understand and she accepts him.\n\nThe only way Aarush can marry Sandy is by convincing her elder brother, Major Krishna Rao ([[Arjun Rampal]]), a strict Indian Military Intelligence officer who loves and is over-protective of Sandy. Meanwhile, Hetal, in an attempt to reconcile, lies to her father, Batuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]), that Bob owns a mansion and they have a child. The four rent a mansion to make him believe that Bob owns it, but Batuk accidentally believes that Aarush is married to Hetal, and Bob is the cook. Then, Krishna turns up, much to Aarush's horror, leading to more lies.\n\nFor half of the term, the four must pretend that the mansion is owned by Bob, and the rest must pretend that Aarush owns it. An overly suspicious Krishna sees Bob and Hetal working at the casino and uses a lie detector to find the truth. After Sandy objects, Krishna apologises and agrees to Aarush and Sandy's marriage. The whole family is invited to the Royal Palace, to see Krishna get rewarded by the Queen of England. While this is happening, two workers are meant to be installing air conditioning gas for the place, however instead they accidentally supply the hall with laughing gas causing everyone to break into an outburst of laughter. During this laughter, the truth is let out but no one seems to be in the right state of mind.\n\nThe two workers meanwhile stop the gas from spreading \u2013 and its effect passes. Aarush is still telling Krishna the truth, leading Krishna to break off Sandy's engagement. However, after Sandy tearfully pleads with him, Krishna lets the two get married. In the end, Hetal and Bob live together with Batuk Patel, and Aarush's luck changes for the better.\n\n===''Housefull 2'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Housefull 2}}\nThis film is an adaptation of the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film \"Dam Dam Diga Diga\", released in 2008 and Telugu film [[Hungama (2005 film)|Hungama]], released in 2005, which is a remake of Malayalam movie [[Mattupetti Machan]], released in 1998,\nThe two cousins Heena ([[Asin Thottumkal]]) and Bobby ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), daughters of the Kapoor family, hate each other very much. They start quarrelling over something relating to their duties of Animals' Law Authority. Their fathers, Chintu ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) and Dabboo ([[Randhir Kapoor]]), are step-brothers who hate each other to the very core. Even their wives hate each other. Chintu wants the richest son-in law for his daughter, Heena, while Dabboo too wants the same for his daughter, Bobby. Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a marriage counsellor, is ordered by both Chintu and Dabboo to find the best son-in-law. Aakhri Pasta brings Mr. Babani ([[Virendra Saxena]]) to discuss Babani's son Jai.\n\nWhen Chintu misinterprets one of Aakhri's comments, he verbally abuses Babani while shouting. Babani suffers from a condition that affects his heart when he hears loud noises. Due to Chintu's shouting, Babani suffers a heart attack, landing him in a hospital. Babani's son Jai ([[Shreyas Talpade]]) comes to know of this and gets angry, then vows revenge, telling his friend Jolly/Jwala ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]), who is the son of billionaire J.D. ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]), to go to Chintu, agree to marry his daughter and then break off the wedding at the last minute. Jolly is busy trying to introduce his girlfriend to his own father and does not want to get involved. He suggests Max ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), their former college mate and a thief, to do the job. Jay goes with Max as his driver but somehow, they end in the wrong house and go to Dabboo's house.\n\nJay and Max later find out their mistake. Jai, still wanting revenge, doesn't know what to do and Jolly suggests another former sleazy college mate, Sunny ([[Akshay Kumar]]). Jolly goes with Sunny as his bodyguard because Max and Sunny are sworn enemies and as Dabboo's house and Chintu's house are right next to each other, their plan may fail. Sunny and Jolly encounter a crocodile and Max and Jay encounter a snake. They manage to survive the attack.\n\nWhile Heena and Bobby are on a cruise, they accidentally end up on an island. Max and Sunny become friends again, while Heena and Bobby become friends. They find a resort and go home. Dabboo gets Jolly (Max) engaged to Bobby and Chintu gets Jolly (Sunny) engaged to Heena. The day of the engagement, Chintu blindfolds Jolly, Sunny, Jai and Heena and takes them to J.D.'s house. After seeing the real Jolly holding Sunny's garland, J.D. believes that Jolly got engaged to Heena. Luckily, Sunny convinces him. Jolly calls them at midnight and reveals his father's secret of being Jagga Daaku. He also reveals that his real name is Jwala. After Sunny fools Chintu, Chintu calls Dabboo in excitement and tells him that his daughter, Heena, is marrying Jolly, the son of J.D. Confused, and believing Max to be Jolly, Dabboo takes Max and Bobby to J.D.'s mansion. Sunny handles the situation well by fooling J.D. by taking the name of his religion and tells him that Max is Jolly's friend and Bobby is Max's fianc\u00e9 (though actually it is true) and Max's father is against his and Bobby's marriage. J.D. then welcomes Bobby, Max and her family to his house and tells them to stay there up to Bobby and Max's marriage.\n\nBatuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) arrives with his daughter Parul ([[Shazahn Padamsee]]) to make things worse. Jay and Jwala come to receive them from the airport. But when they see Parul, Jay and Jwala lie that Jay is Jolly. Parul becomes happy hearing this as they secretly love each other. Jelo ([[Zarine Khan]]) gives Jwala the ultimatum &nbsp;\u2013 take me to your house or forget me. To help Jwala, Sunny lies to J.D., saying that Jelo is his fianc\u00e9, and J.D. again agrees to let her live there as Sunny takes the name of his religion. Sunny and Max lie to their respective fathers-in-law that the other guy is the son of J.D. and a maid servant in the mansion. This creates a lot of confusion.\n\nWhen Sunny's father as well as Max's 'Guru' tells them never to break anyone's heart, Sunny and Max tell the truth to Heena and Bobby. Enraged, Bobby and Heena slap Max and Sunny respectively and tell them that they never want to see their faces again. But thinking that instead of telling the truth, Sunny and Max could have done more wrong with them, the two sisters pardon the two boys on the very next day. There Jay and Jolly also let off their plan of revenge on Kapoors on Jay's father's advice. Then Henna proposes Sunny in Sunny's style and Bobby proposes Max in Max's style.\n\nOn the day of the four couples' marriage, J.D. and the other brides' fathers learn the truth about the grooms and that they have been lying all this time. Finally Bobby and Heena convince their fathers to forget their enmity and live together as blood brothers. Chintu and Dabboo join hands and so do their wives. But J.D. was not convinced by them telling the truth, so he turns back into Jagga Daku and starts frightening the families with his gun. He tries to shoot Sunny with his gun as Sunny runs towards J.D. to save him from the falling chandelier and then he understands what was happening. In the end, all the grooms marry their respective girlfriends.\n\n===''Housefull 3'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Housefull 3}}\nSix years ago in London, three robbers attempted to steal jewels from a building, but were stopped by the police and arrested. In the present, Batook Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) is a wealthy and successful businessman with three beautiful daughters: Ganga ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), Jamuna ([[Lisa Haydon]]), and Saraswati ([[Nargis Fakhri]]). However, he does not want his daughters to get married, as he claims that all the women in his family are cursed if they get married.\n\nOne night, at a friend's bachelorette party, the girls reveal to their friend that secretly, they each have a boyfriend. Jamuna's boyfriend is Teddy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), who wants to be a racecar driver. Teddy is skilled at racing, but during an important race, his car runs out of gas, and loses. Saraswati's boyfriend is Bunty ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), who wants to be rapper. During a talent competition, the judge claims that his rapping talent is ordinary. Bunty then raps in Hindi swear words at the judge. Unfortunately, the judge knows Hindi, and disqualifies him. Ganga's boyfriend is Sandy ([[Akshay Kumar]]), who wants to be a professional football/soccer player. During tryouts for a team, the coach, who is racist, tells him he cannot join, and calls him a \"Bloody Indian\", which triggers Sandy's evil personality, Sundi, to come out and attack the coach and team. Sandy learns that Sundi comes out whenever he hears the word \"Indian\", and his Dissociative Identity Disorder comes from being depressed about not having enough money to make a living. Sandy sees Batook's success in the paper, and decides to date his doctor, and Batook's daughter, Ganga. When the girls tell their dad that they each have a boyfriend, Batook goes to his friend, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), who owns an Italian restaurant. Batook convinces Pasta to dress up as the family's fortune teller, Aakhri Aasta. Aasta claims that when Ganga's husband first steps foot into Batook's house, Jamuna's husband first sees Batook, or when Saraswati's husband first speaks to Batook, then Batook will have a heart attack, and die. The girls, wanting to keep their boyfriends, have them fake disabilities. Sandy rides around in a motorized wheelchair, and claims he can't use his feet. Teddy wears sunglasses and uses a cane, and claims he is blind. Bunty uses sign language, and claims that he is mute. Batook decides to test the boys to make sure if they are really disabled, by putting ants in Sandy's pants, having Teddy jump in an empty pool, and injuring Bunty to see if he screams. When Batook is out of the house, the boys reveal themselves to each other as not being disabled. Since they all want Batook's money, they decide not to tell on each other, as they each have a recording of the other. At Pasta's restaurant, Batook reveals to Pasta that his daughters are actually the daughters of Urja Nagre ([[Jackie Shroff]]), an underworld crime lord. Nagre was caught when someone informed the police. While in jail, Nagre requested Batook take care of his daughters in London, but make sure that they never found out that Nagre was their father. Batook also reveals that he was the one who informed the police, and did not want the girls to marry until his sons(the robbers in the beginning of the film) got out of prison. Unbeknownst to him, Nagre is out of prison, and has arrived in London.\n\nWhile the girls prepare a wax statue for Batook, the boys go into town, where some gangsters are teasing some girls. Suddenly, Nagre appears, and attack the gangsters. After the gangsters run away, Nagre sees the boys, and ask why did not help. The boys claim that they were disabled. Bunty, who was in the wheelchair at the time, claims he was crippled. Sandy, holding Teddy's cane, claims he is blind, and that Teddy is mute. Later, Nagre goes to Batook's office, and ask him about his daughters's future husbands. Batook says that while the girls' future husbands are disabled, he knows three normal men who are suitable for the daughters. Batook takes Nagre to a Gurdwara to see his sons, Rishi ([[Samir Kochhar]]), Rohan ([[Nikitin Dheer]]), and Rajeev ([[Aarav Chowdhary]]), claiming they are orphans who do community service. Nagre decides that the three are suitable for his daughters.\n\nAt Batook's house, Nagre claims that Batook owes Nagre 5000 crores (50 billion) of British Pounds. Nagre gives Batook and the boys 10 days to make up the money, or Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswati must marry Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev. During these ten days, Nagre and his \"sons\" will also live in Batook's house, meaning that while in front of both Batook and Nagre, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty must act as blind-disabled, mute-blind, and disabled-mute. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty come up with a plan to get rid of Nagre's sons. During a St. Patrick's Day party, the girls get Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev drunk. The next day, they tell each other that they had sex with their respective girls, only to find out that they had sex with the maids. The maids request compensation, or they will sue, of 50 million Pounds. Nagre, learning this, says that the girls will marry the boys of their choosing.\n\nThe next day, the girls take Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty to church, asking for forgiveness. Saraswati, who takes care of disabled children, tells them that two boys were mocking a child because of his disability. The girls feel guilty, because they felt that they were mocking people with disabilities by having the boys act as if they were blind, crippled, and mute. After this, the boys feel guilty, as they were only marrying the girls for money. They go to the warehouse area of Madame Tussauds to meet their girlfriends. They instead find Batook's sons, who explain that they found out the boys were normal. While Teddy and Bunty fight Batook's sons' gang members, Sandy has accidentally heard Teddy say \"Indian\", and Sundi, Sandy's alternate personality, tries to kill Sandy. Batook arrives, and blackmails the boys that Nagre's fortune of 50 million will be divided into 7 parts: Rishi, Rohan, Rajeev, Batook, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty's shares. Sundi says to divide it into 8 shares, as Sandy/Sundi counts as two people. Aakhri Pasta arrives, and demands his share, splitting it into 9 parts. However, the three maids each demand two shares, one for them, and the other for their unborn children they are now carrying. Nagre then arrives, and explains that he found a recording on Bunty's laptop, which revealed that Bunty, Sandy, and Teddy were not disabled. Nagre also overheard Batook, who told his sons that he was responsible for Nagre's imprisonment. Nagre then attempts to kill everyone in the warehouse, while the lights turn on and off. As the girls arrive, Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev see them, and hold them at knifepoint in front of Nagre. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty then rush to save the girls, injuring themselves in the process. As they lay in the girls arms, the boys tell the truth to the girls, and Batook explains how Nagre is their father. The girls forgive the boys, and reconcile with Nagre.\n\n===''Housefull 4'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Housefull 4}}\nHarry ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a barber who frequently gets bizarre flashes of a past era. He runs a barber shop in London with his brothers Roy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Max ([[Bobby Deol]]). The three brothers had misplaced a bag of 5 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] which belonged to gangster Michael Bhai. His henchman Big Bhai ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) constantly demands the money. To fulfil this demand, the three brothers get engaged to the three daughters of London's rich business tycoon Thakral ([[Ranjeet]]): Harry is dating Pooja ([[Pooja Hegde]]), Roy is dating Neha ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]) and Max is dating Kriti ([[Kriti Sanon]]). Mysterious circumstances cause the destination wedding to take place in Sitamgarh, India. On arriving in Sitamgarh, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a bellboy at their hotel, recognises them as reincarnations of people that lived 600 years ago, i.e. in 1419. Harry realises that the flashes he sees have something to do with what Pasta was talking about and drives to the nearby town of [[Madhavgarh]], where he starts to see the flashes clearly.\n\nIn 1419, Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) of Madhavgarh was banished by his father, Maharaj Parikshitap ([[Parikshit Sahni]]), since Bala tried to kill him to become King. Bala's servant Pehla Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]) informs him of Sitamgarh - a nearby kingdom whose King, Maharaj Surya Singh Rana ([[Ranjeet]]), is looking for grooms for his three daughters: Rajkumari Madhu ([[Kriti Sanon]]), Rajkumari Mala ([[Pooja Hegde]]) and Rajkumari Meena ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]). Bala plans to marry Rajkumari Madhu, the eldest Princess, so that he becomes the King of Sitamgarh.\n\nBala meets Bangdu Maharaj ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), an effeminate dance teacher who has an affair with Mala. Meena is secretly in love with the brave bodyguard of the three princesses, Dharamputra ([[Bobby Deol]]). Bala helps the two couples get together and enlists their help for uniting him with Madhu. The plan works and Maharaj Surya Singh Rana announces the wedding of Madhu with Bala, Mala with Bangdu Maharaj, and Meena with Dharamputra. However, Suryabhan ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), Surya Singh Rana's nephew, wants the throne for himself. He kills the brother of Sitamgarh's enemy clan's leader, Gama ([[Rana Daggubati]]) and frames the three couples for it. On the day of the wedding, Gama storms into the fort and fights them to avenge his brother. During the fight, Bala realises that he now truly loves Madhu, even though initially she was just the path to the throne for him. During the fight, the wedding [[Mandapa|mandap]] (altar) collapses and kills the three couples along with Gama.\n\nBack in the present, Harry realises that the grooms are about to marry the wrong brides. Pasta helps Harry remind Roy and Max of their lives as Bangdu Maharaj and Dharamputra, respectively. Just then, they are introduced to Pappu Rangeela ([[Rana Daggubati]]), a [[qawwali]] singer and a family friend of the girls. He is the reincarnation of Gama but has no recollection of his past life. Meanwhile, Pasta finds a painting of their past lives' wedding day which shows Bala with Madhu, Bangdu with Mala, and Dharamputra with Meena. Before they can show this painting to the girls to remind them of their past lives, it gets in the hands of Pappu Rangeela and he remembers his life as Gama.\n\nPappu crashes the wedding and a fight plays out. The fight makes Pooja and Neha remember everything. Soon, Michael Bhai ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), now revealed to be the reincarnation of Suryabhan, shows up at the wedding for his money and shoots Gama. Kriti remembers everything when she sees Michael Bhai and also tells everyone that the wedding mandap hadn't collapsed on its own - it was broken down by Suryabhan to kill everyone so that he could be King. Michael Bhai recounts his past life and boasts how he got Gama's brother killed. Pappu Rangeela hears this and pushes Michael Bhai into the collapsing mandap, thus getting his revenge.\n\nThe film ends on a happy note with Harry, Roy and Max marrying Kriti, Pooja and Neha, thus competing their 600-year-old love story.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Housefull''===\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Aarush\n* [[Riteish Deshmukh]] as Babu \"Bob\" Rao\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Saundarya \"Sandy\" Bhagayalaxmi Venkateshwari Basapa Rao\n* [[Arjun Rampal]] as Major Krishna Rao\n* [[Lara Dutta]] as Hetal Patel\n* [[Jiah Khan]] as Devika\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Batuk Patel\n* [[Chunkey Pandey]] as Akhri Pasta\n* [[Malaika Arora Khan]] as Pooja\n* [[Randhir Kapoor]] as Kishore Samtani\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as Dhanno (special appearance in song \"Aapka Kya Hoga\")\n* [[Daisy Irani (actress)|Daisy Irani]] as Batuk Patel's mother\n* [[Lillete Dubey]] as Zulekha Bano\n* [[Vindu Dara Singh]] as security guard\n* [[Suresh Menon]] as Santa Singh\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Banta Singh\n\n===''Housefull 2''===\n[[File:With Team of Housefull 2.JPG|thumb|right|Cast and crew of ''Housefull 2'']]\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Sunny K.

The series was supposed to start on March 21 in Kenora, but Montreal protested the use of Smith and Westwick, and also wanted to play the series in Winnipeg. Foran ruled that both players were ineligible. The clubs went ahead and started the series on March 23 in Winnipeg. Mr. Foran was notified by the press (inaccurately) that Montreal had dropped its protest and that the clubs intended to play anyway. Mr. Foran threatened to take the Cup back to Ottawa:\n\n<blockquote>\nIf the two clubs ignore the instructions of the cup trustees by mutually agreeing to play against Westwick and Smith when both were positively informed these men were ineligible to participate in the present cup matches, the series will be treated as void, and the cup will be taken charge of by the trustees. It will remain in their possession till the various hockey leagues can educate themselves up to a standard where decent sport will be the order of the day.\u201d<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=March 25, 1907 |title=Never Too Late to Mend |pages=9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe teams went ahead and played the series.

The series was supposed to start on March 21 in Kenora, but Montreal protested the use of Smith and Westwick, and also wanted to play the series in Winnipeg. Foran ruled that both players were ineligible. The clubs went ahead and started the series on March 23 in Winnipeg. Mr. Foran was notified by the press (inaccurately) that Montreal had dropped its protest and that the clubs intended to play anyway. Mr. Foran threatened to take the Cup back to Ottawa:\n\n<blockquote>\nIf the two clubs ignore the instructions of the cup trustees by mutually agreeing to play against Westwick and Smith when both were positively informed these men were ineligible to participate in the present cup matches, the series will be treated as void, and the cup will be taken charge of by the trustees. It will remain in their possession till the various hockey leagues can educate themselves up to a standard where decent sport will be the order of the day.\u201d<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=March 25, 1907 |title=Never Too Late to Mend |pages=9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe teams went ahead and played the series.

Faghani has refereed important matches such as the [[2014 AFC Champions League Final]], the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup Final]], the [[2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final]] , the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament \u2013 Knockout stage|2016 Olympic football final match]]. He has refereed matches in the [[2017 Liga 1]] , [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia and the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]]. Alireza migrated to Australia in September 2019.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on 21 March 1978 in [[Kashmar]], a city near [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]]. His nickname is ''Behrooz'' ({{lang|fa|\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0648\u0632}}). His father, Mohammad Faghani ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}) was also a football referee.\n\nFaghani was part of the youth team of [[Bank Melli F.C.|Bank Melli]], and also played for Shahab Khodro, [[Etka Gorgan F.C.|Etka]], and [[Niroye Zamini F.C.|Niroye Zamini]]. He also played in Iran's [[League 2 (Iran)|League 2]] which is the third tier in the Iranian football pyramid. However, in the end he decided to be a football referee.\n\n==Refereeing career==\nFaghani became a [[FIFA]] referee in 2008, only a year after officiating in the top flight league in Iran.
