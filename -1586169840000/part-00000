[[Fourier analysis]] converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the [[frequency domain]] and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by [[Matrix decomposition|factorizing]] the [[DFT matrix]] into a product of [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] (mostly zero) factors.<ref name=\"Loan_1992\"/> As a result, it manages to reduce the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computing the DFT from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math>, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to <math>O(N \\log N)</math>, where <math>N</math> is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]].\n\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for [[discrete Fourier transform#Applications|applications]] in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> In 1994, [[Gilbert Strang]] described the FFT as \"the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime\",<ref name=\"Strang_1994\"/><ref name=\"Kent_2002\"/> and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the [[IEEE]] magazine ''Computing in Science & Engineering''.<ref name=\"Dongarra_Sullivan_2000\"/>\n\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with [[Big O notation|O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')]] [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;''N''. Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-2\\pi i/N}</math> is an ''N''-th [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] and [[3 Juno|Juno]] from sample observations.<ref name=\"Gauss_1866\"/><ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1985\"/> His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by [[James Cooley]] and [[John Tukey]], who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even [[Joseph Fourier]]'s results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. [[Frank Yates]] in 1932 published his version called ''interaction algorithm'', which provided efficient computation of [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard and Walsh transforms]].<ref name=\"Yates_1937\"/> Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, [[G. C. Danielson]] and [[Cornelius Lanczos]] published their version to compute DFT for [[x-ray crystallography]], a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.<ref name=\"Danielson_Lanczos_1942\"/><ref name=\"Lanczos_1956\"/> While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get <math>O(N \\log N)</math> runtime.<ref name=\"Cooley_Lewis_Welch_1967\"/>\n\nJames Cooley and John Tukey published a [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm|more general version of FFT]] in 1965 that is applicable when ''N'' is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of [[President Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, an FFT algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, [[Richard Garwin]] recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.<ref name=\"Cooley_1987\"/> Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|IBM's Watson labs]]) for implementation.<ref name=\"Garwin_1969\"/> Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/> As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> be [[complex number]]s. The [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] is defined by the formula\n\n:<math> X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi k n/N} \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,N-1, </math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i 2\\pi/N}</math> is a [[Primitive root of unity|primitive]] {{mvar|N}}th root of 1.\n\nEvaluating this definition directly requires <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> operations. All known FFT algorithms require [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|\u0398]]<math>(N \\log N)</math> operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/>\n\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''<sup>2</sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N'' \u2212 1) complex additions, of which <math>O(N)</math> operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. On the other hand, the radix-2 [[#Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm|Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005),<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> but the overall improvement from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> to <math>O(N \\log N)</math> remains.\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm===\n{{main|Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm}}\n\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/>).\n\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965,<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> but it was later discovered<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805<ref name=\"Gauss_1805\"/> (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\n\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/>). These are called the ''radix-2'' and ''mixed-radix'' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\n\n===Other FFT algorithms===\n{{main|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm|Hexagonal fast Fourier transform}}\n\nThere are FFT algorithms other than Cooley\u2013Tukey. [[Cornelius Lanczos]] did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS ([[fast Fourier sampling]] method) with [[G. C. Danielson]] (1940).{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nFor ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976)<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''N''. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''z''<sup>2''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''az''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm,<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/><ref name=\"Winograd_1979\"/> which factorizes ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.\n\n[[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''N'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N'' \u2212 1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]] (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\n\n: <math>nk = -\\frac{(k-n)^2} 2 + \\frac{n^2} 2 + \\frac{k^2} 2.</math>\n\n[[Hexagonal fast Fourier transform]] aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\n\n==FFT algorithms specialized for real or symmetric data==\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\n\n:<math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*</math>\n\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/><ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_2\"/> One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.\n\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs.<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/> Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\n\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]]/[[discrete sine transform|sine transform(s)]] ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre- and post-processing.\n\n==Computational issues==\n\n===Bounds on complexity and operation counts===\n{{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than <math>O(N\\log N)</math>?}}\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') (i.e., order ''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'' or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.\n\nFollowing work by [[Shmuel Winograd]] (1978),<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/> a tight \u0398(''N'') lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only <math>4N - 2\\log_2^2(N) - 2\\log_2(N) - 4</math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length <math>N = 2^m</math>. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1986;<ref name=\"Heideman_Burrus_1986\"/> Duhamel, 1990<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/>). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990;<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/> Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/>\n\nA tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern<ref name=\"Morgenstern_1973\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of <math>\\sqrt N</math>), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix)  under the same scaling. [[Victor Pan|Pan]] (1986)<ref name=\"Pan_1986\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ''N'', [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] (1979)<ref name=\"Papadimitriou_1979\"/> argued that the number <math>N \\log_2 N</math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least <math>2N \\log_2 N</math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than <math>N \\log_2 N</math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires <math>4N\\log_2(N) - 6N + 8</math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1. This was recently reduced to <math>\\sim \\frac{34}{9} N \\log_2 N</math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007;<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/> Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007<ref name=\"Lundy_Buskirk_2007\"/>). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N'' \u2265 256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N'' \u2264 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal & Haynal, 2011).<ref name=\"Haynal_2011\"/>\n\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990).<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/>\n\n===Approximations===\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999)<ref name=\"Edelman_McCorquodale_Toledo_1999\"/> achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]]. A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996)<ref name=\"Guo_Burrus_1996\"/> takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).<ref name=\"Shentov_Mitra_Heute_Hossen_1995\"/> The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''{{nnbsp}}log(''N''){{nnbsp}}log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ''N''/''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;32 in a large-''N'' example (''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>22</sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).<ref name=\"Hassanieh_2012\"/>\n\n===Accuracy===\nEven the \"exact\" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(''\u03b5'' log ''N''), compared to O(''\u03b5N''<sup>3/2</sup>) for the na\u00efve DFT formula,<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/> where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|log ''N''}}) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|''N''}}) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).<ref name=\"Schatzman_1996\"/> These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\n\nIn [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O({{radic|''N''}}) for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).<ref name=\"Welch_1969\"/> Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).<ref name=\"Erg\u00fcn_1995\"/>\n\n==Multidimensional FFTs==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nAs defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=0}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\ntransforms an array ''x''<sub>'''n'''</sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices <math>\\mathbf{n} = \\left(n_1, \\ldots, n_d\\right)</math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over <math>n_j = 0 \\ldots N_j - 1</math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = \\left(n_1/N_1, \\ldots, n_d/N_d\\right)</math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\n\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> dimension, then along the ''n''<sub>2</sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity, where <math>N = N_1 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot N_d</math> is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are ''N''/''N''<sub>1</sub> transforms of size ''N''<sub>1</sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      & \\frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \\log N_1) + \\cdots + \\frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \\log N_d) \\\\[6pt]\n  ={} & O\\left(N \\left[\\log N_1 + \\cdots + \\log N_d\\right]\\right) = O(N \\log N).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn two dimensions, the ''x''<sub>'''k'''</sub> can be viewed as an <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\n\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> direction. More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups <math>(n_1, \\ldots, n_{d/2})</math> and <math>(n_{d/2+1}, \\ldots, n_d)</math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\right)</math> of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(1, \\ldots, 1, r, 1, \\ldots, 1\\right)</math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977),<ref name=\"Nussbaumer_1977\"/> which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990)<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/> for more information and references.\n\n==Other generalizations==\nAn O(''N''<sup>5/2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> with ''N''<sup>2</sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp,<ref name=\"Mohlenkamp_1999\"/> along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library.<ref name=\"libftsh\"/> A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''<sup>2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.<ref name=\"Rokhlin_Tygert_2006\"/>\n\nThe [[fast folding algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\n\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=\"Potts_Steidl_Tasche_2001\"/> Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of [[spectral estimation]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe FFT is used in digital recording, sampling, [[additive synthesis]] and [[pitch correction]] software.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Richard James |title=The History of Music Production |date=2014 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199357178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe FFT's importance derives from the fact that it has made working in the frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in the temporal or spatial domain. Some of the important applications of the FFT include:<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/><ref name=\"Chu_George_1999\"/>\n* Fast large-integer and polynomial multiplication\n* Efficient matrix-vector multiplication for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz]], [[Circulant matrix|circulant]] and other structured matrices\n* Filtering algorithms (see [[Overlap-add method|overlap-add]] and [[Overlap-save method|overlap-save]] methods)\n* Fast algorithms for [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]] or [[discrete sine transform|sine transforms]] (e.g. [[Discrete cosine transform|fast DCT]] used for [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]]/[[MP3]] encoding and decoding)\n* Fast [[Chebyshev approximation]]\n* Solving [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]]s\n* Computation of [[Mass spectrometry|isotopic distributions]].<ref name=\"Fernandez-de-Cossio_2012\"/>\n\n==Research areas==\n; Big FFTs: With the explosion of big data in fields such as astronomy, the need for 512k FFTs has arisen for certain interferometry calculations. The data collected by projects such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[LIGO]] require FFTs of tens of billions of points. As this size does not fit into main memory, so called out-of-core FFTs are an active area of research.<ref name=\"Cormen_Nicol_1998\"/>\n; Approximate FFTs: For applications such as MRI, it is necessary to compute DFTs for nonuniformly spaced grid points and/or frequencies. Multipole based approaches can compute approximate quantities with factor of runtime increase.<ref name=\"Dutt_Rokhlin_1993\"/>\n; [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Group FFTs]]: The FFT may also be explained and interpreted using [[Group representation|group representation theory]] that allows for further generalization. A function on any compact group, including non cyclic, has an expansion in terms of a basis of irreducible matrix elements. It remains active area of research to find efficient algorithm for performing this change of basis. Applications including efficient [[spherical harmonics|spherical harmonic]] expansion, analyzing certain [[Markov process]]es, robotics etc.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2004\"/>\n; [[Quantum Fourier transform|Quantum FFTs]]: Shor's fast algorithm for [[integer factorization]] on a quantum computer has a subroutine to compute DFT of a binary vector. This is implemented as sequence of 1- or 2-bit quantum gates now known as quantum FFT, which is effectively the Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT realized as a particular factorization of the Fourier matrix. Extension to these ideas is currently being explored.\n\n==Language reference==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!Command/Method\n!Pre-requisites\n|-\n|[[R (programming

[[Fourier analysis]] converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the [[frequency domain]] and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by [[Matrix decomposition|factorizing]] the [[DFT matrix]] into a product of [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] (mostly zero) factors.<ref name=\"Loan_1992\"/> As a result, it manages to reduce the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computing the DFT from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math>, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to <math>O(N \\log N)</math>, where <math>N</math> is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]].\n\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for [[discrete Fourier transform#Applications|applications]] in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> In 1994, [[Gilbert Strang]] described the FFT as \"the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime\",<ref name=\"Strang_1994\"/><ref name=\"Kent_2002\"/> and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the [[IEEE]] magazine ''Computing in Science & Engineering''.<ref name=\"Dongarra_Sullivan_2000\"/>\n\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with [[Big O notation|O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')]] [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;''N''. Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-2\\pi i/N}</math> is an ''N''-th [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] and [[3 Juno|Juno]] from sample observations.<ref name=\"Gauss_1866\"/><ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1985\"/> His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by [[James Cooley]] and [[John Tukey]], who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even [[Joseph Fourier]]'s results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. [[Frank Yates]] in 1932 published his version called ''interaction algorithm'', which provided efficient computation of [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard and Walsh transforms]].<ref name=\"Yates_1937\"/> Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, [[G. C. Danielson]] and [[Cornelius Lanczos]] published their version to compute DFT for [[x-ray crystallography]], a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.<ref name=\"Danielson_Lanczos_1942\"/><ref name=\"Lanczos_1956\"/> While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get <math>O(N \\log N)</math> runtime.<ref name=\"Cooley_Lewis_Welch_1967\"/>\n\nJames Cooley and John Tukey published a [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm|more general version of FFT]] in 1965 that is applicable when ''N'' is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of [[President Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, an FFT algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, [[Richard Garwin]] recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.<ref name=\"Cooley_1987\"/> Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|IBM's Watson labs]]) for implementation.<ref name=\"Garwin_1969\"/> Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/> As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> be [[complex number]]s. The [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] is defined by the formula\n\n:<math> X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi k n/N} \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,N-1, </math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i 2\\pi/N}</math> is a [[Primitive root of unity|primitive]] {{mvar|N}}th root of 1.\n\nEvaluating this definition directly requires <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> operations. All known FFT algorithms require [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|\u0398]]<math>(N \\log N)</math> operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/>\n\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''<sup>2</sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N'' \u2212 1) complex additions, of which <math>O(N)</math> operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. On the other hand, the radix-2 [[#Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm|Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005),<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> but the overall improvement from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> to <math>O(N \\log N)</math> remains.\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm===\n{{main|Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm}}\n\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/>).\n\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965,<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> but it was later discovered<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805<ref name=\"Gauss_1805\"/> (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\n\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/>). These are called the ''radix-2'' and ''mixed-radix'' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\n\n===Other FFT algorithms===\n{{main|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm|Hexagonal fast Fourier transform}}\n\nThere are FFT algorithms other than Cooley\u2013Tukey. [[Cornelius Lanczos]] did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS ([[fast Fourier sampling]] method) with [[G. C. Danielson]] (1940).{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nFor ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976)<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''N''. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''z''<sup>2''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''az''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm,<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/><ref name=\"Winograd_1979\"/> which factorizes ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.\n\n[[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''N'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N'' \u2212 1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]] (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\n\n: <math>nk = -\\frac{(k-n)^2} 2 + \\frac{n^2} 2 + \\frac{k^2} 2.</math>\n\n[[Hexagonal fast Fourier transform]] aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\n\n==FFT algorithms specialized for real or symmetric data==\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\n\n:<math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*</math>\n\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/><ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_2\"/> One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.\n\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs.<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/> Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\n\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]]/[[discrete sine transform|sine transform(s)]] ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre- and post-processing.\n\n==Computational issues==\n\n===Bounds on complexity and operation counts===\n{{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than <math>O(N\\log N)</math>?}}\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') (i.e., order ''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'' or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.\n\nFollowing work by [[Shmuel Winograd]] (1978),<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/> a tight \u0398(''N'') lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only <math>4N - 2\\log_2^2(N) - 2\\log_2(N) - 4</math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length <math>N = 2^m</math>. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1986;<ref name=\"Heideman_Burrus_1986\"/> Duhamel, 1990<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/>). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990;<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/> Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/>\n\nA tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern<ref name=\"Morgenstern_1973\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of <math>\\sqrt N</math>), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix)  under the same scaling. [[Victor Pan|Pan]] (1986)<ref name=\"Pan_1986\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ''N'', [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] (1979)<ref name=\"Papadimitriou_1979\"/> argued that the number <math>N \\log_2 N</math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least <math>2N \\log_2 N</math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than <math>N \\log_2 N</math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires <math>4N\\log_2(N) - 6N + 8</math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1. This was recently reduced to <math>\\sim \\frac{34}{9} N \\log_2 N</math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007;<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/> Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007<ref name=\"Lundy_Buskirk_2007\"/>). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N'' \u2265 256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N'' \u2264 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal & Haynal, 2011).<ref name=\"Haynal_2011\"/>\n\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990).<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/>\n\n===Approximations===\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999)<ref name=\"Edelman_McCorquodale_Toledo_1999\"/> achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]]. A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996)<ref name=\"Guo_Burrus_1996\"/> takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).<ref name=\"Shentov_Mitra_Heute_Hossen_1995\"/> The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''{{nnbsp}}log(''N''){{nnbsp}}log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ''N''/''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;32 in a large-''N'' example (''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>22</sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).<ref name=\"Hassanieh_2012\"/>\n\n===Accuracy===\nEven the \"exact\" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(''\u03b5'' log ''N''), compared to O(''\u03b5N''<sup>3/2</sup>) for the na\u00efve DFT formula,<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/> where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|log ''N''}}) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|''N''}}) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).<ref name=\"Schatzman_1996\"/> These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\n\nIn [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O({{radic|''N''}}) for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).<ref name=\"Welch_1969\"/> Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).<ref name=\"Erg\u00fcn_1995\"/>\n\n==Multidimensional FFTs==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nAs defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=0}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\ntransforms an array ''x''<sub>'''n'''</sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices <math>\\mathbf{n} = \\left(n_1, \\ldots, n_d\\right)</math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over <math>n_j = 0 \\ldots N_j - 1</math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = \\left(n_1/N_1, \\ldots, n_d/N_d\\right)</math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\n\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> dimension, then along the ''n''<sub>2</sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity, where <math>N = N_1 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot N_d</math> is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are ''N''/''N''<sub>1</sub> transforms of size ''N''<sub>1</sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      & \\frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \\log N_1) + \\cdots + \\frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \\log N_d) \\\\[6pt]\n  ={} & O\\left(N \\left[\\log N_1 + \\cdots + \\log N_d\\right]\\right) = O(N \\log N).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn two dimensions, the ''x''<sub>'''k'''</sub> can be viewed as an <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\n\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> direction. More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups <math>(n_1, \\ldots, n_{d/2})</math> and <math>(n_{d/2+1}, \\ldots, n_d)</math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\right)</math> of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(1, \\ldots, 1, r, 1, \\ldots, 1\\right)</math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977),<ref name=\"Nussbaumer_1977\"/> which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990)<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/> for more information and references.\n\n==Other generalizations==\nAn O(''N''<sup>5/2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> with ''N''<sup>2</sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp,<ref name=\"Mohlenkamp_1999\"/> along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library.<ref name=\"libftsh\"/> A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''<sup>2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.<ref name=\"Rokhlin_Tygert_2006\"/>\n\nThe [[fast folding algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\n\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=\"Potts_Steidl_Tasche_2001\"/> Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of [[spectral estimation]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe FFT is used in digital recording, sampling, [[additive synthesis]] and [[pitch correction]] software.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Richard James |title=The History of Music Production |date=2014 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199357178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe FFT's importance derives from the fact that it has made working in the frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in the temporal or spatial domain.

The data collected by projects such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[LIGO]] require FFTs of tens of billions of points. As this size does not fit into main memory, so called out-of-core FFTs are an active area of research.<ref name=\"Cormen_Nicol_1998\"/>\n; Approximate FFTs: For applications such as MRI, it is necessary to compute DFTs for nonuniformly spaced grid points and/or frequencies.

Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.\n\n==Derech Eretz==\nThe phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): \"Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''Derech Eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin\". The term ''Derech Eretz'', literally \"the way of the land\", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}.</ref>\n\n===Appropriate behaviour and good character===\n{{see|Proper behavior precedes the Torah}}\n[[Image:Virtue.

The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.\n\n==Derech Eretz==\nThe phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): \"Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''Derech Eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin\". The term ''Derech Eretz'', literally \"the way of the land\", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}.</ref>\n\n===Appropriate behaviour and good character===\n{{see|Proper behavior precedes the Torah}}\n[[Image:Virtue. La Vertu (NYPL b14140320-1638489).jpg|thumb|200px|Personification of virtue - one aspect of ''Derech Eretz.'']]\nIn the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], there are approximately 200 teachings concerning ''Derech Eretz'' as decent, polite, respectful, thoughtful, and civilized behavior.<ref>{{citation | first = Jeff | last = Forsythe | url = http://www.shemayisrael.com/rabbiforsythe/interpersonal/derecheretz.htm | title = Derech Eretz: Civil, Polite and Thoughtful Behavior | publisher = Shema Yisrael}}.</ref> One representative teaching is that ''\"Derech Eretz comes before Torah\"'' (\u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05e7\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u05dc\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 ''[[Midrash#Midrash Rabbah|Midrash Vayikra Rabbah]]'' 9:3) \u2013 one cannot personify Torah until he demonstrates ''Derech Eretz'' in everything that he does. \n\nThere are many more such teachings in the [[rishonim]] and [[acharonim]] (post-Talmudic authorities). The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

Thus, as formulated in ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'' [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2032/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm 4:1]:\n{{quote|Who is rich? One who is satisfied with his lot.

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\".

Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

It was created and run by its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Norman Osborn]]. Norman studied chemistry and electrical engineering in college. He also took a number of courses in business administration. Norman Osborn's teacher, Professor [[Mendel Stromm]], formed the business partnership. Since Norman put up the bulk of the financing, they called their company the Osborn Corporation, or Oscorp.\n\nStromm's early research was on a chemical that would provide enhanced strength in its test subjects and would eventually turn Osborn into the [[Green Goblin]]. Osborn, wanting the formula for himself, discovered that Stromm had been embezzling funds from Oscorp. Stromm explained that he was merely borrowing but Osborn turned him over to the police.

Norman invented the technology which would create the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] and hired him to assassinate Kingpin. The assassination was foiled by Peter Parker and the Kingpin suspected a conspiracy against him. Norman subsequently fired the Hobgoblin, who allied with Kingpin and kidnapped Norman's son Harry. When the Kingpin refused to pay Hobgoblin immediately, they ceased their partnership. Following this, Osborn sold 50% of his company to the Kingpin in order to repay his debt. Norman and his partner Wardell Stromm were forced into creating chemical weapons for the Kingpin.

Osborn tried to recreate the chemical (secretly) and used small doses of it. The formula indeed increased his intelligence and strength, but it also drove him insane.

It was created and run by its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Norman Osborn]]. Norman studied chemistry and electrical engineering in college. He also took a number of courses in business administration. Norman Osborn's teacher, Professor [[Mendel Stromm]], formed the business partnership. Since Norman put up the bulk of the financing, they called their company the Osborn Corporation, or Oscorp.\n\nStromm's early research was on a chemical that would provide enhanced strength in its test subjects and would eventually turn Osborn into the [[Green Goblin]]. Osborn, wanting the formula for himself, discovered that Stromm had been embezzling funds from Oscorp. Stromm explained that he was merely borrowing but Osborn turned him over to the police. After several years in prison, Stromm was released and tried to kill Osborn for revenge using evil robots.

Oscorp is responsible for the creation of [[Mister Negative]] and eventually Otto's quitting from the company at the same time by the said incident, and has committed several safety and ethical violations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alchemax]]\n* [[Cross Technological Enterprises]]\n* [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]\n* [[Parker Industries]]\n* [[Stark Industries]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.wikia.com/Parker_Industries_(Earth-616) Oscorp] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/osborn-industries/4060-58700/ Oscorp] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Goblin (Marvel Comics)}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n[[Category:1966 in comics]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man]]\n", "name_user": "117.200.30.7", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(MARVEL)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscorp"}
