Also available in Italy, but marketed as \"Fonzies\". It was launched in 1950 by the General Foods Corporation. The brand name is owned by [[The Smith's Snackfood Company]]. While originally an Australian-owned company, Smith's was acquired in August 1998 by [[Frito-Lay]], the second largest producer of snack foods in Australia, which in turn is owned by American multi-national [[PepsiCo]]. In Malaysia, Twisties is a product of [[Mondel\u0113z International]], after having been a part of [[Danone]] and later, [[Kraft Foods]] previously. In Thailand, the Twisties trademark is owned by [[Lay's]], which like The Smith's Snackfood Company, is owned by PepsiCo.\n\n==History ==\nIn the early 1950s Melbourne businessman Isador Magid imported a [[Food extrusion|rotary head extruder]] from the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Gina Rushton |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/ben-pasternak-15-tops-app-charts-now-for-a-startup/news-story/b4f2be8f197caf983c921019d881e54b |title=Ben Pasternak, 15, tops app charts, now for a start-up |work=The Australian |date= October 9, 2014|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}</ref> which initially did not work. After bringing out a technical expert from the USA as well as receiving valuable advice from the CSIRO, Magid started producing Twisties. The product was popular but large scale distribution was difficult so Magid decided to sell the machine and the brand in 1955 to Monty Lea from [[Darrell Lea]] for \u00a312,000.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=6 April 1990|title=Isador Magid|url=|journal=BRW|volume=|pages=83|via=}}</ref>  Monty and his brother Harris experimented with the machine further using rice and various flavourings. Twisties became popular in Australia - some of its early success is attributed to promotional activity that included advertising the product on [[Graham Kennedy]] and [[Bert Newton]]'s TV show [[In Melbourne Tonight]], making it one of the earliest products advertised on that program.  After an unsuccessful attempt to launch Twisties in the UK and competition for shelf space in Australia the Lea brothers agreed to sell the Twisties brand to the Smith's Snackfood Company.\n\nDuring the late 1990s the Twisties brand went through a brand overhaul, coinciding with the acquisition of The Smith's Snackfood Company by Frito-Lay. During the brand overhaul the appearance of the packet was changed to a more modernised look, adopting its current logo. As well as this, the texture of the snack itself was altered, resulting in a smoother finish.\n\nTwisties were originally available only in '[[Cheese]]' flavour, but '[[Chicken]]' and 'Wicked Cheddar Zig-Zag' flavours were later introduced and became a standard part of the product line. There have also been flavours abroad as diverse as 'Toffee', 'Tomato', 'Salmon Teriyaki' and 'Peri Peri',  where the local palate suits them the most.\n\nTwisties are eaten as a snack in themselves, or sometimes in a sandwich as a \"Twistie buttie\" or \"Twisties roll\", by serving the packet contents between two slices of buttered bread or in a roll.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The cut and thrust of tuckshop tactics|last=Squires|first=Tony|date=26 August 1994|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Regional recipes add flavour to tucker tour of Australia|last=Dale|first=David|date=22 June 2008|work=Sun Herald|access-date=|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Bowled over|last=Preston|first=Matt|date=8 June 2010|work=The Courier-Mail|access-date=|page=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a Twisties batch was recalled after reports of consumers finding pieces of fine wire in packs, there were no reports of injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=In brief local|last=|first=|date=3 May 1997|work=The Age|access-date=|page=3}}</ref> The company thought that the wire resulted from machinery malfunction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Pins in soft toys work of 'maniac'|last=Honeysett|first=Stuart|date=3 May 1997|work=The Australian|access-date=|page=3}}</ref> In 2014, Twisties were one of the products removed from shops in Malaysia due to concerns around contamination from pork products.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=T|date=2015|title=Cadbury and pig DNA: when issue management intersects with religion|url=https://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/eserv/rmit:33957/n2006056309.pdf|journal=Corporate Communications|volume=20|issue=4|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Frito-Lay lost a trademark dispute with [[Aldi|Aldi Stores]], as Aldi's 'Chazoos' cheese twists were not considered to infringe on the registered trademark of Twisties on the basis of packaging, extrusion production or the sound of the product name.

Other base ingredients standard in every flavour are [[vegetable oil]], [[whey protein]], [[salt]], and [[monosodium glutamate]] (E621) as a flavour enhancer. Ingredients differ depending on the variety of Twisties.\n\nWendyl Nissen's review of packaged food noted that Twisties are a bit better than other super market snacks because the cheese flavouring is sourced from milk solids rather than chemical flavourings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A few twists in a cheesy old favourite Twisties $2.98 - 150gms|last=Nissen|first=Wendyl|date=4 September 2010|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the Herald Sun highlighted that Twisties contain not only MSG itself, but also HVP (hydrolysed vegetable protein) which is a source of MSG.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=What's in...

When the liquid mixture is passed through a hole between a spinning plate and a stationary plate, it expands, cools and solidifies to make characteristic knobbly surfaced, squiggly Twisties.

This could be attributed to Twisties' success.\n\nAdvertising for the snack has almost completely stopped in the last decade in comparison to its past promotions. Twisties' largest (and most expensive) campaign ever was between 1982-1983 with its \"Twisties jumper\" campaign. Lillian Darrell, a previously unknown actor, played the role of an old woman knitting a Twisties jumper straight from a sheep. The promotion included free knitting patterns and free bags of Twisties. Other promotions were attempted afterwards, but they resulted in little success. Currently, Twisties relies heavily on limited edition flavours to keep hype on a profitable level.\n\nIn 1986, [[Fred Nile]] complained about a Twisties television commercial to the Advertising Standards Council.

The packet features a penguin mascot about to throw a cheese curl as if it were a ball, and has a completely different slogan as compared to its Australian counterpart: it being \"It's a straight world without Twisties!\" They are less dense than the Australian variety, and their shape is more tubular and curvy without imperfections in the shape (Australian Twisties are more jagged and detailed). In New Zealand the Australian variety is not widely available.\n\n[[Image:fonzies.jpg|thumb|150px|A packet of Fonzies]]\nTwisties are also sold on the Italian market with the name 'Fonzies'.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Business Review Weekly: BRW|year=1991|volume=13|issue=26\u201334|page=43|quote=[...] in Europe, Twisties are sold under the Fonzies brand [...]}}</ref>  Fonzies are pale yellow in colour, because they do not use the bright orange food colouring that normal Twisties use. Their cheese flavouring is very similar to that used in the Oceanian varieties bearing the 'Twisties' name, lighter and less prone to clump together during consumption, and with a more natural cheese flavour. The only quality that differentiates it from said varieties is its slight egg-like taste upon first bite, though it wears away after continued consumption. It is made through the same rotary head extrusion technique as in all other localisations, though the snacks are much smaller than those found in Australia, sticking more to a general thin shape rather than a selection of both thin and stout snacks. Its smell is much more pungent, as well. Fonzies are available in 'Gli Originali' ('Original') flavour, as well as 'Time Out', 'Choco', 'Hot Passion', 'Bacon', 'Hot Chili' and others.\n\n*The ingredients for Fonzies are as follows, in order of percentage of product: corn grit 62.2%, palm oil, cheese powder 6%, whey powder, salt, flavour, baking powder, yeast extract, flavour enhancers (E621, E627, E631), lactose (from milk), smoke flavour.\n\nAlthough sold in Italy, Fonzies are produced in Germany by LU Snack Foods GmbH. In the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC countries]], they are also sold with the name 'Fonzies', produced by Kraft Malaysia.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.smiths.com.au/brands/twisties Twisties page by Smith's Snackfoods]\n\n{{PepsiCo}}\n\n[[Category:Australian snack foods]]\n[[Category:Brand name snack foods]]\n[[Category:The Smith's Snackfood Company brands]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Australian snack food|the Maltese snack food|Twistees|the fastening twist tie|Twist tie}}\n{{infobox brand\n| name           = Twisties\n| image          = [[File:Twisties logo.png|200px]]\n| caption        = The present Twisties logo\n| type           = [[Cheese curl]]\n| currentowner   = [[The Smith's Snackfood Company]]\n| origin         =\n| introduced     = {{Start date and age|1950}}\n| discontinued   =\n| related        = \n| markets        = Oceania\n| previousowners = Australia:<br>Twistie Corporation<br>[[Darrell Lea]]<br>[[General Foods Corporation]]<br>Malaysia:<br>[[Danone]]<br>[[Kraft Foods]]\n| trademarkregistrations = [[The Smith's Snackfood Company]] (Australia)<br>Twisties<br>[[Mondel\u0113z International]] (Malaysia)<br>Twisties<br>[[Lay's]] (Thailand)<br>Twisty  ('\u0e17\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e35\u0e49' in [[Thai language|Thai]])\n| ambassador     =\n| tagline        = Life's pretty straight without...

Also available in Italy, but marketed as \"Fonzies\". It was launched in 1950 by the General Foods Corporation. The brand name is owned by [[The Smith's Snackfood Company]]. While originally an Australian-owned company, Smith's was acquired in August 1998 by [[Frito-Lay]], the second largest producer of snack foods in Australia, which in turn is owned by American multi-national [[PepsiCo]]. In Malaysia, Twisties is a product of [[Mondel\u0113z International]], after having been a part of [[Danone]] and later, [[Kraft Foods]] previously. In Thailand, the Twisties trademark is owned by [[Lay's]], which like The Smith's Snackfood Company, is owned by PepsiCo.\n\n==History ==\nIn the early 1950s Melbourne businessman Isador Magid imported a [[Food extrusion|rotary head extruder]] from the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Gina Rushton |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/ben-pasternak-15-tops-app-charts-now-for-a-startup/news-story/b4f2be8f197caf983c921019d881e54b |title=Ben Pasternak, 15, tops app charts, now for a start-up |work=The Australian |date= October 9, 2014|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}</ref> which initially did not work. After bringing out a technical expert from the USA as well as receiving valuable advice from the CSIRO, Magid started producing Twisties. The product was popular but large scale distribution was difficult so Magid decided to sell the machine and the brand in 1955 to Monty Lea from [[Darrell Lea]] for \u00a312,000.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=6 April 1990|title=Isador Magid|url=|journal=BRW|volume=|pages=83|via=}}</ref>  Monty and his brother Harris experimented with the machine further using rice and various flavourings. Twisties became popular in Australia - some of its early success is attributed to promotional activity that included advertising the product on [[Graham Kennedy]] and [[Bert Newton]]'s TV show [[In Melbourne Tonight]], making it one of the earliest products advertised on that program.  After an unsuccessful attempt to launch Twisties in the UK and competition for shelf space in Australia the Lea brothers agreed to sell the Twisties brand to the Smith's Snackfood Company.\n\nDuring the late 1990s the Twisties brand went through a brand overhaul, coinciding with the acquisition of The Smith's Snackfood Company by Frito-Lay. During the brand overhaul the appearance of the packet was changed to a more modernised look, adopting its current logo. As well as this, the texture of the snack itself was altered, resulting in a smoother finish.\n\nTwisties were originally available only in '[[Cheese]]' flavour, but '[[Chicken]]' and 'Wicked Cheddar Zig-Zag' flavours were later introduced and became a standard part of the product line. There have also been flavours abroad as diverse as 'Toffee', 'Tomato', 'Salmon Teriyaki' and 'Peri Peri',  where the local palate suits them the most.\n\nTwisties are eaten as a snack in themselves, or sometimes in a sandwich as a \"Twistie buttie\" or \"Twisties roll\", by serving the packet contents between two slices of buttered bread or in a roll.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The cut and thrust of tuckshop tactics|last=Squires|first=Tony|date=26 August 1994|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Regional recipes add flavour to tucker tour of Australia|last=Dale|first=David|date=22 June 2008|work=Sun Herald|access-date=|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Bowled over|last=Preston|first=Matt|date=8 June 2010|work=The Courier-Mail|access-date=|page=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a Twisties batch was recalled after reports of consumers finding pieces of fine wire in packs, there were no reports of injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=In brief local|last=|first=|date=3 May 1997|work=The Age|access-date=|page=3}}</ref> The company thought that the wire resulted from machinery malfunction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Pins in soft toys work of 'maniac'|last=Honeysett|first=Stuart|date=3 May 1997|work=The Australian|access-date=|page=3}}</ref> In 2014, Twisties were one of the products removed from shops in Malaysia due to concerns around contamination from pork products.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=T|date=2015|title=Cadbury and pig DNA: when issue management intersects with religion|url=https://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/eserv/rmit:33957/n2006056309.pdf|journal=Corporate Communications|volume=20|issue=4|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Frito-Lay lost a trademark dispute with [[Aldi|Aldi Stores]], as Aldi's 'Chazoos' cheese twists were not considered to infringe on the registered trademark of Twisties on the basis of packaging, extrusion production or the sound of the product name.

Other base ingredients standard in every flavour are [[vegetable oil]], [[whey protein]], [[salt]], and [[monosodium glutamate]] (E621) as a flavour enhancer. Ingredients differ depending on the variety of Twisties.\n\nWendyl Nissen's review of packaged food noted that Twisties are a bit better than other super market snacks because the cheese flavouring is sourced from milk solids rather than chemical flavourings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A few twists in a cheesy old favourite Twisties $2.98 - 150gms|last=Nissen|first=Wendyl|date=4 September 2010|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the Herald Sun highlighted that Twisties contain not only MSG itself, but also HVP (hydrolysed vegetable protein) which is a source of MSG.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=What's in... Twisties|last=|first=|date=4 March 2011|work=Herald Sun (Melbourne)|access-date=|page=81}}</ref>\n\n*The ingredients for Cheese flavour are as follows, in order of percentage of product: corn and rice cereal, vegetable oil, whey powder, cheese powder, monosodium glutamate (E621), salt, [[hydrolyzed vegetable protein]], flavour, [[yeast extract]], [[potassium chloride]], cream powder, milk powder, natural colouring ([[Paprika oleoresin|paprika extract]] and [[carotene]]), [[lactic acid]].\n\nThe Twisties mixture is made by heating, shearing and pressurising corn, semolina, rice grits and water in a rotary head or random extruder, also known as the 'Twisties Press'. When the liquid mixture is passed through a hole between a spinning plate and a stationary plate, it expands, cools and solidifies to make characteristic knobbly surfaced, squiggly Twisties. A metal lug cuts the mixture into lengths.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Munchies|last=Leung|first=Cecilia|date=5 October 2000|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|page=18}}</ref> After forming, the pieces are oven baked before being flavoured with a coating of vegetable oil and a dusting of powdered whey, cheese powder, salt, monosodium glutamate, lactic acid and two types of food colouring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/from-factory-to-plate--20090428-alja.html|title=From factory to plate ...|last=Cornish|first=Richard|date=2009-04-28|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref> Factory seconds are sometimes fed to farm animals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Chip away at career|last=Miko|first=Tara|date=12 December 2014|work=The Chronicle (Toowoomba)|access-date=|page=5}}</ref>\n\n==Flavours==\nTwisties has a large variety of flavours which are sold in Australia, and in the different islands.

This could be attributed to Twisties' success.\n\nAdvertising for the snack has almost completely stopped in the last decade in comparison to its past promotions. Twisties' largest (and most expensive) campaign ever was between 1982-1983 with its \"Twisties jumper\" campaign. Lillian Darrell, a previously unknown actor, played the role of an old woman knitting a Twisties jumper straight from a sheep. The promotion included free knitting patterns and free bags of Twisties. Other promotions were attempted afterwards, but they resulted in little success. Currently, Twisties relies heavily on limited edition flavours to keep hype on a profitable level.\n\nIn 1986, [[Fred Nile]] complained about a Twisties television commercial to the Advertising Standards Council. He alleged that the Viking-themed advertisement used occult imagery and goats' heads and that it would disturb children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The moral screws are being tightened on books and films|last=Visontay|first=Michael|date=6 December 1986|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|page=16}}</ref> The commercial received a record number of 680 complaints alleging that it was \"...demonic and harmful to children,\" but it was noted that many were in similar handwriting.

The commercial featured a teenage boy being abducted by female space aliens, as they were interested in his packet of Twisties. The commercials were launched at the same time as the premier of the alien-themed [[Dark Skies]] series. The website included 'eyewitness reports' of the abduction and hid clues in a fictitious newspaper, the 'Twisted Examiner'.

Called 'twisties [sic]', they are manufactured by [[Bluebird Foods]] and are only available in cheese flavour. The packet features a penguin mascot about to throw a cheese curl as if it were a ball, and has a completely different slogan as compared to its Australian counterpart: it being \"It's a straight world without Twisties!\" They are less dense than the Australian variety, and their shape is more tubular and curvy without imperfections in the shape (Australian Twisties are more jagged and detailed). In New Zealand the Australian variety is not widely available.\n\n[[Image:fonzies.jpg|thumb|150px|A packet of Fonzies]]\nTwisties are also sold on the Italian market with the name 'Fonzies'.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Business Review Weekly: BRW|year=1991|volume=13|issue=26\u201334|page=43|quote=[...] in Europe, Twisties are sold under the Fonzies brand [...]}}</ref>  Fonzies are pale yellow in colour, because they do not use the bright orange food colouring that normal Twisties use. Their cheese flavouring is very similar to that used in the Oceanian varieties bearing the 'Twisties' name, lighter and less prone to clump together during consumption, and with a more natural cheese flavour. The only quality that differentiates it from said varieties is its slight egg-like taste upon first bite, though it wears away after continued consumption. It is made through the same rotary head extrusion technique as in all other localisations, though the snacks are much smaller than those found in Australia, sticking more to a general thin shape rather than a selection of both thin and stout snacks. Its smell is much more pungent, as well. Fonzies are available in 'Gli Originali' ('Original') flavour, as well as 'Time Out', 'Choco', 'Hot Passion', 'Bacon', 'Hot Chili' and others.\n\n*The ingredients for Fonzies are as follows, in order of percentage of product: corn grit 62.2%, palm oil, cheese powder 6%, whey powder, salt, flavour, baking powder, yeast extract, flavour enhancers (E621, E627, E631), lactose (from milk), smoke flavour.\n\nAlthough sold in Italy, Fonzies are produced in Germany by LU Snack Foods GmbH. In the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC countries]], they are also sold with the name 'Fonzies', produced by Kraft Malaysia.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.smiths.com.au/brands/twisties Twisties page by Smith's Snackfoods]\n\n{{PepsiCo}}\n\n[[Category:Australian snack foods]]\n[[Category:Brand name snack foods]]\n[[Category:The Smith's Snackfood Company brands]]\n", "name_user": "101.160.128.49", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I like se x)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisties"}
