[[Test cricket|Test]], [[One-day cricket|One Day]] and [[First-class cricket|First class]] [[cricket]] matches are played here.  It is also the home ground for the [[Highveld Lions cricket team|Highveld Lions]], formerly known as Gauteng ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]).\n\n==History==\nThe stadium has a [[seating capacity]] of 34,000, and was built in 1956 to replace the [[Old Wanderers Stadium]]. It was completely overhauled following South Africa's readmission to international cricket in 1991. In 1996, five new {{convert|65|m|ft |adj=mid |-high}} [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]] masts replaced the existing four {{convert|30 |m|ft |adj=mid|-high}} masts, enabling day-night limited-overs cricket. It is nicknamed 'The Bullring' due to its design and intimidating atmosphere.\n\nOn 1 October 2004, the Wanderers Clubhouse was virtually destroyed by fire. At that stage it was known as Liberty Life Wanderers, but as from the 2008/09 season, [[Bidvest Group]] took up the sponsoring of the ground, thus it became its present-day name of BIDVest Wanderers Stadium until the end of September 2019.\n\nOn 4 October 2019, the Wanderers Stadium announced a new naming rights deal with Imperial Logistics.

It hosted matches of the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] including the first match and the final which was won by India, who defeated Pakistan.\n\nOn 18 January 2015, the Wanderers stadium saw South Africa's [[AB de Villiers]] break the 19-year-old record for fastest ODI half-century, previously held by Sri Lankan maestro [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], by making 50 off 16 balls against the [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]].

In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the [[University of London]] as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the School's [[Regent's Park]] campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the ''London Business School'' and was incorporated by [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]], which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the [[Columbia Business School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/facts/history#.VuX0SlMrLaY|title=LBS History|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a new campus was opened in [[Dubai]] to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the [[University of Hong Kong]] and [[Columbia Business School]], and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent.<ref name=\"LBS Expansion\"/> The building was renamed \"The Sammy Ofer Centre\" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-Marylebone-town-hall/index.html|title=Sammy Ofer Centre|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312011214/https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-marylebone-town-hall/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.\n\nWith the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a \u00a3100 million funding campaign.

There is also a privately run pub, 'The Windsor Castle' attached to the campus. Most classrooms for the MBA are located in the Sainsbury Wing, the centre of the terrace, most of which are 100-student [[amphitheatre]] rooms.\n\nThere is no accommodation on campus for students in full-time programmes, although there are rooms on-campus for visiting faculty and [[executive education]] participants.

In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the [[University of London]] as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the School's [[Regent's Park]] campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the ''London Business School'' and was incorporated by [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]], which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the [[Columbia Business School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/facts/history#.VuX0SlMrLaY|title=LBS History|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a new campus was opened in [[Dubai]] to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the [[University of Hong Kong]] and [[Columbia Business School]], and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent.<ref name=\"LBS Expansion\"/> The building was renamed \"The Sammy Ofer Centre\" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-Marylebone-town-hall/index.html|title=Sammy Ofer Centre|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312011214/https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-marylebone-town-hall/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.\n\nWith the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a \u00a3100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised \u00a398 million, \u00a340 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with \u00a328 million for research, \u00a318 million in scholarships for students, \u00a310 million to increase the school's endowment, and \u00a34 million to improve technology across the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|title=Funding campaign|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220101627/https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|archive-date=20 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> By June 2016, the school had raised \u00a3125 million, including two \u00a325 million gifts from alumni [[Jim Ratcliffe]] and [[Idan Ofer]].<ref name=\"ftraiseslbsmoules\">{{cite news|last1=Moules|first1=Jonathan|title=London Business School raises \u00a3125m in first fundraising|url=https://next.ft.com/content/b97a1762-316b-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=Financial Times|date=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Ortalo-Magn\u00e9]], the French-born former Dean of the [[Wisconsin School of Business]], succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017.<ref name=\"ftlbsappoints\">{{cite news|last1=Vina|first1=Gonzalo|title=LBS appoints Fran\u00e7ois Ortalo-Magn\u00e9 as dean|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8ee0659e-5284-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef|accessdate=25 March 2017|work=Financial Times|date=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nThe campus is located in [[Marylebone]], on the perimeter of [[Regent's Park]].

There is also a privately run pub, 'The Windsor Castle' attached to the campus. Most classrooms for the MBA are located in the Sainsbury Wing, the centre of the terrace, most of which are 100-student [[amphitheatre]] rooms.\n\nThere is no accommodation on campus for students in full-time programmes, although there are rooms on-campus for visiting faculty and [[executive education]] participants. Most students choose to live in nearby private residential buildings or in students halls of residence such as the [[International Students House, London]].\n\nLBS is expanding its campus in central London. The business school has redeveloped the Old Marylebone Town Hall into classrooms and offices as the Sammy Ofer Centre.  It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/newsandevents/news/2013/09/Landmark_%C2%A325_million_gift_for_London_Business_School%E2%80%99s_Old_Marylebone_Town_Hall_1695.html|title=News|work=london.edu|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LBS campus 2.jpg|350px|thumbnail|left|The Sussex Palace, main campus in London]]\n\n[[File:Sammy Ofer Center.jpg|340px|thumbnail|center|The Marylebone Town Hall, second campus in London]]\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n=== List of the London Business School Deans ===\nList of the Deans from 1965 to today:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/people/the-dean#.VuMh6FMrK1t|title=LBS Deans|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Starting year\n!Ending year\n!Name\n|-\n|1965\n|1972\n|Dr. Arthur Earle\n|-\n|1972\n|1984\n|Professor Sir James Ball\n|-\n|1984\n|1989\n|Professor [[Peter G.

Candidates are also asked to write several [[essay]]s (topics are related to the envisaged programmes). The recruitment process has two steps. The first one consists of sending an application with the following information:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/education-and-development/masters-courses/masters-in-financial-analysis/how-to-apply#.VuX1AFMrLaY|title=How to apply|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927120841/https://www.london.edu/education-and-development/masters-courses/masters-in-financial-analysis/how-to-apply#.VuX1AFMrLaY|archive-date=27 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* An application form (administrative and academic information on the candidate, but also his/her career plan and personal ambitions)\n* Several essays\n* The GMAT or GRE scores. The average GMAT score is usually around 700 (90th percentile)\n* The TOEFL scores (English test)\n* A one-page resume (CV)\n* Two reference letters (one academic and one professional)\n* The candidate's academic transcript with his/her grades\nOnce the application has been accepted, an examination is made by the selection committee. If the candidate meets the criteria of the school, he/she will be invited for an interview on campus in London. If this latter step is a success, the candidate receives an offer from LBS.\n\n=== Master in Business Administration (MBA) ===\nThe school's flagship programme is its full-time 15\u201321-month [[Master of Business Administration]] degree. MBA students take a prescribed set of core courses then choose from roughly 70 different electives. Class size has been around 400 students in every annual cohort. These are broken into 5 streams of around 80 students who take all core courses together. The admission process is highly competitive and selective.\n\nBeyond academics, the school puts an emphasis on personal and professional development including [[leadership development|leadership]], global awareness, and business skill building. These developments are facilitated via specialized workshops led by external consultants, students, and faculty. In addition to a range of elective courses at the London Business School, the school has partnerships with around 32 exchange schools around the world.  Each academic year around 100 students spend a term at another leading business school.\n\nThe MBA program at LBS is widely considered to be part of the top 10 in the world.
