Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\".

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z. (album)|D.A.Z.]] in the song \"Iz You Ready to die\" and in [[DJ Quik]] in the song \"Boogie Till You Conk Out\" in 2011.\n\n===2004\u20132012===\n[[File:Ice cube c.jpg|thumb|right|Ice Cube performing live in Metro City Concert Club on October 29, 2010.]]\nIn 2004, he appeared in the [[Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz]] song, \"[[Real Nigga Roll Call]]\".\nIn late 2005, Ice Cube and [[R.

After launching that comeback album, Ice Cube toured across the world to promote it. The tour is known as \"Straight Outta Compton Tour\", and accompanying him is his friend and fellow rapper WC from the Westside Connection. Some places he has recently performed include the Paradiso in [[Amsterdam]] and various venues in England. After touring the U.S. and Europe, he performed all around Australia, from Sydney's [[Enmore Theatre]] to The Forum Arena in Melbourne, before heading to Japan.\n\nIce Cube collaborated with [[Tech N9ne]] on the song \"Blackboy\" that appears on Tech N9ne's July 2008 album ''[[Killer (Tech N9ne album)|Killer]]''.

Ice Cube has stated this album has a different direction than any one of his other albums. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and [[Sir Jinx]], not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label [[Lench Mob Records|Lench Mob]]. Ice Cube has stated that \"being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box'.\" He also signed an upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. \"Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me.\"\n\nIn November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he's recording. He also stated he \"always got an album coming out\" which suggests that he isn't thinking of rap retirement to focus on acting in the near future.\n\n===2012\u2013present: ''Everythang's Corrupt''===\nIn 2012, Ice Cube recorded a verse for a remix of the [[Insane Clown Posse]] song \"[[Chris Benoit (song)|Chris Benoit]]\", from ICP's ''[[The Mighty Death Pop!]]'' album, appearing on the album ''[[Mike E.

Ice Cube was the only member of N.W.A who is not from [[Compton, California]] (where it was formed).\n\nBy this point Ice Cube was a full-time member of N.W.A along with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[MC Ren]]. Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet \"Natural Born Killaz\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''.

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.
