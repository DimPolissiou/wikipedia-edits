Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor. As senior White House advisor, Kushner stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel. Kushner had an influential role within the Trump administration in its response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which included advising Trump in the first two months of the outbreak that the media was exaggerating the threat of the virus, and later on helping to draft an error-riddled Oval Office address about the crisis.\n\n== Early life (1981\u20132007) ==\nKushner was born in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and [[Charles Kushner]], a real-estate developer and convicted felon.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |title=The Legacy |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 12, 2009 |first=Gabriel |last=Sherman |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103120035/http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref> \n\nHis paternal grandparents, Reichel and [[Joseph Kushner]], were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from [[Navahrudak]], now in [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |title=What Does Trump's Presidency Mean for Belarus? |last=Rudnik |first=Alesia |last2=Smok |first2=Vadzim |date=November 18, 2016 |website=BelarusDigest.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180709183434/https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |title=The Young Trump: Jared Kushner's Rise to Unimaginable Power |first=Andrew |last=Rice |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115000329/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |archivedate=January 15, 2017 }}</ref> Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's [[maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kushner Insider January 30, 2015 |url=https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |website=[[Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy]]/[[Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422084708/https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |archivedate=April 22, 2016  |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> \n\nRaised in a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] family,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |title=Jared Kushner once broke up with Ivanka Trump over 'religion issue' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132903/http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}</ref> Kushner graduated from the [[Frisch School]], a Modern Orthodox [[Jewish day school|yeshiva high school]], in 1999.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor. As senior White House advisor, Kushner stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel. Kushner had an influential role within the Trump administration in its response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which included advising Trump in the first two months of the outbreak that the media was exaggerating the threat of the virus, and later on helping to draft an error-riddled Oval Office address about the crisis.\n\n== Early life (1981\u20132007) ==\nKushner was born in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and [[Charles Kushner]], a real-estate developer and convicted felon.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |title=The Legacy |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 12, 2009 |first=Gabriel |last=Sherman |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103120035/http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref> \n\nHis paternal grandparents, Reichel and [[Joseph Kushner]], were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from [[Navahrudak]], now in [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |title=What Does Trump's Presidency Mean for Belarus? |last=Rudnik |first=Alesia |last2=Smok |first2=Vadzim |date=November 18, 2016 |website=BelarusDigest.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180709183434/https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |title=The Young Trump: Jared Kushner's Rise to Unimaginable Power |first=Andrew |last=Rice |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115000329/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |archivedate=January 15, 2017 }}</ref> Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's [[maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kushner Insider January 30, 2015 |url=https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |website=[[Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy]]/[[Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422084708/https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |archivedate=April 22, 2016  |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> \n\nRaised in a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] family,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |title=Jared Kushner once broke up with Ivanka Trump over 'religion issue' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132903/http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}</ref> Kushner graduated from the [[Frisch School]], a Modern Orthodox [[Jewish day school|yeshiva high school]], in 1999.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on November 5, 1995. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] despises the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear plant]]'s new exercise program and decides to gain {{convert|61|lb|kg|0}} to claim a [[disability]] and work at home.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Dan Greaney]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. Joan Kenley makes her second of three guest appearances on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode as the voice of the telephone lady. It features cultural references to the [[McGuire twins|world's heaviest twins]], the 1993 film ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'', and the soft drink [[Tab (drink)|Tab]]. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics, and ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' named it the best episode of the series. \n\nIt acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 10.0, and was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mr. Burns]] organizes a morning [[calisthenics]] program at the nuclear power plant, to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s dismay. After learning that an employee who is [[disability|disabled]] can work from home through [[Workers' compensation|worker's compensation]], Homer unsuccessfully tries to injure himself. Upon learning that employees who weigh {{convert|300|lb|kg|0}} or more qualify as disabled, he begins eating excessively, despite [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s repeated warnings that he is endangering his health. With [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Dr Nick]]'s help, Homer gains the {{convert|61|lb|kg|0}} needed to reach 300 and Mr. Burns installs a stay-at-home work [[Computer terminal|terminal]] in the Simpson house. Marge admits that she finds herself less attracted to Homer because of his weight gain, but he vows to prove he can be a better worker because of it.\n\nHomer soon tires of his monotonous responsibilities as a safety inspector and resorts to simply typing [[Yes (Unix)|\"yes\"]] every time the system prompts him. Looking for shortcuts, he leaves his terminal with a [[drinking bird]] to press the Y key to indicate \"yes\" on the keyboard and goes to the cinema. After being denied admission due to his weight, Homer returns to find that his bird has fallen over and a [[nuclear meltdown]] is imminent unless the system is manually shut down.\n\nUnable to call the plant because his fingers are too fat to dial a telephone keypad, and too heavy to drive or skateboard, Homer resorts to hitchhiking. Drivers refuse to pick him up because his bright [[muumuu]] and excited jabbering make him seem like a lunatic. After hijacking an [[Ice cream van|ice cream truck]], Homer arrives at the power plant during a workout program and reaches the shutdown button. He falls onto the gas storage tank, blocking the release tube with the oversized lower half of his body and preventing an explosion. Grateful, Mr. Burns gives Homer a medal for bravery and offers him any request he chooses. Realizing how his obesity has made life hard for his family, Homer asks Burns to make him thin again. After a failed attempt at calisthenics, Burns agrees to pay for Homer's [[liposuction]].\n\n==Production==\n\"King-Size Homer\" was written by [[Dan Greaney]], and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. It was the first episode Greaney wrote for ''The Simpsons''. Prior to this episode he was working as a lawyer and was contemplating moving to [[Ukraine]] to work for a start-up company. He said that this episode \"saved\" him from doing so.<ref name=\"Geaney\"/> Greaney pitched some ideas to the writing staff, but none of them were satisfactory, so then-show runner [[Bill Oakley]] gave him the idea for this episode.<ref name=\"Geaney\">{{cite video |people=Greaney, Dan |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"King-Size Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Oakley had Greaney come to [[Hollywood]] to write it, and when Greaney showed the first draft to the staff, they liked it, so Oakley hired him.<ref name=\"Geaney\"/>\n\nThe writers wanted the title of the episode to make Homer sound proud about his weight, so they decided to name it \"King-Size Homer\".<ref name=\"Oakley\">{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"King-Size Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Greaney really enjoyed working on the episode because Homer is constantly happy and goal-oriented in it, instead of being a slob who is \"eating all the time\".<ref name=\"Geaney\"/> Animator [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] designed the obese Homer for the episode.<ref name=\"Silverman\">{{cite video |people=Silverman, David |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"King-Size Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> There was a discussion about what Homer would wear when he became fat, and they decided to go with a [[muumuu]].<ref name=\"Oakley\"/> The writers were also discussing about how they were going to treat Homer's obesity. They did not want Homer to come off as a \"hog\", so they decided that the viewer should barely see him eating after he reaches his 300 pounds goal.<ref name=\"Geaney\"/> As the writers were trying to figure out a way to get Homer back to his old weight by the end of the episode, it was suggested that Homer should feel bad about his obesity, and therefore become thin for Marge, but that idea was scrapped in early production.<ref name=\"Geaney\"/> Action figurines based on obese Homer were made for the [[World of Springfield]] in December 2001.<ref name=\"Groening\">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"King-Size Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nHomer has a dream in which he is standing at the foot of a mountain with 300 pounds as the goal at the top. A pig wearing a tuxedo appears next to him in the dream, and motivates Homer to reach the top of the mountain. This scene was inspired by the cover of the \"Sweetness and Light\" issue of [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'']] magazine.<ref name=\"Geaney\"/> The staff thought that [[Cary Grant]] would have been ideal for the pig in Homer's dream sequence, but he died nine years before the episode was made, so they used cast member [[Hank Azaria]] for that voice.<ref name=\"Geaney\"/> Joan Kenley guest starred in the episode as the telephone lady.<ref name=\"book\"/> The staff flew her down from [[Northern California]] to record her part for the episode.<ref name=\"Reardon\">{{cite video |people=Reardon, Jim |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode \"King-Size Homer\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nWhile Homer is in the clothes store, two [[mannequin]]s wearing similar outfits and riding on bikes are shown. These are based on [[McGuire twins|Billy and Benny McCrary]], the world's heaviest twins who weighed over {{convert|700|lb|kg|0}} each. They received fame after appearing in ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'' in a picture that depicts the twins riding their [[Honda motorcycles]]. They would appear again in the same season in the episode \"[[The Day the Violence Died]]\".<ref name=\"Oakley\"/> The scene in which Bart and his friends observe the obese Homer through a window is based on a scene from the 1993 film ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]''.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nHomer thinks that he can order the soft drink [[Tab (drink)|Tab]] by pressing the [[tab key]] on the keyboard, and becomes anxious when he can't find the \"[[any key]]\".<ref name=\"Oakley\"/> When Homer vents gas from a nuclear reactor, the gas destroys crops of corn. A farmer says, \"Oh no, the corn! [[Paul Newman]]'s gonna have ma' legs broke!\". This is in reference to the legend of [[Newman's Own]] popcorn products, in which Newman threatened anyone who might attempt to steal his popcorn.<ref name=\"Groening\"/> At the cinema, Homer tries to watch the film ''Honk If You're Horny'', starring actor [[Pauly Shore]] and actress [[Faye Dunaway]].<ref name=\"BBC\"/> When Mr. Burns awards Homer a medal at the end of the episode, he praises him for \"turning a potential [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] into a mere [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]],\" referencing the real-life [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]] that occurred at those locations.\n\n==Reception==\nIn its original broadcast, \"King-Size Homer\" finished 45th (tied with ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'') in the ratings for the week of October 30 to November 3, 1995, with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 10.0.<ref name=ratings>{{cite news |title=CBS Tops In Weekend Ratings Race |date=November 10, 1995 |page=44D |work=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |author=Moore, Frazier}} Retrieved on December 6, 2008.</ref> The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week.<ref name=ratings/>\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics, making many top episode lists. \n\nIn 2008, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' placed ''The Simpsons'' at the top of their list of \"The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\", and noted \"King-Size Homer\" as the show's best episode, calling it \"An unimprovable mix of sharp dialogue, hilarious sight gags and heart.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=1 |title=The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time |accessdate=2008-03-29 |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]}}</ref>  \n\nKimberly Potts of [[AOL Television]] named the episode the seventh best episode of the series. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://television.aol.com/feature/the-simpsons |title='The Simpsons' Best Episodes Ever |last=Potts |first=Kimberly |publisher=AOL Television |accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref>  \n\nMichael Moran of ''[[The Times]]'' ranked it as the tenth best.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6988097.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1 |title=The 10 best Simpsons episodes ever |last=Moran |first=Michael |date=January 14, 2010 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref> \n\n\"King-Size Homer\" appeared on ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of the ten best episodes on ''The Simpsons'' that represent the comic and emotional scope of the show.<ref>{{cite news |title=The best of \"The Simpsons\" doing their worst |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=April 26, 1998 |work=The Star-Ledger |page=5}}</ref> \n\nThe ''[[Herald Sun]]'' put the episode at ninth place on their list of the top twenty episodes of ''The Simpsons'', and highlighted the scene in which Homer is seen \"commandeering an ice cream truck in a frantic dash to the nuclear plant to avoid an impending meltdown\".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Simpsons Top 20 |date=April 21, 2007 |work=Herald Sun |page=W09}}</ref> \n\nEmily VanDerWerff of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' named the episode the show's fifth best, stating \"while there are a lot of funny jokes in this episode (including Homer's fingers that are too fat to dial), the best thing about it is the sight of Homer, weighing well over 300 pounds, dressed in a muumuu and a 'fat guy hat.'
