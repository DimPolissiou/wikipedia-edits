{"title_page": "Economic geography of the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{update|date=January 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\nThe '''economic geography of the United Kingdom''' reflects its high position in the current economic league tables, as well as reflecting its long history as a trading nation and as an [[British empire|imperial power]].  This in turn was built on [[exploitation of natural resources]] such as coal and iron ore.\n\nMuch has changed since Bevan's speech (below) in 1945, with the coalfields largely deserted and the Empire relinquished.  With its dominant position gone, the UK economic geography is increasingly shaped by the one constant: it is a [[trading nation]].\n\n==Agriculture==\nThe UK has rarely been self-sufficient in terms of food supply and its modern pattern of agriculture reflects a combination of history, current public policy and [[comparative advantage]].\n\nSince the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Enclosure Acts]] of the eighteenth century, the UK's uplands (including [[Wales]] and the [[Scottish Highlands]]) have largely been associated with [[animal husbandry]] and [[forestry]].  However, by the time of the Enclosure Acts, most of lowland Britain was already enclosed by processes such as [[assarting]] or illegal, but tolerated, piecemeal enclosure.  However, evidence of the former [[open field system]] of agriculture can still be seen in some parts of the landscape, such as in the indentations remaining from boundary ditches of the former farming strips. Enclosure, in turn, led to intensification.\n\nMost UK agriculture is [[intensive farming|intensive]] and highly mechanised, with the use of chemical [[fertiliser]]s and [[insecticide]]s routine.  By European standards it is very efficient, although that does not necessarily make it profitable.  This intense nature was compounded in the post-War years, with fields being expanded at the expense of [[hedgerows]].  This process has been heavily criticised for damaging [[biodiversity]].\n\n[[East Anglia]] and [[South East England]] have been centres for grain production, with some areas of [[South East England]] also specialising in [[Market Gardening|market gardening]]. The county of [[Kent]] was so well known for this that it is often referred to as the ''Garden of England'' and was particularly noted for [[hops|hop]] growing. Dairy farming is most prevalent in [[South West England]].\n\nThe detailed pattern of modern UK agriculture is heavily influenced by the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] of the [[European Union]], with a combination of price support and [[set-aside]] policy.\n\nAround the edges of south eastern towns, perfectly good agricultural land often remains uncultivated as a result of price distortions created by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Indeed, since around 2001 speculators have been buying Green Belt agricultural land, generally adjacent to built up areas, and selling it off in plots, persuading buyers that the government will have to weaken Green Belt protection to solve the housing crisis (see below). It is hard to see when such plots could come back into production.\n\n==Primary industry==\nThe UK's primary industry sector was once dominated by the coal industry, heavily concentrated in [[South Wales Coalfield|south Wales]], [[English Midlands|Midlands]] ([[North Staffordshire Coalfield|north]] and [[South Staffordshire Coalfield|south]] Staffordshire, [[Leicestershire and South Derbyshire Coalfield|Derbyshire]] , Warwickshire and [[Nottinghamshire]] etc.), [[South Yorkshire Coalfield|Yorkshire]], [[North East England]] ([[Northumberland Coalfield|Northumberland]] and [[Durham Coalfield|Durham]]) and southern [[Scotland]]  ([[Fife Coalfield|Fife]] and [[Midlothian Coalfield|Midlothian]]).  The number of pits and miners have been slashed, and output fell by more than 75% between 1981 and 2003.  The remaining pits produced 17.2&nbsp;million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2003, making the UK the 15th largest coal producing nation, compared with 4th in 1981, according to the [[BP]] Statistical Review of World Energy 2004.\n\nThe major primary industry is [[North Sea oil]].  Its activity is concentrated on the east coast of [[Scotland]] and [[North East England]]. The waters in the North Sea off the east coast of Scotland contain nearly half of the UK's remaining [[oil reserves]], and a quarter of reserves are located in the North Sea near the Shetland Islands.  As of January 2004, the UK had proven crude oil reserves of 4.7&nbsp;billion barrels (750,000,000 m\u00b3) including onshore reserves, according to the ''Oil and Gas Journal''.\n\nA closely related industry is natural gas which, since the 1970s, has supplied all of the UK gas needs, replacing poisonous [[coal gas|coal, or town, gas]].  Most natural gas production is in the North Sea, with a small amount onshore and in the [[Irish Sea]].  The largest reserves not related to oil production are in the southern North Sea between the UK and the [[Netherlands]], although; the largest reserves, are associated with oil production.  The UK is expected to become a net natural gas importer before 2010.\n\n==Manufacturing==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+'''Manufacturing employment by region, '''\n!  style=\"width:100px; background:#f99;\"|Region\n! style=\"background:#f99;\"|2000\n! style=\"background:#f99;\"|% \n! style=\"background:#f99;\"|2003<br>(est)\n! style=\"background:#f99;\"|% \n|-\n|Eastern \n|333,781\n|15.0\n|379,000\n|14.1\n|-\n|East Midlands\n|383,360\n| 22.1\n|382,000\n|19\n|-\n|London \n|287,211\n|7.1\n|263,000\n|7.7\n|-\n|North East\n|175,569 \n|18.2 \n|174,000\n|16.3\n|-\n|North West \n|499,020 \n|17.6 \n|492,000\n|16\n|-\n|Northern Ireland\n|n/a\n|n/a\n|95,000\n|13\n|-\n|Scotland\n|302,473 \n|13.6 \n|291,000\n|12.3\n|-\n|South East\n|436,753\n|12.0\n|501,000\n|12.4\n|-\n|South West\n|302,288\n|15.0\n|323,000\n|13.4\n|-\n|Wales\n|200,951 \n|18.6 \n|201,000\n|15.8\n|-\n|West Midlands\n|494,798\n|21.6\n|479,000\n|20.5\n|-\n|Yorkshire and the Humber\n|383,641\n|18.4\n|372,000\n|16.1\n|-\n|'''United Kingdom''' \n|'''3,799,845 '''\n|'''15.1 '''\n|'''3,790,000'''\n|'''14.3'''\n|- \n| colspan=\"5\" |Source: ''ONS Annual Business Inquiry''\n|}\n\nAt one time or another virtually every product that can be imagined has been made in the UK.  In particular its heavy manufacturing drove the [[industrial revolution]], starting with the first [[blast furnace]] at [[Coalbrookdale]] in Shropshire.\n\nA map of the major UK cities gives a good picture of where manufacturing flourished, and often specialisations could be identified, in particular: \n*[[Birmingham]], (automotive)\n*[[Glasgow]] (shipbuilding),\n*London (various),\n*[[Manchester]] (textiles),\n*[[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] (shipbuilding and steel),\n*[[Nottingham]] (apparel, medicine),\n*[[Sheffield]] (steel and steel products)\n*[[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] (shipbuilding and coal-mining)\n*[[Leeds]] (textiles and engineering)\n*[[Belfast]] (shipbuilding and textiles)\n*[[Cardiff]] (steel)\n\nThe automotive industry can be traced back to the 1890s (growing after World War I), by which time industries such as shipbuilding, textiles and steel were already established.\n\nIn the inter-War years modern industries emerged, with [[aerospace]] forming clusters around London, [[Bristol]] and in [[Hertfordshire]]. The Hertfordshire cluster no longer exists. The early [[electronics]] industry generally preferred the south, especially the [[home counties]].\n\nToday there is no heavy manufacturing industry in which UK-based firms can be considered world leaders and no product in which a UK city or region is ''the'' world leader. {{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nHowever, the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], in particular, remains a strong manufacturing centre, with around a fifth of employment dependent on manufacturing, and the [[East Midlands Development Agency]] has a policy to maintaining this characteristic.\n\nMore recently, high technology firms have concentrated largely along the [[M4 motorway]], partly because of access to [[London Heathrow Airport]], but also because of the [[economies of agglomeration]].  However, the general pattern remains that the south has lower, and falling, reliance on manufacturing.\n\n==Finance and services==\n[[File:Leeds CBD at night.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Leeds]]' Central Business District]]\n{{See also|Economy of London}}\n\nOnce, every great city had a [[stock exchange]]. Now, the UK financial industry is concentrated overwhelmingly in the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]], with back office and administrative operation often  dispersed around the south of England.\n\nLondon is one of the world's great [[financial centre]]s, which is one of the factors that is commonly considered to make it a [[world city]].  [[Central London]] contains some of the most expensive [[real estate|commercial property]] in the world because of this.\n\nFrom around the early 1990s London has been able to boast of having more U.S. banks than New York, as well as being host to branches of more than five hundred overseas banks.  It is the principal financial centre of the world, ranked alongside New York and Tokyo as one of three where any serious financial player ''must'' be represented.\n\nThe [[City of London]] has around 300,000 employees, largely concentrated in the financial and professional sectors.\n\nWithin London, the desire for banks to be there put pressure on the City of London's ability to accommodate them.  In the mid-1980s a crisis point was reached and, although the City was able to expand its stock of modern office space, this did not happen before [[Canary Wharf]] had been set up as a competitor.  The irony is that Canary Wharf was built in the [[London Docklands]] that had, until 1970, been among the largest docks in the world. All manner of goods had been shipped from the factories of east London to the world; between 1961 and 1993 manufacturing employment in London fell from 1.6&nbsp;million to 328,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exploring 20th century London: Work|publisher=Museum of London|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Collections-Research/Research/Your-Research/X20L/themes/1376/1376|accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, [[Leeds]] took advantage of the internet's arrival as part of the [[.com boom]].  It became the UK's first city to have full broadband and digital coverage, making it a very attractive place for corporations to expand, particularly when opening call centres.  During the changing 1990s, Leeds had better connections to London than any other UK city, being 2 hours from London by train.

This has led successive governments to develop [[regional policy|regional policies]] to try to rectify the imbalance.\n\nThe success has been, at best, patchy and the uneven distribution of economic wealth in the UK has led to migration from north to south, aggravating serious pressure on the southern housing market.\n\nAlthough, in 2004, house prices in the north of England and Scotland increased faster than those in the south, this happened at the same stage of the last property cycle and the rises are off of a lower value base \u2013 it is far too early{{When|date=February 2016}} to conclude whether the trend is reversing.  Either way, there were 113,000 transactions in London and the [[South east England|South East]] recorded by the UK [[HM Land Registry]] in the year to November 2004, compared with 83,000 in the [[Northern England|North]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]].\n\nThis is not to say that the south is uniformly wealthy; some of the worst pockets of deprivation can be found in London, especially inner London, while [[Hastings]] and [[Bexhill-on-Sea]], on the south coast, are also subject to urgent regeneration efforts.\n\n==Quotes==\n<center>''\"This island is made mainly of coal and surrounded by fish.

The number of pits and miners have been slashed, and output fell by more than 75% between 1981 and 2003.

This has led successive governments to develop [[regional policy|regional policies]] to try to rectify the imbalance.\n\nThe success has been, at best, patchy and the uneven distribution of economic wealth in the UK has led to migration from north to south, aggravating serious pressure on the southern housing market.\n\nAlthough, in 2004, house prices in the north of England and Scotland increased faster than those in the south, this happened at the same stage of the last property cycle and the rises are off of a lower value base \u2013 it is far too early{{When|date=February 2016}} to conclude whether the trend is reversing.  Either way, there were 113,000 transactions in London and the [[South east England|South East]] recorded by the UK [[HM Land Registry]] in the year to November 2004, compared with 83,000 in the [[Northern England|North]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]].\n\nThis is not to say that the south is uniformly wealthy; some of the worst pockets of deprivation can be found in London, especially inner London, while [[Hastings]] and [[Bexhill-on-Sea]], on the south coast, are also subject to urgent regeneration efforts.\n\n==Quotes==\n<center>''\"This island is made mainly of coal and surrounded by fish.

After looking at the circumstances that night, the investigation was not able to conclude whether having another crew member would have prevented the accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\nAir brakes on the train are supplied with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive on the train. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If the system is not recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied as in the case of the Lac-M\u00e9gantic accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary /> However, it is the usual practice for an engineer parking a train, once the train is stopped, to apply the brakes on the cars in the train by releasing air from the train line, and allowing the air in the cars' reservoirs to apply the cars' brakes. Therefore, it would not matter if the automatic brakes applied themselves or not, as the car brakes would already be in the applied position. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the \u201creset safety control\u201d on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train's brakes in the event of an engine failure.<ref name=\"G&M20129764\">{{cite news|title=Lac-M\u00e9gantic derailment: Anatomy of a disaster|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lac-megantic-derailment-anatomy-of-a-disaster/article20129764 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M20110506\">{{cite news|title=Lac-M\u00e9gantic report: 18 things that went wrong|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lac-megantic-report-18-things-that-went-wrong/article20110506/?from=20129764|newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars are equipped with at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Had there been a two-man crew, they would have been able to perform a stabilization test, by releasing  all air brakes  and ensuring just the hand brakes would hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===Eight months before the derailment===\n\nIn October 2012, the lead locomotive, a [[GE C30-7]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian police seek to block sale of ill-fated MM&A locomotive | website=Railway Age | date=2014-07-24 | url=https://www.railwayage.com/news/canadian-police-seek-to-block-sale-of-ill-fated-mma-locomotive/ }}</ref> #5017 was sent to MMA's repair shop following an engine failure.

Tafisa, a local [[particleboard]] industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Gr\u00e9goire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars.<ref>{{cite web |title=Le conducteur Harding aurait permis d'\u00e9loigner des wagons du brasier |url=https://www.ledevoir.com/environnement/actualites-sur-l-environnement/382896/le-conducteur-harding-aurait-permis-d-eloigner-des-wagons-du-brasier |work=Le Devoir |date=July 13, 2013 |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Andy Blatchford |agency=Canadian Press |url=https://windsorstar.com/news/national/Witnesses+describe+train+driver+raced+disaster+scene/8653801/story.html |title=The frantic moment when the train driver in Lac-Megantic raced to the scene |newspaper=Windsor Star |date=July 15, 2013 |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created [[firebreak]]s and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's [[storm sewer]] system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/tragedie-a-lac-megantic/201307/10/01-4669313-plusieurs-travailleurs-ont-risque-leur-vie-sur-la-ligne-de-feu.php |title=Plusieurs travailleurs ont risqu\u00e9 leur vie sur la ligne de feu |author=CHRISTIANE DESJARDINS, DAVID SANTERRE et Gabrielle Duchaine |newspaper=La Presse |language=French |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter 20 hours, the centre of the fire was still inaccessible to firefighters<ref name=ctv /> and five pools of fuel were still burning.

Content of blended crude from multiple wells is not tested before loading, even though FRA indicates that \u201cit is critical that shippers determine the proper classification of the crude oil\u201d as a tanker with a higher safety classification (and not the standard DOT-111A car) is required for corrosive or explosive materials. The information is needed for provision to first responders and emergency services during a disaster.\n\nIn an increasing number of incidents, chemicals such as [[hydrochloric acid]] (used to release crude from oil well rock formations) have corroded tanks, covers, valves and fittings. As unit trains of tanker cars do not pass over weigh-in-motion scales in classification yards, many are overloaded, increasing risks of leakage as oil expands with temperature. The result has been twice the number of leaks from crude oil shipments as from alcohol shipments, the next highest hazardous material, even though comparable volumes of each travel by rail.<ref name=np-fra/>\n\nIn January 2014, Canada's Transportation Safety Board recommended that DOT-111 / CTC-111A oil-by-rail cars built before October 2011 be replaced with the newer, reinforced design.

After looking at the circumstances that night, the investigation was not able to conclude whether having another crew member would have prevented the accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\nAir brakes on the train are supplied with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive on the train. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If the system is not recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied as in the case of the Lac-M\u00e9gantic accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary /> However, it is the usual practice for an engineer parking a train, once the train is stopped, to apply the brakes on the cars in the train by releasing air from the train line, and allowing the air in the cars' reservoirs to apply the cars' brakes. Therefore, it would not matter if the automatic brakes applied themselves or not, as the car brakes would already be in the applied position. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be.

This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Had there been a two-man crew, they would have been able to perform a stabilization test, by releasing  all air brakes  and ensuring just the hand brakes would hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===Eight months before the derailment===\n\nIn October 2012, the lead locomotive, a [[GE C30-7]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian police seek to block sale of ill-fated MM&A locomotive | website=Railway Age | date=2014-07-24 | url=https://www.railwayage.com/news/canadian-police-seek-to-block-sale-of-ill-fated-mma-locomotive/ }}</ref> #5017 was sent to MMA's repair shop following an engine failure.

Tafisa, a local [[particleboard]] industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Gr\u00e9goire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars.<ref>{{cite web |title=Le conducteur Harding aurait permis d'\u00e9loigner des wagons du brasier |url=https://www.ledevoir.com/environnement/actualites-sur-l-environnement/382896/le-conducteur-harding-aurait-permis-d-eloigner-des-wagons-du-brasier |work=Le Devoir |date=July 13, 2013 |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Andy Blatchford |agency=Canadian Press |url=https://windsorstar.com/news/national/Witnesses+describe+train+driver+raced+disaster+scene/8653801/story.html |title=The frantic moment when the train driver in Lac-Megantic raced to the scene |newspaper=Windsor Star |date=July 15, 2013 |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created [[firebreak]]s and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's [[storm sewer]] system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/tragedie-a-lac-megantic/201307/10/01-4669313-plusieurs-travailleurs-ont-risque-leur-vie-sur-la-ligne-de-feu.php |title=Plusieurs travailleurs ont risqu\u00e9 leur vie sur la ligne de feu |author=CHRISTIANE DESJARDINS, DAVID SANTERRE et Gabrielle Duchaine |newspaper=La Presse |language=French |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter 20 hours, the centre of the fire was still inaccessible to firefighters<ref name=ctv /> and five pools of fuel were still burning.

Content of blended crude from multiple wells is not tested before loading, even though FRA indicates that \u201cit is critical that shippers determine the proper classification of the crude oil\u201d as a tanker with a higher safety classification (and not the standard DOT-111A car) is required for corrosive or explosive materials. The information is needed for provision to first responders and emergency services during a disaster.\n\nIn an increasing number of incidents, chemicals such as [[hydrochloric acid]] (used to release crude from oil well rock formations) have corroded tanks, covers, valves and fittings. As unit trains of tanker cars do not pass over weigh-in-motion scales in classification yards, many are overloaded, increasing risks of leakage as oil expands with temperature. The result has been twice the number of leaks from crude oil shipments as from alcohol shipments, the next highest hazardous material, even though comparable volumes of each travel by rail.<ref name=np-fra/>\n\nIn January 2014, Canada's Transportation Safety Board recommended that DOT-111 / CTC-111A oil-by-rail cars built before October 2011 be replaced with the newer, reinforced design.

There he began to develop real estate activities. In 1974, he convinced his father, then CEO, to change the focus of the company, sell the division of industrial construction to Quillery and use the money to enter fully into the business of real estate. Following that sale, Ferret-Savinel changed its name, becoming Ferinel, and, focused on the real estate market, began increasing its portfolio. In the 1980s, the company continued to grow, being one of the largest companies in the Paris property sector and serving as a springboard for Arnault's future endeavors, particularly with its acquisition of the textile company Groupe Boussac in 1984. In 1988, following this success, the headquarters were transferred from [[Roubaix]] to Paris and the real estate branch was renamed George V Group.<ref name=\"B2\">{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories |volume=66 |date=December 2004 |publisher=St. James Press |isbn=1558625119 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/internationaldir0066unse }}</ref>\n\n===CGE steps up===\nThe ''[[Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux]] (CGE)'' was established in the mid-19th century in order to provide water supply services to France's industrial cities. For the early 20th century, CGE was already one of France's largest private companies.\n\nThrough the first half of the century, CGE remained focused on its core water utilities operations. In the 1960s, however, CGE launched a new diversification strategy that led it into a variety of new markets over the next two decades, including the construction and real estate sales and development sectors. In 1979, the company increased this activity with the acquisition of Maison Phenix, a leading real state company. In 1988, CGE made another important purchase, obtaining the construction company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Entreprise (the future [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]]). In the 90s, during the French real estate crisis, CGE gathered all its residential real estate and development activities in a new subsidiary, called MI SA, which soon begun to be the leader of the French housing market.\n\nIn 1995, CGE bought the George V real estate division from Groupe Arnault.<ref name=B2/>\n\n===CGE restructure: CGIS era===\nCGE became a giant company, with a wide range of activities (construction, telecommunications, pay television, facilities management, the operation of amusement parks, and others), but the incompatibity between its real estate and construction components led it into a crisis in the mid-1990s. CGE was restructured and the construction sector was formed into a separate company, Vinci. In 1996, the real estate branch was also reorganised into a sole subsidiary, Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Immobilier et de Services (CGIS).<ref name=\"B1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/temp/2007/06/30/04011-20070630ARTFIG90855-alain_dinin_le_chti_devenu_roi_des_promoteurs.php |title=Alain Dinin, le \" chti \" devenu roi des promoteurs  |author=Lentschner, Keren |work=lefigaro.fr |publisher=[[Le Figaro]] |date=14 October 2007 |language= French |trans-title=Alain Dinin, the \"Northerner\" who became king of promoters |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> The lack of coordination between different areas, however, continued. CGIS had to sell many assets to stay afloat and CGE finally decided to separate from the real estate area, adopt the name [[Vivendi]], and refocus itself as a media and communications firm. CGIS and MI were apart soon after.<ref name=\"B2\"/>\n\n===European expansion and refocus: Nexity era===\nAs a new independent company, CGIS difficulties continued. It sold its hotels to [[Accor]] and [[Pierre & Vacances]] and a number of its [[La D\u00e9fense]] buildings to [[Unibail]]. In 2000 CGIS was sold in a management buyout backed by [[CDC Ixis Capital]], [[LBO France]], and [[Lehman Brothers]], changing its name to Nexity. In 2001, was created the [[Spain|Spanish]] subsidiary (even though operations there were made with French property since the 1990s), as well as the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. In 2002, was established Nexity [[Belgium]]. In 2003, Nexity separate itself from its engineering services branch, Cotebo, in order to focus on property services and development.

There he began to develop real estate activities. In 1974, he convinced his father, then CEO, to change the focus of the company, sell the division of industrial construction to Quillery and use the money to enter fully into the business of real estate. Following that sale, Ferret-Savinel changed its name, becoming Ferinel, and, focused on the real estate market, began increasing its portfolio. In the 80's, the company continued to grow, being one of the largest companies in the Paris property sector and serving as a springboard for Arnault's future endeavors, particularly with its acquisition of the textile company Groupe Boussac in 1984. In 1988, following this success, the headquarters were transferred from [[Roubaix]] to Paris and the real estate branch was renamed George V Group.<ref name=\"B2\">{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories |volume=66 |date=December 2004 |publisher=St. James Press |isbn=1558625119 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/internationaldir0066unse }}</ref>\n\n===CGE steps up===\nThe ''[[Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux]] (CGE)'' was established in the mid-19th century in order to provide water supply services to France's industrial cities. For the early 20th century, CGE was already one of France's largest private companies.\n\nThrough the first half of the century, CGE remained focused on its core water utilities operations. In the 1960s, however, CGE launched a new diversification strategy that led it into a variety of new markets over the next two decades, including the construction and real estate sales and development sectors. In 1979, the company increased this activity with the acquisition of Maison Phenix, a leading real state company. In 1988, CGE made another important purchase, obtaining the construction company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Entreprise (the future [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]]). In the 90s, during the French real estate crisis, CGE gathered all its residential real estate and development activities in a new subsidiary, called MI SA, which soon begun to be the leader of the French housing market.\n\nIn 1995, CGE bought the George V real estate division from Groupe Arnault.<ref name=B2/>\n\n===CGE restructure: CGIS era===\nCGE became a giant company, with a wide range of activities (construction, telecommunications, pay television, facilities management, the operation of amusement parks, and others), but the incompatibity between its real estate and construction components led it into a crisis in the mid-90's. CGE was restructured and the construction sector was formed into a separate company, Vinci. In 1996, the real estate branch was also reorganised into a sole subsidiary, Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Immobilier et de Services (CGIS).<ref name=\"B1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/temp/2007/06/30/04011-20070630ARTFIG90855-alain_dinin_le_chti_devenu_roi_des_promoteurs.php |title=Alain Dinin, le \" chti \" devenu roi des promoteurs  |author=Lentschner, Keren |work=lefigaro.fr |publisher=[[Le Figaro]] |date=14 October 2007 |language= French |trans-title=Alain Dinin, the \"Northerner\" who became king of promoters |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> The lack of coordination between different areas, however, continued.

It sold its hotels to [[Accor]] and [[Pierre & Vacances]] and a number of its [[La D\u00e9fense]] buildings to [[Unibail]]. In 2000 CGIS was sold in a management buyout backed by [[CDC Ixis Capital]], [[LBO France]], and [[Lehman Brothers]], changing its name to Nexity. In 2001, was created the [[Spain|Spanish]] subsidiary (even though operations there were made with French property since the 90's), as well as the [[Portugal|Portuguese]].

One of the first artistic styles to receive critic attention was Venda sculpting because it aesthetically appealed to white patrons while also maintaining its \u201cartistic manifestations of ethnic diversity.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> These sculptures would be considered \u201ctransitional art\u201d rather than \u201ccraft\u201d and would gain access into fine art galleries. Other Black artistic expressions such as beadwork, photography, and studio arts have also begun to be slowly integrated into canonical South African art forms.\n\nThe Johannesburg Biennale\u2019s ''Africus'' (1995) and ''Trade Routes'' (1997) had a significant impact on the cultural awareness of new South African art.

International pressure has been said to once again demand a level of \u2018authenticity\u2019 within South African art that portrays discourse on the topic of apartheid. Scholar Victoria Rovine goes as far as to state that \u201cthese exhibitions represent a South Africa that seeks liberation not from apartheid itself but from apartheid as an already predictable subject for artistic production.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, although South African art is not always political, conversations stemming from its interpretation are rarely apolitical and the high demand for apartheid symbols by private collectors have raised concerns over the collection of the art for the sake of nostalgia. <ref>Ross, D.

A charcoal and oil on canvas work by leading South African contemporary artist [[William Kentridge]] was sold on auction for R3,5&nbsp;million in London in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Contemporary South African Artists|url=http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-contemporary-south-african-artists|publisher=South Africa.net|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Art 21, Inc|url=http://www.art21.org/artists/william-kentridge|website=Art 21|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Black Art Post-Apartheid ==\nDue the Bantu Education Act of 1955, Black South Africans were barred from receiving formal art training during the years of apartheid and as a result, the artistic movements that had originated from this community have, until recently, been distinctly classified as \u201ccraft\u201d rather than \u201cart.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marschall|first=Sabine|date=21/2001|title=Strategies of Accommodation: Toward an Inclusive Canon of South African Art|journal=Art Journal|volume=60|issue=1|pages=50\u201359|doi=10.2307/778045|jstor=778045}}</ref> Informal art centers, that were funded by European states, became one of the few avenues in which Black South Africans could receive some form of artistic development. Throughout this time period from 1947 to the mid-90's, the first practitioners to receive this informal training began passing down their knowledge to younger generations of practitioners.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 43635180|title = South African Art in the Global Context|journal = Pr\u00e9sence Africaine|issue = 167/168|pages = 119\u2013126|last1 = Koloane|first1 = David|year = 2003}}</ref> However, the traditional canon of African art, categorized as \u201cfine art\u201d had been formed in the 20th century by European and U.S. art audiences.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rovine|first=Victoria L.|date=December 2004|title=South Africa from North America: Exporting Identities through Art|journal=African Arts|volume=37|issue=4|pages=48\u201395|doi=10.1162/afar.2004.37.4.48|issn=0001-9933}}</ref> South Africa\u2019s inequality gap is larger than that of other countries in the world so the audience for art is primarily the rich and not those who are subject to the artistic expression, giving these higher socio-economic groups a gatekeeper status in deciding what is classified as art.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klopper|first=Sandra|last2=Godby|first2=Michael|date=December 2004|title=Introduction|journal=African Arts|volume=37|issue=4|pages=16\u201317|doi=10.1162/afar.2004.37.4.16|issn=0001-9933}}</ref> After the Soweto Riots of 1976, a new social consciousness emerged that retaliated against the government\u2019s policy of segregation and effectively reexamined the classification of certain Black South African artworks. One of the first artistic styles to receive critic attention was Venda sculpting because it aesthetically appealed to white patrons while also maintaining its \u201cartistic manifestations of ethnic diversity.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> These sculptures would be considered \u201ctransitional art\u201d rather than \u201ccraft\u201d and would gain access into fine art galleries. Other Black artistic expressions such as beadwork, photography, and studio arts have also begun to be slowly integrated into canonical South African art forms.\n\nThe Johannesburg Biennale\u2019s ''Africus'' (1995) and ''Trade Routes'' (1997) had a significant impact on the cultural awareness of new South African art. These events were among the first exhibitions that revealed the \u201cnew South African art\u201d to the international community, but also other local South Africans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marschall|first=Sabine|date=June 1999|title=The impact of the two Johannesburg biennales (1995 and 1997) on the formation of a 'New South African art'|journal=Social Dynamics|volume=25|issue=2|pages=119\u2013137|doi=10.1080/02533959908458678|issn=0253-3952}}</ref> This gave Black South African artists a new platform to express the effects to which apartheid had influenced society. In the post-apartheid regime, artists have now been given an apparatus to protest social issues such as inequality, sexuality, state control over the personal realm, and HIV/AIDS.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the emphasis to embody many of these social issues within Black South African art has a led to a stereotype that many young artists are now trying to escape. International pressure has been said to once again demand a level of \u2018authenticity\u2019 within South African art that portrays discourse on the topic of apartheid. Scholar Victoria Rovine goes as far as to state that \u201cthese exhibitions represent a South Africa that seeks liberation not from apartheid itself but from apartheid as an already predictable subject for artistic production.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, although South African art is not always political, conversations stemming from its interpretation are rarely apolitical and the high demand for apartheid symbols by private collectors have raised concerns over the collection of the art for the sake of nostalgia. <ref>Ross, D.
