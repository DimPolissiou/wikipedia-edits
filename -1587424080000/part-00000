proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they '''did''' '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the [[Cabinet Office]], [[Chloe Smith]], issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward [[Primary and secondary legislation|primary legislation]] to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-03-24/HCWS183/|title=Update: Strengthening Democracy:Written statement - HCWS183|website=UK Parliament|language=English|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"271\">\nFile:WalesParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|'''2010'''\nFile:WalesParliamentaryConstituency2015Results.svg|'''2015'''\nFile:Wales Parliamentary Constituency 2017 Results.svg|'''2017'''\nFile:Wales Parliamentary Constituency 201911 with affilation changes.svg|'''2019 by-elections'''\nFile:Dec2019WalesConstituencies.png|'''December 2019'''  \n</gallery>\n\nThese are maps of the results of the last three general elections in Wales and changes in 2019 following a by-election and a change of affiliation.\n* [[Red]] represents the [[Welsh Labour|Labour Party's]] MPs.\n* [[Blue]] represents the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservative Party's]] MPs.\n* [[Amber (color)|Amber]] represents the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats']] MPs.\n* [[Green]] represents [[Plaid Cymru|Plaid Cymru's]] MPs.\n* [[Grey]] represents [[Independent politician|Independent]] MPs.\n\n=== 2019 by-elections ===\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Two [[By-election|by-elections]] were held in 2019:\n\n* [[2019 Newport West by-election]]\n* [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Clwyd]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Dyfed]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Gwent]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Gwynedd]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Mid Glamorgan]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Powys]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in South Glamorgan]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in West Glamorgan]]\n*[[National Assembly for Wales constituencies and electoral regions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{UK constituencies}}\n{{Constituencies in Wales}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies in Wales]]\n[[Category:Wales-related lists|Parliamentary]]\n", "text_old": "{{use Welsh English|date=August 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{short description|wikimedia list article}}\n\n[[Wales]] is divided into forty [[United Kingdom constituencies|Parliamentary constituencies]] which elect [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they '''did''' '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the [[Cabinet Office]], [[Chloe Smith]], issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward [[Primary and secondary legislation|primary legislation]] to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-03-24/HCWS183/|title=Update: Strengthening Democracy:Written statement - HCWS183|website=UK Parliament|language=English|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"271\">\nFile:WalesParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|'''2010'''\nFile:WalesParliamentaryConstituency2015Results.svg|'''2015'''\nFile:Wales Parliamentary Constituency 2017 Results.svg|'''2017'''\nFile:Wales Parliamentary Constituency 201911 with affilation changes.svg|'''2019 by-elections'''\nFile:Dec2019WalesConstituencies.png|'''December 2019'''  \n</gallery>\n\nThese are maps of the results of the last three general elections in Wales and changes in 2019 following a by-election and a change of affiliation.\n* [[Red]] represents the [[Welsh Labour|Labour Party's]] MPs.\n* [[Blue]] represents the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservative Party's]] MPs.\n* [[Amber (color)|Amber]] represents the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats']] MPs.\n* [[Green]] represents [[Plaid Cymru|Plaid Cymru's]] MPs.\n* [[Grey]] represents [[Independent politician|Independent]] MPs.\n\n=== 2019 by-elections ===\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Two [[By-election|by-elections]] were held in 2019:\n\n* [[2019 Newport West by-election]]\n* [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Clwyd]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Dyfed]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Gwent]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Gwynedd]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Mid Glamorgan]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Powys]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in South Glamorgan]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in West Glamorgan]]\n*[[National Assembly for Wales constituencies and electoral regions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{UK constituencies}}\n{{Constituencies in Wales}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies in Wales| ]]\n[[Category:Wales-related lists|Parliamentary]]\n", "name_user": "Benawu2", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Wales"}

Throughout these decades the synagogue functioned not only as a house of worship but as an agency for acculturation, a place to welcome new Americans. Before the settlement houses were established and long afterward, poor people could come to be fed, secure a loan, learn about job and housing opportunities, and make arrangements to care for the sick and the dying. The synagogue was, in this sense, a mutual aid society.\n\nFor fifty years, the synagogue flourished. Then membership began to dwindle as members moved to other areas, [[National Origins Quota Act|immigration quotas]] limited the number of new arrivals, and the [[Great Depression]] affected the congregants' fortunes. The exquisite main sanctuary was used less and less from the 1930s on. By the 1950s, with the rain leaking in and inner stairs unsound, the congregants cordoned off the sanctuary.\n\nWithout the resources needed to heat and maintain the sanctuary, they chose to worship downstairs in the more intimate [[beth midrash]] (study hall). The main sanctuary remained empty for twenty-five years, from approximately 1955 to 1980.  In 1986 the non-sectarian, not-for-profit Eldridge Street Project was founded to restore the synagogue and renew it with educational and cultural programs.<ref name=\"Santos\"/> [[Paul P. E.

Throughout these decades the synagogue functioned not only as a house of worship but as an agency for acculturation, a place to welcome new Americans. Before the settlement houses were established and long afterward, poor people could come to be fed, secure a loan, learn about job and housing opportunities, and make arrangements to care for the sick and the dying. The synagogue was, in this sense, a mutual aid society.\n\nFor fifty years, the synagogue flourished. Then membership began to dwindle as members moved to other areas, [[National Origins Quota Act|immigration quotas]] limited the number of new arrivals, and the [[Great Depression]] affected the congregants' fortunes. The exquisite main sanctuary was used less and less from the 1930s on. By the 1950s, with the rain leaking in and inner stairs unsound, the congregants cordoned off the sanctuary.\n\nWithout the resources needed to heat and maintain the sanctuary, they chose to worship downstairs in the more intimate [[beth midrash]] (study hall). The main sanctuary remained empty for twenty-five years, from approximately 1955 to 1980.

As on all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips ([[embouchure]]) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models ''also'' use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]] and [[superbone]] have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.\n\nThe word \"trombone\" derives from Italian ''tromba'' (trumpet) and ''-one'' (a suffix meaning \"large\"), so the name means \"large trumpet\". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the [[Baritone horn|baritone]], in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the [[cornet]], the [[euphonium]], and the [[French horn]]. The most frequently encountered trombones are the [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]] and [[Types of trombones#Bass trombone|bass trombone]]. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B{{music|flat}}, an octave below the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and an octave above the pedal B{{music|flat}} tuba. The once common E{{music|flat}} [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]] became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B{{music|flat}} [[transposing instrument]], written in treble clef.\n\nA person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. <!--If you are here to change \"trombonist\" to something else, know that it is not at all original, and not all that funny. Don't be that guy.-->\n\n'''Bold text'''== Construction ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; caption: stuff; margin-right: 0; float: right\"\n|+ <big>Basic trombone anatomy</big>\n| [[File:Trombone-2.svg|120 px]]\n||\n# tuning slide\n# counterweight.             score from quiz:1/5\n# mouthpiece\n# slide lock ring\n# bell\n# knob/bumper\n# water key/spit valve\n# main slide\n# second slide brace/stay\n# first slide brace/stay\n# bell lock nut\n|}\n\nThe trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube bent into an elongated \"S\" shape. Rather than being completely cylindrical from end to end, the tube is a complex series of tapers with the smallest at the mouthpiece receiver and the largest just before the bell flare. The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the instrument. As with other [[brass instrument]]s, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a [[standing wave]] in the instrument.\n\nThe detachable cup-shaped [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] is similar to that of the [[baritone horn]] and closely related to that of the [[trumpet]]. It has the [[Venturi effect|venturi]]:<ref name=\"Friedman\">{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Jay |title=The German Trombone, by Jay Friedman |url=https://www.jayfriedman.net/articles/the_german_trombone |website=www.jayfriedman.net |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance greatly affecting the tone of the instrument and is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section.  The slide section consists of a [[leadpipe]], the inner and outer slide tubes, and the bracing, or \"stays\". Modern stays are soldered, while [[sackbut]]s (medieval precursors to trombones) were made with loose, unsoldered stays.<ref name=\"Campbell2004\">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Murray |last2=Greated|first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers|first3=Arnold|title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music|url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816504-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona/page/201 201]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fischer1984\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Henry George |title=The Renaissance Sackbut and Its Use Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMVxu1y9O0C&pg=PA15|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=1984|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-412-8|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 'slide', the most distinctive feature of the trombone (cf. [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]), allows the player to extend the length of the air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves known as stockings were developed during the [[Renaissance]]. These \"stockings\" were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a threaded collar to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.\n\nThe adjustment of intonation is most often accomplished with a short tuning slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker Fran\u00e7ois Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs and later in the century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation \"on the fly\" by subtly altering slide [[Position (music)|positions]] when necessary. For example, second position \"A\" is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position \"E\". Many [[types of trombones|types of trombone]] also include one or more [[rotary valves]] used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.\n\nLike the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of unchanging diameter. Tenor trombones typically have a bore of {{convert|0.450|in|mm}} (small bore) to {{convert|0.547|in|mm}} (large or ''orchestral'' bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the gooseneck to the bell, which is typically between {{convert|7|and|8+1/2|in|cm}}. A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.\n\n== History ==\n=== Etymology ===\n\"Trombone\" comes from the Italian word ''tromba'' (trumpet) plus the suffix ''-one'' (big), meaning \"big trumpet\".\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was \"[[sackbut]]\". The word first appears in court records in 1495 as \"''shakbusshe''\" at about the time King Henry VII married a Portuguese princess who brought musicians with her. \"''Shakbusshe''\" is similar to \"''sacabuche''\", attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent \"''saqueboute''\" appears in 1466.<ref name=\"Michault\">{{cite web |last1=Michault |first1=Pierre |title=Le doctrinal du temps pr\u00e9sent , compil\u00e9 par maistre Pierre Michault, secr\u00e9taire du tr\u00e8s puissant duc de Bourgoingne |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k70431s/f17.item |website=gallica.bnf.fr |accessdate=4 December 2018 |page=16 |language=FR}}</ref>\n\nThe German \"''Posaune''\" long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of the Trombone |last=Guion |first=David M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780810874459 |location=Lanham, Maryland|page=22}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nBoth towns and courts sponsored bands of [[shawm]]s and trombone. The most famous and influential served the Duke of Burgundy. The trombone's principal role was the [[Countertenor|contratenor]] part in a dance band.<ref>Herbert (2006), p.&nbsp;59.</ref> The sackbut was used extensively across Europe, from its appearance in the 15th century to a decline in most places by the mid-late 17th century. It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. With trumpeters, trombonists in German city-states were employed as civil officials. As officials, these trombonists were often relegated to standing watch [[tower music|in the city towers]] but would also herald the arrival of important people to the city. This is similar to the role of a military bugler and was used as a sign of wealth and strength in 16th century German cities.\n\nHowever, these trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the [[alta capella]] wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles. These performed in religious settings, such as [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Helen |title=Defining the City 'Trumpeter': German Civic Identity and the Employment of Brass Instruments, c. 1500 |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nComposers who wrote for trombone during this period include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and his uncle [[Andrea Gabrieli]]. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.\n\nWhen the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known as the \"trombone\",<ref name=\"Guion\">{{cite book |last1=Guion |first1=David |title=The Trombone: Its History and Music, 1697\u20131811 |date=1988 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |isbn=2-88124-211-1 |page=3 |quote=Many modern musicians prefer to use the word 'sackbut' when referring to the Baroque trombone.

Italian [[:it:trombone|''trombone'']] and German [[:de:Posaune|''Posaune'']]. The 17th-century trombone was built in slightly smaller dimensions than modern trombones and had a bell that was more conical and less flared.\n\nDuring the later Baroque period, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] used trombones on a few occasions. Bach used it in some of his [[cantata]]s, having written for four trombones (with the rare [[soprano trombone]] playing the [[cantus firmus]], which would normally be played on cornett).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Who says the c.f. was normally played by a cornet?}} Handel used it in the ''Death March'' from ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', ''[[Samson (oratorio)|Samson]]'', and ''[[Israel in Egypt (oratorio)|Israel in Egypt]]''. All were examples of an [[oratorio]] style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional \"Stadtpfeiffer\" or [[alta cappella]] musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Therefore, trombone parts were rather seldom given \"solo\" roles that were not interchangeable with other instruments.\n\n=== Classical period ===\n[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]] ''(1767), but he also used it in operas such as ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]] ''(1779) and ''[[Echo et Narcisse]]''.\n\nThe construction of the trombone changed relatively little between the Baroque and Classical period. The most obvious change was in the bell, slightly more flared.\n\nThe first use of the trombone as an independent instrument in a symphony was in the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1807) by Swedish composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kallai |first1=Avishai |title=Biography of Joachim Nikolas Eggert |url=http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |website=Musicalics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108151031/http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |archivedate=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the composer usually credited with the trombone's introduction into the symphony orchestra was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5 in C minor]] (1808). Beethoven also used trombones in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 in F major (\"Pastoral\")]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 (\"Choral\")]].\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n==== 19th-century orchestras ====\nTrombones were often included in compositions, operas, and symphonies by composers such as [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy|Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Berwald]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner]] among others.\n\nAlthough the trombone trio had been paired with one or two cornets during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, the disappearance of the cornet as a partner and replacement by oboe and clarinet left unchanged the trombone's purpose: to support the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings) where harmonic moving lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. But the introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon an additional tenor trombone replaced alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the [[Second World War]]. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid 19th century.\n\nTrombonists were employed less by cathedrals and court orchestras and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E{{music|flat}} bass trombone remained in military use until around the [[First World War]]. But orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, the most versatile trombone that could play in the ranges of any of the three trombone parts that typically appeared in orchestral scores.{{vague|date=December 2018}}\n\nValve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; although it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the valve trombone remained popular almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and [[Bohemia]]. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] scored for a valve trombone section.\n\n{{listen|type=music|title=Trombone solo|description=from [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Mahler's 3rd Symphony]], 1st movement (composed 1893\u20131896)\n|filename=Gustav Mahler - Trombone Solo from 3rd Symphony, 1st movement.ogg}}\n\nWith the [[ophicleide]] or later, the tuba subjoined to the trombone trio during the 19th century, parts scored for the bass trombone rarely descended as low as parts scored before the addition of either of these new low brass instruments.{{vague|date=December 2018}} Only in the early 20th century did it regain a degree of independence. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner's addition of a contrabass trombone in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and Gustav Mahler's and Richard Strauss' augmentation by adding a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.\n\n==== 19th-century wind bands ====\nTrombones have been a part of the large wind band since its inception as an ensemble during the French Revolution of 1791. During the 19th century wind band traditions were established, including  circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones where the bell section pointed behind the player's left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire, with few original compositions, that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz's 1840 [[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]], which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. The most notable was [[Arthur Pryor]], who played with the [[John Philip Sousa]] band and formed his own.\n\n==== 19th-century pedagogy ====\nIn the Romantic era, [[Leipzig]] became a center of trombone pedagogy. The trombone began to be taught at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Musikhochschule]] founded by [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. The [[Paris Conservatory]] and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, [[Karl Traugott Queisser]], was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers wrote works for Quiesser, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the ''[[Trombone Concertino (David)|Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra]]'', Ernst Sachse and [[Friedrich August Belcke]], whose solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser helped reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany. He championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler's tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.\n\n==== 19th-century construction ====\nSattler had a great influence on trombone design. He introduced a significant widening of the bore (the most important since the Renaissance), the innovations of ''Schlangenverzierungen'' (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare\u2014features still found on German-made trombones that were widely copied during the 19th century.\n\nThe trombone was further improved in the 19th century with the addition of \"stockings\" at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of [[F attachment tenor trombone|a valve]] that, intentionally, only was to be set on or off but later was to become the regular F-valve. Additionally, the valve trombone came around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{listen|type=music|title=\"Miss Trombone\"\n|description=1908 ragtime by [[Henry Fillmore]]; played by The Indestructible Military Band\n|filename=Fillmore, Henry - Miss Trombone (1911).ogg}}\n\n==== 20th-century orchestras ====\nIn the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] the trombone maintained its important place in the orchestra in works by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Leos Janacek]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Ottorino Respighi]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], and [[William Walton]].\n\nWith the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of large bore tenors and B{{music|flat}} basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.\n\n==== 20th-century wind bands ====\nDuring the first half of the century, touring and community concert bands lost their popularity in the United States and were greatly reduced in number. However, with the development of music education in the public school system, high school, and university concert bands and marching bands and became ubiquitous in the US. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==== Use in jazz ====\n{{further|List of jazz trombonists}}\nIn the 1900s the trombone assisted the bass or tuba player's job of outlining chords for the other instruments by playing a bass line for the higher-pitched instruments to improvise over. It was not until the swing era of the mid-1920s that the trombone began to be used as a solo instrument. Examples of early trombone soloists are [[Jack Teagarden]] and [[J.J. Johnson]].<ref name=\"Bernotas\">{{cite web |last1=Bernotas |first1=Bob |title=Trombone |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/trombone-by-bob-bernotas.php#.VERSjPBX-uY |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=4 December 2018 |date=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilken\">{{cite web |last1=Wilken |first1=David |title=The Historical Evolution of the Jazz Trombone: Part One |url=http://trombone.org/articles/library/evojazz1.asp |website=trombone.org |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century construction ====\nChanges in construction have occurred during the 20th century, such as the use of different materials; increases in mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions; and in types of mutes and valves. Despite the universal switch to a larger horn, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the popularity of the F-Attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century, orchestral trombonists used instruments that lacked a trigger because there was no need for one. But as 20th century composers such as Mahler became popular, tenor trombone parts began to extend down into lower ranges that required a trigger. Although some trombonists prefer \"straight\" trombone models without triggers, most have added them for convenience and versatility.\n\n=== Contemporary use ===\nThe trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, or trios, or trombone trios, quartets, or choirs. The size of a trombone choir can vary from five or six to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&B, [[ska]], and New Orleans brass bands.\n\n== Types ==\n{{Main|Types of trombone}}\n[[File:Detall de bucc\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The bell of a [[buccin]] (MDMB 369, 1800\u20131860) in the musical instrument collection of the [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\n\n[[File:Superbone.svg|thumb|250px|Superbone]]\n\nThe most frequently encountered type of trombone today is the tenor, followed by the bass, though as with many other Renaissance instruments the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide that is used to change the pitch. [[Valve trombone]]s use three valves (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a half-step, and the third valve by one and a half steps.\n\nA [[superbone]] uses a full set of valves ''and'' a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves operated by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the ''F attachment'', which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B{{music|flat}} to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A [[buccin]] is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Basic slide positions ===\n[[File:Wirth trombone slide position chart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Slide position chart (new system); most trombones are tenor trombones, like the valveless one in the middle.]]\n\nThe modern system has seven chromatic [[Position (music)#Trombone position|slide positions]] on a tenor trombone in B{{music|b}}. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795.<ref name=\"Weiner\">{{cite journal |last1=Weiner |first1=H. |title=Andr\u00e9 Braun's Gamme et M\u00e9thode pour les Trombonnes: The Earliest Modern Trombone Method Rediscovered |journal=Historic Brass Society Journal |date=1993 |pages=288\u2013308}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811 Joseph Fr\u00f6hlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A.<ref name=\"Guion 93\">Guion (1988), p. 93.</ref> To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered \"drawn past\" then current 1st).<ref name=\"Guion 93\" /> In the modern system, each successive position outward (approximately {{convert|3+1/4|in|cm|0|disp=sqbr}}) will produce a note which is one [[semitone]] lower when played in the same [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]]. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to \"bend\" the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | New system\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old system\n| \u2013 || 1 || \u2013 || 2 || \u2013 || 3 || 4\n|}\n\n=== Partials and intonation ===\n[[File:Trombone first position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone first position harmonic series, \"where additional overtones may be used to stretch the upper range a bit higher.\"<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n[[File:Trombone seventh position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone seventh position harmonic series.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nAs with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]] in the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B{{music|flat}} trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> (one octave higher than the pedal B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>), F<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fifth]] higher than the previous partial), B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fourth]] higher), D<sub>4</sub> (a [[major third]] higher), and F<sub>4</sub> (a [[minor third]] higher).\n\nF<sub>4</sub> marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] scale. A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh.  On the slide trombone, such deviations from [[intonation (music)|intonation]] are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have [[just intonation]] (see [[harmonic seventh]] as well for A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>).\n\nThe next higher partials\u2014B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a [[major second]] higher), C<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher), D<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher)\u2014do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> (a [[minor second]] higher) is almost exactly a [[quarter tone]] higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and F<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed [[Embouchure|facial musculature]] and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] can go even higher to G<sub>5</sub>, A{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>, B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and beyond.\n\n[[File:Trombone F slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone with F attachment slide position second harmonics.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nThe higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above).  A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F<sub>4</sub> (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B{{music|flat}} trombone. The note E<sub>1</sub> (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} B{{music|flat}} tenor trombone, requiring a full {{convert|2.24|m|order=flip}} of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> (the fundamental in first position) and E<sub>2</sub> (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce \"[[Falset (music)|falset]]\" notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.\n\n=== Pedal tones ===\n[[File:Trombone slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone slide position \"pedal tones\".<ref name=\"Orchestration\">{{cite book |last1=Kennan |first1=Kent |last2=Grantham |first2=Donald |title=The Technique of Orchestration |date=2002 |isbn=0-13-040771-2 |pages=148\u2013149}}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[pedal tone]] on B{{music|flat}} is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music while notes below that are called for only rarely as they \"become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality\" with A{{music|flat}} or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B{{music|flat}} on the bass trombone.\n\n=== Glissando === <!--[[False glissando]], etc., redirect directly here.-->\nThe trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true [[glissando]], by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />{{rp|151}}\n\n'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.<ref name=\"Herbert 40\">{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Trevor |title=The Trombone |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10095-7 |page=40}}</ref>\n\n=== Trills ===\n[[Trill (music)|Trills]], though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>5</sub>) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor's [[range (music)|range]].<ref>Herbert (2006), p. 43.</ref> Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nUnlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a [[transposing instrument]]. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a \"[[Crook (music)|crook]]\") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (''e.g.'' Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).<ref name=\"Palm\">{{cite web |last1=Palm |first1=Paul W. |title=Baroque Solo and Homogeneous Ensemble Trombone Repertoire: A Lecture Recital Supporting and Demonstrating Performance at a Pitch Standard Derived from Primary Sources and Extant Instruments |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/listing.aspx?id=4343 |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\nTrombone parts are typically notated in [[bass clef]], though sometimes also written in [[tenor clef]] or [[alto clef]]. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German [[Robert Schumann]] was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.\n\nAn accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B{{music|flat}} as well.\n\n=== Mutes ===\n[[File:Trombone Plunger.jpg|thumb|175px|A plunger in use]]\nA variety of [[Whispa mute|mutes]] can be used with the trombone to alter its [[timbre]]. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect. Mutes used in this way include the \"hat\" (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or [[plunger|toilet plunger]]), a sound featured as the voices of adults in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoons.\n\n== Variations in construction ==\n\n=== Bells ===\nTrombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between {{convert|7|and(-)|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, the most common being sizes from {{convert|7+1/2|to(-)|8+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The smallest sizes are found in small jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common in orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be as large as {{convert|10+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more, though usually either {{convert|9+1/2|or|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bell may be constructed out of two separate brass sheets or out of one single piece of metal and hammered on a mandrel until the part is shaped correctly. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.\n\n=== Valve attachments ===\nMany trombones have valve attachments to aid in increasing the range of the instrument while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. In addition, valve attachments make [[Trill (music)|trills]] much easier. Valve attachments appear on alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass trombones. It is rare on the alto, but when the instrument does have it, the valve attachment changes the key of the instrument from E{{Music|flat}} to B{{Music|flat}}, allowing the alto trombone to play in the tenor trombone range. Tenor trombones commonly have valve attachments, the most common being the [[F attachment|F-attachment]], which changes the pitch of the instrument from B{{Music|flat}} to F, increasing the range of the instrument downward and allowing alternate slide positions for notes in 6th or 7th position.\n\nBass trombones also very commonly have F-attachments, which serve exactly the same function as on the tenor trombone. Some single valve bass trombones have E-attachments instead of F-attachments, or sometimes there is extra tubing on the F-attachment to allow it to be used as an E-attachment if desired. However, many bass trombones have a second valve attachment instead, which increases their range downward even more. The most common second valve attachment is the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment, which changes the instrument's key to D when used in combination with the F-attachment (or D{{Music|flat}} if used with the less common E-attachment). There are other configurations other than the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment however.\n\nThe two valves on a bass trombone can either be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used in combination with the first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other.<ref>[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/faq/faq_text/valves.html Douglas Yeo FAQ: Bass Trombone Valve Systems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Contrabass trombones also can have valve attachments. Contrabass trombones in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D{{Music|flat}} respectively. Contrabass trombones in B{{Music|flat}} on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G{{Music|flat}}.\n\nThe most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the [[rotary valve]]. Some trombones have [[piston valves]] used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the [[Thayer valve]] or axial-flow valve, the [[Hagmann valve]], the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow due to the 90\u00b0 bend in most conventional rotary valve designs. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valve attachments\n|File:Thayer valve.jpg|The Thayer valve is an advanced, conically shaped rotary valve that has become very popular in recent trombone design due to the open air flow it allows. The Thayer valve bends the air flowing through the trombone as little as 25 degrees.\n|File:HagmannValve.jpg|The Hagmann valve is a rotary valve variation that has become popular in recent years. It was invented following the Thayer valve as a response to maintenance issues of the Thayer valve.\n|File:TriggerTrombone.jpg|The standard rotary valve, like the one seen on this tenor trombone, is the most common valve type seen on slide trombones today.\n}}\n\n==== Valves ====\nSome trombones have valves instead of a slide (see [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]). These are usually [[rotary valve]]s, or [[piston valve]]s.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valves\n|File:Valvetrombonephoto.jpg|A valve trombone\n|File:Trombone a six pistons-IMG 0853-black.jpg|A military 6-valve trombone, by Adolphe Sax. Paris, 1866\n}}\n\n==== Tubing ====\nMore often than not, tenor trombones with an [[Types of trombones#F attachment|F attachment]], or trigger, have a larger bore through the attachment than through the 'straight' section (the portion of the trombone through which the air flows when the attachment is not engaged). Typically, for orchestral instruments, the slide bore is {{convert|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} and the attachment tubing bore is {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}}. A wide variety of valve attachments and combinations are available. Valve attachment tubing usually incorporates a small tuning slide so that the attachment tubing can be tuned separately from the rest of the instrument. Most B{{music|flat}}/F tenor and bass trombones include a tuning slide long enough to lower the pitch to E with the valve tubing engaged, enabling the production of B<sub>2</sub>.\n[[File:Yamaha Trombone comparison of open and traditional wrap.jpg|thumb|Open wrap (left) and traditional wrap (right) F attachments]]\nWhereas older instruments fitted with valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (''closed wrap '' or ''traditional wrap''), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (''open wrap''), resulting in a freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks out from behind the bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.\n\n=== Tuning ===\nSome trombones are tuned through a mechanism in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning slide in the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion from the start of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning slide in the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.\n\n=== Slides ===\nCommon and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are {{convert|0.500|,|0.508|,|0.525|and|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a ''dual-bore'' configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are {{convert|0.481|\u2013|0.491|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.500|\u2013|0.508|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.508|\u2013|0.525|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.525|\u2013|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.547|\u2013|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|\u2013|0.578|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones.\n\n=== Mouthpiece ===\n[[File:Schilke 51C4 Trombone Mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|right|A tenor trombone mouthpiece]]\nThe mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player's ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the [[timbre]] of that tone, its [[Loudness|volume]], the instrument's [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] tendencies, the player's subjective level of comfort, and the instrument's playability in a given pitch range.\n\nMouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a [[jazz]] trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.\n\n=== Plastic ===\n[[File:The Trombone Show (color).JPG|thumb|upright|Quartet with plastic trombones]]\nInstruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass.<ref name=\"pBone\">{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Mike|title=pBone plastic trombone|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-instrument-reviews/71-brass/12744-pbone-plastic-trombone|website=Jazzwise Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|date = 2 May 2013|title = Korg UK takes on distribution of Tromba|accessdate = 12 July 2013|website = Musical Instrument Professional|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114137/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|archive-date = 5 May 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\n\n==== Germany and Austria ====\nGerman trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German ''Konzertposaune'' can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least {{convert|12|to(-)|24|in|cm|-1}}. The whole instrument is often made of gold brass, and its sound is usually darker compared with British, French or American designs. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed {{convert|10|in|cm}} in diameter.\n\nValve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B{{Music|flat}} trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German \"Quart-ventil\", built onto a B{{Music|flat}} tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B{{Music|flat}} or F for extended passages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.\n\nAs with other German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long [[water key]]s and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.\n\nSince around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling \"American trombones\" as well. Most trombones played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper.\n\n==== France ====\nFrench trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid\u201320th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around {{convert|0.450|in|mm|abbr=on}}, small bells of not more than {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the [[cornet]] or [[French horn|horn]]. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B{{music|flat}}, altos in D{{music|flat}}, sopranos in F, piccolos in high B{{music|flat}}, basses in G and E{{music|flat}}, contrabasses in B{{music|flat}}.\n\n== Didactics ==\nSeveral makers have begun to market compact B{{music|flat}}/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B{{music|flat}} is ''open'' when the trigger is ''not'' depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (\"Preacher model\") was marketed by [[C.G. Conn]] in the 1920s, also under the [[Wurlitzer]] label. Currently, B{{music|flat}}/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers G\u00fcnter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the [[Yamaha Corporation]].<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090428193549/https://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor</ref>\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nTrombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, [[Boston Musical Instrument Company]], [[E. A. Couturier]], [[King Musical Instruments|H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments]], [[James Warren York|J. W. York]], and [[C.G. Conn]].

As on all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips ([[embouchure]]) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models ''also'' use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]] and [[superbone]] have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.\n\nThe word \"trombone\" derives from Italian ''tromba'' (trumpet) and ''-one'' (a suffix meaning \"large\"), so the name means \"large trumpet\". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the [[Baritone horn|baritone]], in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the [[cornet]], the [[euphonium]], and the [[French horn]]. The most frequently encountered trombones are the [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]] and [[Types of trombones#Bass trombone|bass trombone]]. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B{{music|flat}}, an octave below the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and an octave above the pedal B{{music|flat}} tuba. The once common E{{music|flat}} [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]] became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B{{music|flat}} [[transposing instrument]], written in treble clef.\n\nA person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. <!--If you are here to change \"trombonist\" to something else, know that it is not at all original, and not all that funny. Don't be that guy.-->\n\n== Construction ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; caption: stuff; margin-right: 0; float: right\"\n|+ <big>Basic trombone anatomy</big>\n| [[File:Trombone-2.svg|120 px]]\n||\n# tuning slide\n# counterweight\n# mouthpiece\n# slide lock ring\n# bell\n# knob/bumper\n# water key/spit valve\n# main slide\n# second slide brace/stay\n# first slide brace/stay\n# bell lock nut\n|}\n\nThe trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube bent into an elongated \"S\" shape. Rather than being completely cylindrical from end to end, the tube is a complex series of tapers with the smallest at the mouthpiece receiver and the largest just before the bell flare. The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the instrument. As with other [[brass instrument]]s, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a [[standing wave]] in the instrument.\n\nThe detachable cup-shaped [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] is similar to that of the [[baritone horn]] and closely related to that of the [[trumpet]]. It has the [[Venturi effect|venturi]]:<ref name=\"Friedman\">{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Jay |title=The German Trombone, by Jay Friedman |url=https://www.jayfriedman.net/articles/the_german_trombone |website=www.jayfriedman.net |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance greatly affecting the tone of the instrument and is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section.  The slide section consists of a [[leadpipe]], the inner and outer slide tubes, and the bracing, or \"stays\". Modern stays are soldered, while [[sackbut]]s (medieval precursors to trombones) were made with loose, unsoldered stays.<ref name=\"Campbell2004\">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Murray |last2=Greated|first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers|first3=Arnold|title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music|url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816504-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona/page/201 201]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fischer1984\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Henry George |title=The Renaissance Sackbut and Its Use Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMVxu1y9O0C&pg=PA15|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=1984|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-412-8|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 'slide', the most distinctive feature of the trombone (cf. [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]), allows the player to extend the length of the air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves known as stockings were developed during the [[Renaissance]]. These \"stockings\" were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a threaded collar to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.\n\nThe adjustment of intonation is most often accomplished with a short tuning slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker Fran\u00e7ois Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs and later in the century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation \"on the fly\" by subtly altering slide [[Position (music)|positions]] when necessary. For example, second position \"A\" is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position \"E\". Many [[types of trombones|types of trombone]] also include one or more [[rotary valves]] used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.\n\nLike the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of unchanging diameter. Tenor trombones typically have a bore of {{convert|0.450|in|mm}} (small bore) to {{convert|0.547|in|mm}} (large or ''orchestral'' bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the gooseneck to the bell, which is typically between {{convert|7|and|8+1/2|in|cm}}. A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.\n\n== History ==\n=== Etymology ===\n\"Trombone\" comes from the Italian word ''tromba'' (trumpet) plus the suffix ''-one'' (big), meaning \"big trumpet\".\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was \"[[sackbut]]\". The word first appears in court records in 1495 as \"''shakbusshe''\" at about the time King Henry VII married a Portuguese princess who brought musicians with her. \"''Shakbusshe''\" is similar to \"''sacabuche''\", attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent \"''saqueboute''\" appears in 1466.<ref name=\"Michault\">{{cite web |last1=Michault |first1=Pierre |title=Le doctrinal du temps pr\u00e9sent , compil\u00e9 par maistre Pierre Michault, secr\u00e9taire du tr\u00e8s puissant duc de Bourgoingne |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k70431s/f17.item |website=gallica.bnf.fr |accessdate=4 December 2018 |page=16 |language=FR}}</ref>\n\nThe German \"''Posaune''\" long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of the Trombone |last=Guion |first=David M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780810874459 |location=Lanham, Maryland|page=22}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nBoth towns and courts sponsored bands of [[shawm]]s and trombone.

It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. With trumpeters, trombonists in German city-states were employed as civil officials. As officials, these trombonists were often relegated to standing watch [[tower music|in the city towers]] but would also herald the arrival of important people to the city. This is similar to the role of a military bugler and was used as a sign of wealth and strength in 16th century German cities.\n\nHowever, these trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the [[alta capella]] wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles. These performed in religious settings, such as [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Helen |title=Defining the City 'Trumpeter': German Civic Identity and the Employment of Brass Instruments, c. 1500 |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nComposers who wrote for trombone during this period include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and his uncle [[Andrea Gabrieli]]. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.\n\nWhen the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known as the \"trombone\",<ref name=\"Guion\">{{cite book |last1=Guion |first1=David |title=The Trombone: Its History and Music, 1697\u20131811 |date=1988 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |isbn=2-88124-211-1 |page=3 |quote=Many modern musicians prefer to use the word 'sackbut' when referring to the Baroque trombone.

Italian [[:it:trombone|''trombone'']] and German [[:de:Posaune|''Posaune'']]. The 17th-century trombone was built in slightly smaller dimensions than modern trombones and had a bell that was more conical and less flared.\n\nDuring the later Baroque period, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] used trombones on a few occasions. Bach used it in some of his [[cantata]]s, having written for four trombones (with the rare [[soprano trombone]] playing the [[cantus firmus]], which would normally be played on cornett).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Who says the c.f. was normally played by a cornet?}} Handel used it in the ''Death March'' from ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', ''[[Samson (oratorio)|Samson]]'', and ''[[Israel in Egypt (oratorio)|Israel in Egypt]]''. All were examples of an [[oratorio]] style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional \"Stadtpfeiffer\" or [[alta cappella]] musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Therefore, trombone parts were rather seldom given \"solo\" roles that were not interchangeable with other instruments.\n\n=== Classical period ===\n[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]] ''(1767), but he also used it in operas such as ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]] ''(1779) and ''[[Echo et Narcisse]]''.\n\nThe construction of the trombone changed relatively little between the Baroque and Classical period. The most obvious change was in the bell, slightly more flared.\n\nThe first use of the trombone as an independent instrument in a symphony was in the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1807) by Swedish composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kallai |first1=Avishai |title=Biography of Joachim Nikolas Eggert |url=http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |website=Musicalics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108151031/http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |archivedate=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the composer usually credited with the trombone's introduction into the symphony orchestra was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5 in C minor]] (1808). Beethoven also used trombones in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 in F major (\"Pastoral\")]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 (\"Choral\")]].\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n==== 19th-century orchestras ====\nTrombones were often included in compositions, operas, and symphonies by composers such as [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy|Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Berwald]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner]] among others.\n\nAlthough the trombone trio had been paired with one or two cornets during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, the disappearance of the cornet as a partner and replacement by oboe and clarinet left unchanged the trombone's purpose: to support the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings) where harmonic moving lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. But the introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon an additional tenor trombone replaced alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the [[Second World War]]. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid 19th century.\n\nTrombonists were employed less by cathedrals and court orchestras and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E{{music|flat}} bass trombone remained in military use until around the [[First World War]]. But orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, the most versatile trombone that could play in the ranges of any of the three trombone parts that typically appeared in orchestral scores.{{vague|date=December 2018}}\n\nValve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; although it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the valve trombone remained popular almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and [[Bohemia]]. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] scored for a valve trombone section.\n\n{{listen|type=music|title=Trombone solo|description=from [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Mahler's 3rd Symphony]], 1st movement (composed 1893\u20131896)\n|filename=Gustav Mahler - Trombone Solo from 3rd Symphony, 1st movement.ogg}}\n\nWith the [[ophicleide]] or later, the tuba subjoined to the trombone trio during the 19th century, parts scored for the bass trombone rarely descended as low as parts scored before the addition of either of these new low brass instruments.{{vague|date=December 2018}} Only in the early 20th century did it regain a degree of independence. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner's addition of a contrabass trombone in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and Gustav Mahler's and Richard Strauss' augmentation by adding a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.\n\n==== 19th-century wind bands ====\nTrombones have been a part of the large wind band since its inception as an ensemble during the French Revolution of 1791. During the 19th century wind band traditions were established, including  circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones where the bell section pointed behind the player's left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire, with few original compositions, that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz's 1840 [[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]], which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. The most notable was [[Arthur Pryor]], who played with the [[John Philip Sousa]] band and formed his own.\n\n==== 19th-century pedagogy ====\nIn the Romantic era, [[Leipzig]] became a center of trombone pedagogy. The trombone began to be taught at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Musikhochschule]] founded by [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. The [[Paris Conservatory]] and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, [[Karl Traugott Queisser]], was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers wrote works for Quiesser, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the ''[[Trombone Concertino (David)|Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra]]'', Ernst Sachse and [[Friedrich August Belcke]], whose solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser helped reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany. He championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler's tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.\n\n==== 19th-century construction ====\nSattler had a great influence on trombone design. He introduced a significant widening of the bore (the most important since the Renaissance), the innovations of ''Schlangenverzierungen'' (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare\u2014features still found on German-made trombones that were widely copied during the 19th century.\n\nThe trombone was further improved in the 19th century with the addition of \"stockings\" at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of [[F attachment tenor trombone|a valve]] that, intentionally, only was to be set on or off but later was to become the regular F-valve. Additionally, the valve trombone came around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{listen|type=music|title=\"Miss Trombone\"\n|description=1908 ragtime by [[Henry Fillmore]]; played by The Indestructible Military Band\n|filename=Fillmore, Henry - Miss Trombone (1911).ogg}}\n\n==== 20th-century orchestras ====\nIn the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] the trombone maintained its important place in the orchestra in works by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Leos Janacek]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Ottorino Respighi]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], and [[William Walton]].\n\nWith the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of large bore tenors and B{{music|flat}} basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.\n\n==== 20th-century wind bands ====\nDuring the first half of the century, touring and community concert bands lost their popularity in the United States and were greatly reduced in number. However, with the development of music education in the public school system, high school, and university concert bands and marching bands and became ubiquitous in the US. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==== Use in jazz ====\n{{further|List of jazz trombonists}}\nIn the 1900s the trombone assisted the bass or tuba player's job of outlining chords for the other instruments by playing a bass line for the higher-pitched instruments to improvise over. It was not until the swing era of the mid-1920s that the trombone began to be used as a solo instrument. Examples of early trombone soloists are [[Jack Teagarden]] and [[J.J. Johnson]].<ref name=\"Bernotas\">{{cite web |last1=Bernotas |first1=Bob |title=Trombone |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/trombone-by-bob-bernotas.php#.VERSjPBX-uY |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=4 December 2018 |date=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilken\">{{cite web |last1=Wilken |first1=David |title=The Historical Evolution of the Jazz Trombone: Part One |url=http://trombone.org/articles/library/evojazz1.asp |website=trombone.org |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century construction ====\nChanges in construction have occurred during the 20th century, such as the use of different materials; increases in mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions; and in types of mutes and valves. Despite the universal switch to a larger horn, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the popularity of the F-Attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century, orchestral trombonists used instruments that lacked a trigger because there was no need for one. But as 20th century composers such as Mahler became popular, tenor trombone parts began to extend down into lower ranges that required a trigger. Although some trombonists prefer \"straight\" trombone models without triggers, most have added them for convenience and versatility.\n\n=== Contemporary use ===\nThe trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, or trios, or trombone trios, quartets, or choirs. The size of a trombone choir can vary from five or six to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&B, [[ska]], and New Orleans brass bands.\n\n== Types ==\n{{Main|Types of trombone}}\n[[File:Detall de bucc\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The bell of a [[buccin]] (MDMB 369, 1800\u20131860) in the musical instrument collection of the [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\n\n[[File:Superbone.svg|thumb|250px|Superbone]]\n\nThe most frequently encountered type of trombone today is the tenor, followed by the bass, though as with many other Renaissance instruments the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide that is used to change the pitch. [[Valve trombone]]s use three valves (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a half-step, and the third valve by one and a half steps.\n\nA [[superbone]] uses a full set of valves ''and'' a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves operated by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the ''F attachment'', which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B{{music|flat}} to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A [[buccin]] is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Basic slide positions ===\n[[File:Wirth trombone slide position chart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Slide position chart (new system); most trombones are tenor trombones, like the valveless one in the middle.]]\n\nThe modern system has seven chromatic [[Position (music)#Trombone position|slide positions]] on a tenor trombone in B{{music|b}}. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795.<ref name=\"Weiner\">{{cite journal |last1=Weiner |first1=H. |title=Andr\u00e9 Braun's Gamme et M\u00e9thode pour les Trombonnes: The Earliest Modern Trombone Method Rediscovered |journal=Historic Brass Society Journal |date=1993 |pages=288\u2013308}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811 Joseph Fr\u00f6hlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A.<ref name=\"Guion 93\">Guion (1988), p. 93.</ref> To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered \"drawn past\" then current 1st).<ref name=\"Guion 93\" /> In the modern system, each successive position outward (approximately {{convert|3+1/4|in|cm|0|disp=sqbr}}) will produce a note which is one [[semitone]] lower when played in the same [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]]. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to \"bend\" the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | New system\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old system\n| \u2013 || 1 || \u2013 || 2 || \u2013 || 3 || 4\n|}\n\n=== Partials and intonation ===\n[[File:Trombone first position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone first position harmonic series, \"where additional overtones may be used to stretch the upper range a bit higher.\"<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n[[File:Trombone seventh position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone seventh position harmonic series.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nAs with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]] in the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B{{music|flat}} trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> (one octave higher than the pedal B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>), F<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fifth]] higher than the previous partial), B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fourth]] higher), D<sub>4</sub> (a [[major third]] higher), and F<sub>4</sub> (a [[minor third]] higher).\n\nF<sub>4</sub> marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] scale. A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh.  On the slide trombone, such deviations from [[intonation (music)|intonation]] are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have [[just intonation]] (see [[harmonic seventh]] as well for A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>).\n\nThe next higher partials\u2014B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a [[major second]] higher), C<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher), D<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher)\u2014do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> (a [[minor second]] higher) is almost exactly a [[quarter tone]] higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and F<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed [[Embouchure|facial musculature]] and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] can go even higher to G<sub>5</sub>, A{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>, B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and beyond.\n\n[[File:Trombone F slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone with F attachment slide position second harmonics.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nThe higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above).  A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F<sub>4</sub> (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B{{music|flat}} trombone. The note E<sub>1</sub> (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} B{{music|flat}} tenor trombone, requiring a full {{convert|2.24|m|order=flip}} of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> (the fundamental in first position) and E<sub>2</sub> (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce \"[[Falset (music)|falset]]\" notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.\n\n=== Pedal tones ===\n[[File:Trombone slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone slide position \"pedal tones\".<ref name=\"Orchestration\">{{cite book |last1=Kennan |first1=Kent |last2=Grantham |first2=Donald |title=The Technique of Orchestration |date=2002 |isbn=0-13-040771-2 |pages=148\u2013149}}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[pedal tone]] on B{{music|flat}} is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music while notes below that are called for only rarely as they \"become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality\" with A{{music|flat}} or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B{{music|flat}} on the bass trombone.\n\n=== Glissando === <!--[[False glissando]], etc., redirect directly here.-->\nThe trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true [[glissando]], by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />{{rp|151}}\n\n'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.<ref name=\"Herbert 40\">{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Trevor |title=The Trombone |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10095-7 |page=40}}</ref>\n\n=== Trills ===\n[[Trill (music)|Trills]], though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>5</sub>) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor's [[range (music)|range]].<ref>Herbert (2006), p. 43.</ref> Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nUnlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a [[transposing instrument]]. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a \"[[Crook (music)|crook]]\") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (''e.g.'' Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).<ref name=\"Palm\">{{cite web |last1=Palm |first1=Paul W. |title=Baroque Solo and Homogeneous Ensemble Trombone Repertoire: A Lecture Recital Supporting and Demonstrating Performance at a Pitch Standard Derived from Primary Sources and Extant Instruments |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/listing.aspx?id=4343 |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\nTrombone parts are typically notated in [[bass clef]], though sometimes also written in [[tenor clef]] or [[alto clef]]. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German [[Robert Schumann]] was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.\n\nAn accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B{{music|flat}} as well.\n\n=== Mutes ===\n[[File:Trombone Plunger.jpg|thumb|175px|A plunger in use]]\nA variety of [[Whispa mute|mutes]] can be used with the trombone to alter its [[timbre]]. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect. Mutes used in this way include the \"hat\" (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or [[plunger|toilet plunger]]), a sound featured as the voices of adults in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoons.\n\n== Variations in construction ==\n\n=== Bells ===\nTrombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between {{convert|7|and(-)|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, the most common being sizes from {{convert|7+1/2|to(-)|8+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The smallest sizes are found in small jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common in orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be as large as {{convert|10+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more, though usually either {{convert|9+1/2|or|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bell may be constructed out of two separate brass sheets or out of one single piece of metal and hammered on a mandrel until the part is shaped correctly. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.\n\n=== Valve attachments ===\nMany trombones have valve attachments to aid in increasing the range of the instrument while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. In addition, valve attachments make [[Trill (music)|trills]] much easier. Valve attachments appear on alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass trombones. It is rare on the alto, but when the instrument does have it, the valve attachment changes the key of the instrument from E{{Music|flat}} to B{{Music|flat}}, allowing the alto trombone to play in the tenor trombone range. Tenor trombones commonly have valve attachments, the most common being the [[F attachment|F-attachment]], which changes the pitch of the instrument from B{{Music|flat}} to F, increasing the range of the instrument downward and allowing alternate slide positions for notes in 6th or 7th position.\n\nBass trombones also very commonly have F-attachments, which serve exactly the same function as on the tenor trombone. Some single valve bass trombones have E-attachments instead of F-attachments, or sometimes there is extra tubing on the F-attachment to allow it to be used as an E-attachment if desired. However, many bass trombones have a second valve attachment instead, which increases their range downward even more. The most common second valve attachment is the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment, which changes the instrument's key to D when used in combination with the F-attachment (or D{{Music|flat}} if used with the less common E-attachment). There are other configurations other than the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment however.\n\nThe two valves on a bass trombone can either be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used in combination with the first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other.<ref>[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/faq/faq_text/valves.html Douglas Yeo FAQ: Bass Trombone Valve Systems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Contrabass trombones also can have valve attachments. Contrabass trombones in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D{{Music|flat}} respectively. Contrabass trombones in B{{Music|flat}} on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G{{Music|flat}}.\n\nThe most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the [[rotary valve]]. Some trombones have [[piston valves]] used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the [[Thayer valve]] or axial-flow valve, the [[Hagmann valve]], the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow due to the 90\u00b0 bend in most conventional rotary valve designs. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valve attachments\n|File:Thayer valve.jpg|The Thayer valve is an advanced, conically shaped rotary valve that has become very popular in recent trombone design due to the open air flow it allows. The Thayer valve bends the air flowing through the trombone as little as 25 degrees.\n|File:HagmannValve.jpg|The Hagmann valve is a rotary valve variation that has become popular in recent years. It was invented following the Thayer valve as a response to maintenance issues of the Thayer valve.\n|File:TriggerTrombone.jpg|The standard rotary valve, like the one seen on this tenor trombone, is the most common valve type seen on slide trombones today.\n}}\n\n==== Valves ====\nSome trombones have valves instead of a slide (see [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]). These are usually [[rotary valve]]s, or [[piston valve]]s.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valves\n|File:Valvetrombonephoto.jpg|A valve trombone\n|File:Trombone a six pistons-IMG 0853-black.jpg|A military 6-valve trombone, by Adolphe Sax.

Typically, for orchestral instruments, the slide bore is {{convert|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} and the attachment tubing bore is {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}}. A wide variety of valve attachments and combinations are available. Valve attachment tubing usually incorporates a small tuning slide so that the attachment tubing can be tuned separately from the rest of the instrument. Most B{{music|flat}}/F tenor and bass trombones include a tuning slide long enough to lower the pitch to E with the valve tubing engaged, enabling the production of B<sub>2</sub>.\n[[File:Yamaha Trombone comparison of open and traditional wrap.jpg|thumb|Open wrap (left) and traditional wrap (right) F attachments]]\nWhereas older instruments fitted with valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (''closed wrap '' or ''traditional wrap''), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (''open wrap''), resulting in a freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks out from behind the bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.\n\n=== Tuning ===\nSome trombones are tuned through a mechanism in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning slide in the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion from the start of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning slide in the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.\n\n=== Slides ===\nCommon and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are {{convert|0.500|,|0.508|,|0.525|and|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a ''dual-bore'' configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are {{convert|0.481|\u2013|0.491|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.500|\u2013|0.508|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.508|\u2013|0.525|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.525|\u2013|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.547|\u2013|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|\u2013|0.578|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones.\n\n=== Mouthpiece ===\n[[File:Schilke 51C4 Trombone Mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|right|A tenor trombone mouthpiece]]\nThe mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player's ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the [[timbre]] of that tone, its [[Loudness|volume]], the instrument's [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] tendencies, the player's subjective level of comfort, and the instrument's playability in a given pitch range.\n\nMouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a [[jazz]] trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.\n\n=== Plastic ===\n[[File:The Trombone Show (color).JPG|thumb|upright|Quartet with plastic trombones]]\nInstruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass.<ref name=\"pBone\">{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Mike|title=pBone plastic trombone|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-instrument-reviews/71-brass/12744-pbone-plastic-trombone|website=Jazzwise Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|date = 2 May 2013|title = Korg UK takes on distribution of Tromba|accessdate = 12 July 2013|website = Musical Instrument Professional|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114137/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|archive-date = 5 May 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\n\n==== Germany and Austria ====\nGerman trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German ''Konzertposaune'' can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least {{convert|12|to(-)|24|in|cm|-1}}. The whole instrument is often made of gold brass, and its sound is usually darker compared with British, French or American designs. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed {{convert|10|in|cm}} in diameter.\n\nValve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B{{Music|flat}} trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German \"Quart-ventil\", built onto a B{{Music|flat}} tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B{{Music|flat}} or F for extended passages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.\n\nAs with other German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long [[water key]]s and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.\n\nSince around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling \"American trombones\" as well. Most trombones played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper.\n\n==== France ====\nFrench trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid\u201320th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around {{convert|0.450|in|mm|abbr=on}}, small bells of not more than {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the [[cornet]] or [[French horn|horn]]. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B{{music|flat}}, altos in D{{music|flat}}, sopranos in F, piccolos in high B{{music|flat}}, basses in G and E{{music|flat}}, contrabasses in B{{music|flat}}.\n\n== Didactics ==\nSeveral makers have begun to market compact B{{music|flat}}/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B{{music|flat}} is ''open'' when the trigger is ''not'' depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (\"Preacher model\") was marketed by [[C.G. Conn]] in the 1920s, also under the [[Wurlitzer]] label. Currently, B{{music|flat}}/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers G\u00fcnter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the [[Yamaha Corporation]].<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090428193549/https://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor</ref>\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nTrombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, [[Boston Musical Instrument Company]], [[E. A. Couturier]], [[King Musical Instruments|H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments]], [[James Warren York|J. W. York]], and [[C.G. Conn]]. In the 21st century, leading mainstream manufacturers of trombones include [[Vincent Bach Corporation|Vincent Bach]], [[C.G. Conn|Conn]], Courtois, Edwards, [[Getzen]], Greenhoe, [[Jupiter Band Instruments|Jupiter]], Kanstul, King, Michael Rath, Schilke, S.E.

Initially, the control systems were based on purely analogue/discrete digital circuitry with patents filed in July 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&date=19830112&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP&CC=GB&NR=2101243A&KC=A&ND=4/ |title= Patent GB2101243 - Control system for a vehicle automatic gearbox |work=Espacenet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> All of these early AP twin-clutch installations featured a single dry clutch and multiplate wet clutch.

The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches shared the same plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission input shaft, along the same centre line as the engine [[crankshaft]]; when viewed head-on along the length of the input shaft, this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.\n\nThe second implementation uses two single-plate dry clutches \u2013 side-by-side from the perpendicular view but again sharing the centre line of the crankshaft.\n\nA later variation uses two separate but identically sized clutches.

The name of the transmission is 7-speed LDF Dual Clutch \"Doppia Frizione\" with shift characteristics variable via Drive Select Mode and all-wheel drive with an electro-hydraulic multi-plate clutch.\n\nThe car has three modes changed using the steering-wheel-mounted \"ANIMA\" or mode selector. The three modes are strada, sport, and corsa, each with faster shifts. Launch control raises the rotation speed to 4200 rpm before dropping the clutch. The Hurac\u00e1n upshifts automatically at redline, but not before running into the limiter for a fraction of a second. Using the paddles to call for earlier shifts knocks 0.1 to 0.2 sec off the figures.\n\n===Kia===\n[[Kia Motors]] has announced the application of the all-new seven-speed DCT to a production model for the first time, the new Kia Cee\u2019d GT Line, which made its global debut at the 85th Salon International de l\u2019Automobile in Geneva on 3 March 2015.\n\nCompared to the six-speed DCT currently used in the European-market [[Cee'd]] models, the new transmission is expected to deliver a fuel-economy improvement of 7% and a 5% improvement in 0\u201362&nbsp; mph acceleration times. Like most new DCTs, the new transmission features dual dry clutches and two input shafts, allowing for seamless torque delivery between shifts, as well as gear-jumping to the optimal ratio, should the driver ask for it. If that was to apply to the current [[Kia Forte|Forte]] K3 Koup or Pro[[Cee'd GT]] and [[GT line]], with its 204-hp/265&nbsp; nm 1.6L inline-four [[Gamma II]] T-GDI Turbo engine and also 133-ps/300&nbsp; nm 1.6L [[CRDi]] diesel engine, for example, that would raise its fuel economy from 24 mpg city/36 highway to about 26/39 while bringing its 7.4-second 0\u201360 run to about 7.0 seconds.\n\nThe new transmission is the first of its type from the brand and has been developed in-house by Kia's research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel-efficient than Kia's existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode.\n\nInnovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with an electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.\n\nThe hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kick down or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times.\n\nThe continuous power delivery of the DCT minimizes the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission's boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee\u2019d GT line.\n\nCombined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT's seven gears allow the GT Line's diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine's torque increased from 265 to 285 nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine's improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy.\n\nReduction of noise, vibration, and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT's development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.\nAfter the Cee\u2019d GT Line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.\n\n===BMW===\nIn January 2008, [[BMW]] introduced a dual-clutch transmission for their [[BMW M3|M3]] model, manufactured by [[Getrag]], embedding a DualTronic dual-clutch module from BorgWarner, and dubbed \"M double-clutch transmission\" (M DCT).

The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches shared the same plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission input shaft, along the same centre line as the engine [[crankshaft]]; when viewed head-on along the length of the input shaft, this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.\n\nThe second implementation uses two single-plate dry clutches \u2013 side-by-side from the perpendicular view, but again sharing the centre line of the crankshaft.\n\nA later variation uses two separate but identically sized clutches. These are arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along the length of the input shaft and crankshaft centre line), and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly. This latter clutch arrangement (unlike the other two variations) is driven by a gear from the engine crankshaft.\n\n==Suppliers==\n\n===BorgWarner===\n[[BorgWarner|BorgWarner Inc.]] supplies<ref name=AutoChannel/> wet dual clutches<ref name=AEI/> and electrohydraulic control modules ([[mechatronics]])<ref name=AMS/><ref name=AutoChannel/> for these dual-clutch transmissions, along with complete dual-clutch transmission and [[transaxle]] assemblies.

from the {{lang-de|Direkt-Schalt-Getriebe}}.<ref>{{citation|title=Volkswagen Service Training Manual 308 \u2014 02E 6-speed DSG}}</ref> It is used in all of their mainstream marques, including [[Volkswagen]],<ref name=AutoChannel/> [[Audi]],<ref name=\"AutoChannel\" /> [[SEAT]], [[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]], and [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]], and also its top-tier marque [[Bugatti]]. Audi originally used the direct-shift gearbox name, but now uses the name \"S tronic\" for its DCTs.<ref name=Eureka/>\n\nThe first ever series production DCT was the Volkswagen Group DQ250<ref name=DCTfactsVWAG/> six-speed dual-clutch transmission,<ref name=VMS/> with dual concentric wet multiplate clutches.<ref name=VMS/> It was produced at the Group's [[Kassel]] [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|plant]]<ref name=AMS/><ref name=AEI/> under exclusive license from BorgWarner<ref name=Eureka/><ref name=AutoChannel/> for use in transverse [[powertrain]] installations, of either [[front-wheel drive]] or [[four-wheel drive]] (4WD) layouts.<ref name=VMS/> The 4WD versions are fundamentally identical to the FWD versions, but the 4WD versions use an additional bolt-on power take-off unit to direct engine torque to the [[Haldex Traction]] rear axle. This DQ250 variant is used in a wide range of models: Volkswagen Passenger Cars ([[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf/Rabbit/Golf Plus]], Scirocco, [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]], [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], and [[Volkswagen Touran|Touran]]); Audi cars ([[Audi A3|A3]], and [[Audi TT|TT]]); SEAT cars ([[SEAT Ibiza|Ibiza]], [[SEAT Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[SEAT Altea|Altea]], and [[SEAT Toledo|Toledo]]); \u0160koda cars ([[\u0160koda Octavia|Octavia]] and [[\u0160koda Superb|Superb]]); and Volkswagen commercial vehicles ([[Volkswagen Caddy|Caddy]] and [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|T5 Transporter]]).\n\nA second variant of the DSG went into series production in 2008<ref name=VWAG7/>\u2014the DQ200. This unit has seven forward ratios,<ref name=VWAG7/> but the notable difference over the original DQ250 is the change from wet to dry clutches.<ref name=AEI/><ref name=VWAG7/> This variant uses two single-plate dry clutches, arranged in a tandem design (instead of concentrically) and therefore similar in size. The DQ200 is again for use in transverse applications, but is intended for use in smaller cars, with smaller-displacement engines that generate relatively low torque outputs.<ref name=AEI/><ref name=VWAG7/><ref name=DCTfactsVWAG/> When used in the latest Golf with the {{convert|90|kW|PS hp|0|lk=on}} engine, this new seven-speed DSG uses roughly 6% (5.9l/100&nbsp;km for the seven-speed DSG compared to 6.3l/100&nbsp;km with the six-speed manual gearbox) less fuel than the same engine with a manual transmission<ref name=VWAG7/> and up to 20% less than a conventional automatic transmission.<ref name=VWAG7/> The original DQ250 also remains available.\n\nVolkswagen Group subsidiary Audi AG have also developed an all-new DCT, the DL501, for use in longitudinal powertrains.<ref name=DCTfactsVWAG/><ref name=DCTfactsAudi7>{{cite web|title=Inside Audi's premium DCT |url=http://www.dctfacts.com/indusIn_pg3.asp |publisher=The Lubrizol Corporation |work=DCTfacts.com |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012031721/http://www.dctfacts.com/indusIn_pg3.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2009 }}</ref> Like the original transverse DQ250, this DL501 uses dual wet multiplate clutches, but unlike the DQ250, this variant uses seven forward ratios.<ref name=DCTfactsVWAG/> This DL501 variant made its debut in the [[Audi Q5|Q5]],<ref name=DCTfactsAudi7/> and also is used in the latest versions of the [[Audi A4#B8|A4 (B8)]]<ref name=DCTfactsAudi7/> and [[Audi S4#B8|S4 (B8)]].<ref name=DCTfactsAudi7/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5053499/2009-audi-s4-sedan-avant-revealed-ahead-of-paris|title=2009 Audi S4 Sedan, Avant revealed ahead of Paris|publisher=Audi AG|work=Jalopnik.com|date=23 September 2008|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602113316/http://jalopnik.com/5053499/2009-audi-s4-sedan-avant-revealed-ahead-of-paris|archivedate=2 June 2009}}</ref> It is also being considered for use in an all new [[Audi A6|A6]].<ref name=DCTfactsAudi7/>\n\nAfter the facelift in 2012, the Audi R8 uses a seven-speed S tronic.\n\nRicardo plc produces the seven-speed DCT for the {{convert|736|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} 2005 Bugatti Veyron EB&nbsp;16.4.<ref name=AMS/><ref name=Eureka/><ref name=DCTfactsRicardo/>\n\n===Lamborghini (VW GROUP)===\n[[Lamborghini]]'s first dual-clutch transmission is available in the [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n]] LP610-4 (2014\u2013present). The name of the transmission is 7-speed LDF Dual Clutch \"Doppia Frizione\" with shift characteristics variable via Drive Select Mode and all-wheel drive with electrohydraulic multiplate clutch.\n\nThe car has three modes changed using the steering-wheel-mounted \"ANIMA\" or mode selector. The three modes are strada, sport, and corsa, each with faster shifts. Launch control raises the rotation speed to 4200 rpm before dropping the clutch. The Hurac\u00e1n upshifts automatically at redline, but not before running into the limiter for a fraction of a second. Using the paddles to call for earlier shifts knocks 0.1 to 0.2 sec off the figures.\n\n===Kia===\n[[Kia Motors]] has announced the application of the all-new seven-speed DCT to a production model for the first time, the new Kia Cee\u2019d GT Line, which made its global debut at the 85th Salon International de l\u2019Automobile in Geneva on 3 March 2015.\n\nCompared to the six-speed DCT currently used in the European-market [[Cee'd]] models, the new transmission is expected to deliver a fuel-economy improvement of 7% and a 5% improvement in 0\u201362&nbsp; mph acceleration times. Like most new DCTs, the new transmission features dual dry clutches and two input shafts, allowing for seamless torque delivery between shifts, as well as gear-jumping to the optimal ratio, should the driver ask for it. If that was to apply to the current [[Kia Forte|Forte]] K3 Koup or Pro[[Cee'd GT]] and [[GT line]], with its 204-hp/265&nbsp; nm 1.6L inline-four [[Gamma II]] T-GDI Turbo engine and also 133-ps/300&nbsp; nm 1.6L [[CRDi]] diesel engine, for example, that would raise its fuel economy from 24 mpg city/36 highway to about 26/39 while bringing its 7.4-second 0\u201360 run to about 7.0 seconds.\n\nThe new transmission is the first of its type from the brand and has been developed in-house by Kia's research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D center. More fuel-efficient than Kia's existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode.\n\nInnovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with an electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.\n\nThe hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kick down or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times.\n\nThe continuous power delivery of the DCT minimizes the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission's boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee\u2019d GT line.\n\nCombined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT's seven gears allow the GT Line's diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine's torque increased from 265 to 285 nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine's improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy.\n\nReduction of noise, vibration, and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT's development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.\nAfter the Cee\u2019d GT Line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.\n\n===BMW===\nIn January 2008, [[BMW]] introduced a dual-clutch transmission for their [[BMW M3|M3]] model, manufactured by [[Getrag]], embedding a DualTronic dual-clutch module from BorgWarner, and dubbed \"M double-clutch transmission\" (M DCT). The same transmission is used in the second-generation [[BMW E89|Z4]] (the Sdrive35i and sDrive35is versions), and is an available option on the 335i (coupe, convertible), 335is and later 135i builds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borgwarner.com/en/News/PressReleases/BWNews/2008-10-09_BorgWarnerDualClutchTechShiftsIntoHightGearOnBMWM3.pdf|title=BorgWarner dual-clutch technology shifts into high gear on BMW M3|date=October 9, 2008|accessdate=4 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807110130/http://www.borgwarner.com/en/News/PressReleases/BWNews/2008-10-09_BorgWarnerDualClutchTechShiftsIntoHightGearOnBMWM3.pdf|archivedate=7 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nBMW released the new M3 ([[BMW M3#F80 M3|F80]]) and M4 ([[BMW M4#F82 M4|F82]]) with the seven-speed DCT in 2014.

The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no [[Synchromesh|synchronizing mechanism]] is needed. After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for [[Switcher|shunting locomotives]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dual Clutch Transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n", "name_user": "LynxOEG", "label": "safe", "comment": "I grammatically corrected some words", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-clutch_transmission"}
