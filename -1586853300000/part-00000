In the vicinity of Lightning Ridge, it is divided up into two informal members the underlying Wallangulla Sandstone Member which primarily consists of  red fine grained sandstone, light siltstone and grey claystone and is up to {{convert|30|m|ft}} thick while the overlying Coocoran Claystone consists of about 10 metres of claystone. The contact between the two units is sudden and unconformable. Discontinuous clay lens beds within the Wallangulla Sandstone Member near Lightning Ridge, referred to as the Finch Clay Facies, are one of Australia's primary sources of commercial precious opal, with many mines dug in the area. These deposits are also the primary source of fossils within the formation, a large proportion of which are preserved as semi-precious opalized [[pseudomorphs]]. The fauna found in lightning ridge indicates that the depositonal environment of the Finch Clay Facies was in near-coastal freshwater lagoons.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Surat Basin}}<!--even though it is pathetic, let an Aussie fix that please-->\n\n== Paleogeography ==\n[[File:Geology of Asia 100Ma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Australia was located near the South Pole in the Early and Middle Cretaceous<br>[[GPlates]] reconstruction for 100 Ma ([[Albian]]-[[Cenomanian]] and Early and Late Cretaceous boundary)]]\n[[File:90 Ma - Late Cretaceous paleogeography with known distribution of Arcellites disciformis indicated.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Paleogeography of the Turonian (90 Ma)<br>{{small|Original map by Ron Blakey}}]]\n== Fossil content ==\nIndeterminate avialan, euornithopod, and sauropod remains that were once misidentified as brachiosaurid are present in New South Wales, Australia.<ref name=\"cretaceousdistribution\" /> Euornithopod tracks are also present in New South Wales.{{cn|date=March 2020|I have categorised the formation as ichnofossiliferous, but this needs a reference}}\n\n=== Mammals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | '''[[Mammal]]s'''\n|-\n!

In the vicinity of Lightning Ridge, it is divided up into two informal members the underlying Wallangulla Sandstone Member which primarily consists of  red fine grained sandstone, light siltstone and grey claystone and is up to {{convert|30|m|ft}} thick while the overlying Coocoran Claystone consists of about 10 metres of claystone. The contact between the two units is sudden and unconformable. Discontinuous clay lens beds within the Wallangulla Sandstone Member near Lightning Ridge, referred to as the Finch Clay Facies, are one of Australia's primary sources of commercial precious opal, with many mines dug in the area. These deposits are also the primary source of fossils within the formation, a large proportion of which are preserved as semi-precious opalized [[pseudomorphs]]. The fauna found in lightning ridge indicates that the depositonal environment of the Finch Clay Facies was in near-coastal freshwater lagoons.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Surat Basin}}<!--even though it is pathetic, let an Aussie fix that please-->\n\n== Paleogeography ==\n[[File:Geology of Asia 100Ma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Australia was located near the South Pole in the Early and Middle Cretaceous<br>[[GPlates]] reconstruction for 100 Ma ([[Albian]]-[[Cenomanian]] and Early and Late Cretaceous boundary)]]\n[[File:90 Ma - Late Cretaceous paleogeography with known distribution of Arcellites disciformis indicated.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Paleogeography of the Turonian (90 Ma)<br>{{small|Original map by Ron Blakey}}]]\n== Fossil content ==\nIndeterminate avialan, euornithopod, and sauropod remains that were once misidentified as brachiosaurid are present in New South Wales, Australia.<ref name=\"cretaceousdistribution\" /> Euornithopod tracks are also present in New South Wales.{{cn|date=March 2020|I have categorised the formation as ichnofossiliferous, but this needs a reference}}\n\n=== Mammals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | '''[[Mammal]]s'''\n|-\n!

Assad had denied any involvement, however President Obama claims to have intelligence proving otherwise. No proof has been given to the public other than reports from key United States senators and representatives. As of 4 September 2013, the Committee on Foreign Relations approved an attack with a 10\u20137 vote.\n\nPresident Trump on April 6, 2017 ordered the first U.S. airstrike on the Syrian air force since the country\u2019s civil war began in 2011. US Navy warships USS Porter and USS Ross in the Mediterranean Sea launched dozens of Tomahawk missiles at Syria's Shayrat air base.  The strikes were in reaction to what Washington says was a sarin poison gas attack by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that killed at least 70 people in the Idlib region of Syria.  U.S. officials informed Russian forces ahead of the missile strikes, which Russian military were in Syria actively supporting and assisting al-Assad during Syria's civil war, and US air strikes avoided hitting Russian personnel. Trump, who authorized the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles from Navy warships in the Mediterranean Sea on an air base near Homs were in direct response to Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons in the town of Idlib on April 4, 2017. Following airstrikes were conducted on April 8, 2017 on the Syrian city that was the site of chemical weapons attack earlier.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, the President of the United States ordered the withdrawal of Us military troops stationed on the Syrian-Turkey border. This withdrawal of military support was ordered by the President with disapproval of the Pentagon and the US Intelligence community. The US President ordered the withdrawal of military troops under the premise that Turkey would not invade the region being held by Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF); however Turkey attacked the SDF within 24 hours of US military withdrawal from the region.\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Venezuela}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\nRelations with Syria have improved following the election of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]].

Rather the Syrian Arab Republic is considered as part of one vast Arab homeland, ''al-watan al-arabi''.\n\nSyria's relations with the Arab world were strained by its support for [[Iran]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], which began in 1980. With the end of the war in August 1988, Syria began a slow process of reintegration with the other Arab states. In 1989, it joined with the rest of the Arab world in readmitting [[Egypt]] to the 19th [[Arab League]] Summit at [[Casablanca]].\n\nThis decision, prompted in part by Syria's need for Arab League support of its own position in Lebanon, marked the end of the Syrian-led opposition to Egypt and the 1977\u201379 [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] initiatives toward Israel, as well as the [[Camp David Accords]]. It coincided with the end of the 10-year Arab subsidy to Syria and other front-line Arab countries pledged at [[Baghdad]] in 1978. Syria re-established full diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1989. In the 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf War]], Syria joined other Arab states in the US-led multinational coalition against Iraq. In 1998, Syria began a slow rapprochement with Iraq, driven primarily by economic needs. Syria continues to play an active pan-Arab role, which has intensified as the peace process collapsed in September 2000 with the start of the second Palestinian uprising ([[Second Intifada|Intifada]]) against Israel. Though it voted in favor of [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441|UNSCR 1441]] in 2002, Syria was against coalition military action in Iraq in 2003. However, the Syrian government accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 1483|UNSCR 1483]] (after being absent for the actual vote), which lifted sanctions on Iraq and established a framework to assist the Iraqi people in determining their political future and rebuilding their economy.

Most of this territory was returned to Israel after the signing of the July 1949 Armistice Agreement and declared Demilitarized Zones. However, the exact location of the border between the two states, ownership of portions of territory and the right of Israeli farmers to farm the land in the Demilitarized Zones on the Israeli side of the border remained in dispute and sparked intermittent fighting between Syria and Israel until the [[Six-Day War|1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Through the early 1950s the Syrians gradually retook de facto control of some of the territory ostensibly belonging to Israel (along the foot of part of the western escarpment of the Golan Heights north of the Sea of Galilee, along the north-eastern coast of the Sea of Galilee and the low ground below the southern escarpment of the Golan). In addition to the territorial dispute, small-scale fighting was also sparked by a dispute over Israel's right to pump water from the [[Jordan River]] and the Sea of Galilee (actually a fresh-water lake) for use in agricultural irrigation and drinking. From 1964 to 1966 the Syrians attempted to dig a canal that would divert the sources of the Jordan River before they entered Israeli territory\u2014thus drying up that portion of the River and dramatically reducing the water-intake of the Sea of Galilee to prevent Israel from using that water. This led to a period of escalated fighting as the Israelis sought to prevent this diversion project which threatened to severely damage their ability to provide fresh-water to their population and agriculture (attempts to negotiate a solution by UN mediators failed). In fact, escalation of incidents between Israel and Syria in late 1966 and spring 1967 was one of the prime causes leading to the crisis that precipitated the Six Day War.\n \nSyria was an active belligerent in the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War, which resulted in Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights and the city of [[Quneitra]]. On 19 June, a week after the war ended, Israel offered to return the Golan if Syrian would agree to a full Peace Treaty. However, Syria refused. From 1967 to 1973 there were sporadic bouts of fighting along the new border.\n\nFollowing the October 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|Arab\u2013Israeli War]], which left Israel in occupation of additional Syrian territory, Syria accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 338]], which signaled an implicit acceptance of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]]. Resolution 242, which became the basis for the peace process negotiations begun in [[Madrid]], calls for a just and lasting Middle East peace to include withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories (note: not all territories) occupied in 1967; termination of the state of belligerency; and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of all regional states and of their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n\nAs a result of the mediation efforts of then US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], Syria and Israel concluded a disengagement agreement in May 1974, enabling Syria to recover territory lost in the October war and part of the Golan Heights occupied by Israel since 1967, including Quneitra. The two sides have effectively implemented the agreement, which is monitored by UN forces.\n\nIn December 1981, the Israeli [[Knesset]] voted to extend Israeli law to the part of the [[Golan Heights]] over which Israel retained control. The UN Security Council subsequently passed a resolution calling on Israel to rescind this measure. Syria participated in the Middle East Peace Conference in Madrid in October 1991. Negotiations were conducted intermittently through the 1990s, and came very close to succeeding. However, the parties were unable to come to an agreement due to President [[Bill Clinton]]'s failure to consult with the Syrian President, [[Hafez al-Assad]] during the negotiating process, Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]'s backtracking on the issue of the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee and Syria's nonnegotiable demand that Israel withdraw to the positions it held on 4 June 1967 (which meant Israel would relinquish its claim to territory occupied by the Syrians in the early 1950s in contravention to the 1949 Armistice Agreement\u2014including the north-eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee). A major stumbling-block was that in response to Israel's demand that the entire Golan from the Jordan River to the outskirts of Damascus be demilitarized the Syrians demanded that Israel demilitarize all its territory to a similar distance from the new border. This was not acceptable to Israel as it would have effectively left all of northern Israel between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea (more than a quarter of Israel), including the entire length of Israel's border with Lebanon, completely defenceless. The peace negotiations collapsed following the outbreak of the second Palestinian (Intifada) uprising in September 2000, though Syria continues to call for a comprehensive settlement based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and the land-for-peace formula adopted at the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|1991 Madrid conference]].\n\nTensions between Israel and Syria increased as the Intifada dragged on, primarily as a result of Syria's refusal to stop giving sanctuary to [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant groups conducting operations against Israel. In October 2003, following a suicide bombing carried out by a member of Palestinian [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] in [[Haifa]] that killed 20 Israeli citizens, [[Israel Defense Forces]] attacked a suspected Palestinian militant training camp 15 kilometers north of [[Damascus]]. This was the first such Israeli attack deep inside Syrian territory since the 1973 war. Syria announced it would respond diplomatically, and asked the UN Security Council to condemn the Israeli action.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005 Israel and Syria engaged in private talks discussing an outline peace accord. These were successful at a technical level, but failed to gain adequate political support.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IB13Ak05.html|title=US force-marches Israel over Syria|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|date=13 February 2007|work=Asia Times|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHostility between Syria and Israel further increased following Israel's execution of [[Operation Orchard]] on 6 September 2007.

Lebanon was part of [[Ottoman Syria]] until 1926. The presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon dates to 1976, when President [[Hafez Al-Assad]] intervened in the [[Lebanese civil war]] on behalf of [[Maronite]] Christians. Following the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Syrian and Israeli forces clashed in eastern Lebanon. The late U.S. Ambassador [[Philip Habib]] negotiated a cease-fire in Lebanon and the subsequent evacuation of [[PLO]] fighters from West [[Beirut]]. However, Syrian opposition blocked implementation of the [[May 17 Agreement|17 May 1983 Lebanese-Israeli accord]] on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the February 1984 withdrawal of the UN Multinational Force from Beirut and the departure of most of Israel's forces from southern Lebanon a year later, Syria launched an unsuccessful initiative to reconcile warring Lebanese factions and establish a permanent cease-fire. Syria actively participated in the March\u2013September 1989 fighting between the Christian Lebanese Forces and Muslim forces allied with Syria. In 1989, Syria endorsed the Charter of National Reconciliation, or \"[[Taif Accord]]\", a comprehensive plan for ending the Lebanese conflict negotiated under the auspices of [[Saudi Arabia]], Algeria, and [[Morocco]].\n\nAt the request of Lebanese President [[Elias Hrawi|Hrawi]], the Syrian military took joint action with the Lebanese Armed Forces on 13 October 1990, to oust rebel Gen. [[Michel Aoun]] who had defied efforts at reconciliation with the legitimate Government of Lebanon. The process of disarming and disbanding the many Lebanese militias began in earnest in early 1991. In May 1991, Lebanon and Syria signed the treaty of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination called for in the Taif Accord, which is intended to provide the basis for many aspects of Syrian-Lebanese relations. The treaty provides the most explicit recognition to date by the Syrian Government of Lebanon's independence and sovereignty.\n\nAccording to the U.S. interpretation of the [[Taif Accord]], Syria and Lebanon were to have decided on the redeployment of Syrian forces from Beirut and other coastal areas of Lebanon by September 1992. Israeli occupation of Lebanon until May 2000, the breakdown of peace negotiations between Syria and Israel that same year, and intensifying Arab/Israeli tensions since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000 have helped delay full implementation of the Taif Accords. The UN declared that Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon fulfilled the requirements of [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]]. However, Syria and Lebanon claimed that UNSCR 425 had not been fully implemented because Israel did not withdraw from an area of the Golan Heights called [[Shebaa Farms]], which had been occupied by [[Israel]] in 1967, and which Syria now claimed was part of Lebanon. The United Nations does not recognize this claim. However, Lebanese resistance groups such as [[Hezbollah]] use it to justify attacks against Israeli forces in that region, creating a potentially dangerous flashpoint along the Lebanon-Israeli border.\n\nIn 2005, Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon after the assassination of Lebanese Sunni Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. In December 2008, The Syrian Embassy was opened in Beirut for the first time in history since both countries gained their Independence during the 1940s. In March 2009, Lebanon followed and opened its embassy in Damascus.

As of 4 September 2013, the Committee on Foreign Relations approved an attack with a 10\u20137 vote.\n\nPresident Trump on April 6, 2017 ordered the first U.S. airstrike on the Syrian air force since the country\u2019s civil war began in 2011. US Navy warships USS Porter and USS Ross in the Mediterranean Sea launched dozens of Tomahawk missiles at Syria's Shayrat air base.  The strikes were in reaction to what Washington says was a sarin poison gas attack by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that killed at least 70 people in the Idlib region of Syria.  U.S. officials informed Russian forces ahead of the missile strikes, which Russian military were in Syria actively supporting and assisting al-Assad during Syria's civil war, and US air strikes avoided hitting Russian personnel. Trump, who authorized the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles from Navy warships in the Mediterranean Sea on an air base near Homs were in direct response to Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons in the town of Idlib on April 4, 2017. Following airstrikes were conducted on April 8, 2017 on the Syrian city that was the site of chemical weapons attack earlier.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, the President of the United States ordered the withdrawal of Us military troops stationed on the Syrian-Turkey border.

Rather the Syrian Arab Republic is considered as part of one vast Arab homeland, ''al-watan al-arabi''.\n\nSyria's relations with the Arab world were strained by its support for [[Iran]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], which began in 1980. With the end of the war in August 1988, Syria began a slow process of reintegration with the other Arab states. In 1989, it joined with the rest of the Arab world in readmitting [[Egypt]] to the 19th [[Arab League]] Summit at [[Casablanca]].\n\nThis decision, prompted in part by Syria's need for Arab League support of its own position in Lebanon, marked the end of the Syrian-led opposition to Egypt and the 1977\u201379 [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] initiatives toward Israel, as well as the [[Camp David Accords]]. It coincided with the end of the 10-year Arab subsidy to Syria and other front-line Arab countries pledged at [[Baghdad]] in 1978. Syria re-established full diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1989. In the 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf War]], Syria joined other Arab states in the US-led multinational coalition against Iraq. In 1998, Syria began a slow rapprochement with Iraq, driven primarily by economic needs. Syria continues to play an active pan-Arab role, which has intensified as the peace process collapsed in September 2000 with the start of the second Palestinian uprising ([[Second Intifada|Intifada]]) against Israel. Though it voted in favor of [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441|UNSCR 1441]] in 2002, Syria was against coalition military action in Iraq in 2003. However, the Syrian government accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 1483|UNSCR 1483]] (after being absent for the actual vote), which lifted sanctions on Iraq and established a framework to assist the Iraqi people in determining their political future and rebuilding their economy. Currently, much of the Middle East has condemned Syria's handling of the civil uprising, with only a few countries in the Middle East supporting Syria, most notably Iran, Iraq and Lebanon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|China}}||<!--Date started-->1 August 1956||See [[China\u2013Syria relations]]\n\nChina recognized Syria's independence in 1946.

Most of this territory was returned to Israel after the signing of the July 1949 Armistice Agreement and declared Demilitarized Zones. However, the exact location of the border between the two states, ownership of portions of territory and the right of Israeli farmers to farm the land in the Demilitarized Zones on the Israeli side of the border remained in dispute and sparked intermittent fighting between Syria and Israel until the [[Six-Day War|1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Through the early 1950s the Syrians gradually retook de facto control of some of the territory ostensibly belonging to Israel (along the foot of part of the western escarpment of the Golan Heights north of the Sea of Galilee, along the north-eastern coast of the Sea of Galilee and the low ground below the southern escarpment of the Golan). In addition to the territorial dispute, small-scale fighting was also sparked by a dispute over Israel's right to pump water from the [[Jordan River]] and the Sea of Galilee (actually a fresh-water lake) for use in agricultural irrigation and drinking. From 1964 to 1966 the Syrians attempted to dig a canal that would divert the sources of the Jordan River before they entered Israeli territory\u2014thus drying up that portion of the River and dramatically reducing the water-intake of the Sea of Galilee to prevent Israel from using that water. This led to a period of escalated fighting as the Israelis sought to prevent this diversion project which threatened to severely damage their ability to provide fresh-water to their population and agriculture (attempts to negotiate a solution by UN mediators failed). In fact, escalation of incidents between Israel and Syria in late 1966 and spring 1967 was one of the prime causes leading to the crisis that precipitated the Six Day War.\n \nSyria was an active belligerent in the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War, which resulted in Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights and the city of [[Quneitra]]. On 19 June, a week after the war ended, Israel offered to return the Golan if Syrian would agree to a full Peace Treaty. However, Syria refused. From 1967 to 1973 there were sporadic bouts of fighting along the new border.\n\nFollowing the October 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|Arab\u2013Israeli War]], which left Israel in occupation of additional Syrian territory, Syria accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 338]], which signaled an implicit acceptance of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]]. Resolution 242, which became the basis for the peace process negotiations begun in [[Madrid]], calls for a just and lasting Middle East peace to include withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories (note: not all territories) occupied in 1967; termination of the state of belligerency; and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of all regional states and of their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n\nAs a result of the mediation efforts of then US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], Syria and Israel concluded a disengagement agreement in May 1974, enabling Syria to recover territory lost in the October war and part of the Golan Heights occupied by Israel since 1967, including Quneitra. The two sides have effectively implemented the agreement, which is monitored by UN forces.\n\nIn December 1981, the Israeli [[Knesset]] voted to extend Israeli law to the part of the [[Golan Heights]] over which Israel retained control. The UN Security Council subsequently passed a resolution calling on Israel to rescind this measure. Syria participated in the Middle East Peace Conference in Madrid in October 1991. Negotiations were conducted intermittently through the 1990s, and came very close to succeeding. However, the parties were unable to come to an agreement due to President [[Bill Clinton]]'s failure to consult with the Syrian President, [[Hafez al-Assad]] during the negotiating process, Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]'s backtracking on the issue of the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee and Syria's nonnegotiable demand that Israel withdraw to the positions it held on 4 June 1967 (which meant Israel would relinquish its claim to territory occupied by the Syrians in the early 1950s in contravention to the 1949 Armistice Agreement\u2014including the north-eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee). A major stumbling-block was that in response to Israel's demand that the entire Golan from the Jordan River to the outskirts of Damascus be demilitarized the Syrians demanded that Israel demilitarize all its territory to a similar distance from the new border. This was not acceptable to Israel as it would have effectively left all of northern Israel between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea (more than a quarter of Israel), including the entire length of Israel's border with Lebanon, completely defenceless. The peace negotiations collapsed following the outbreak of the second Palestinian (Intifada) uprising in September 2000, though Syria continues to call for a comprehensive settlement based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and the land-for-peace formula adopted at the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|1991 Madrid conference]].\n\nTensions between Israel and Syria increased as the Intifada dragged on, primarily as a result of Syria's refusal to stop giving sanctuary to [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant groups conducting operations against Israel. In October 2003, following a suicide bombing carried out by a member of Palestinian [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] in [[Haifa]] that killed 20 Israeli citizens, [[Israel Defense Forces]] attacked a suspected Palestinian militant training camp 15 kilometers north of [[Damascus]]. This was the first such Israeli attack deep inside Syrian territory since the 1973 war. Syria announced it would respond diplomatically, and asked the UN Security Council to condemn the Israeli action.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005 Israel and Syria engaged in private talks discussing an outline peace accord. These were successful at a technical level, but failed to gain adequate political support.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IB13Ak05.html|title=US force-marches Israel over Syria|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|date=13 February 2007|work=Asia Times|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHostility between Syria and Israel further increased following Israel's execution of [[Operation Orchard]] on 6 September 2007.

Lebanon was part of [[Ottoman Syria]] until 1926. The presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon dates to 1976, when President [[Hafez Al-Assad]] intervened in the [[Lebanese civil war]] on behalf of [[Maronite]] Christians. Following the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Syrian and Israeli forces clashed in eastern Lebanon. The late U.S. Ambassador [[Philip Habib]] negotiated a cease-fire in Lebanon and the subsequent evacuation of [[PLO]] fighters from West [[Beirut]]. However, Syrian opposition blocked implementation of the [[May 17 Agreement|17 May 1983 Lebanese-Israeli accord]] on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the February 1984 withdrawal of the UN Multinational Force from Beirut and the departure of most of Israel's forces from southern Lebanon a year later, Syria launched an unsuccessful initiative to reconcile warring Lebanese factions and establish a permanent cease-fire. Syria actively participated in the March\u2013September 1989 fighting between the Christian Lebanese Forces and Muslim forces allied with Syria. In 1989, Syria endorsed the Charter of National Reconciliation, or \"[[Taif Accord]]\", a comprehensive plan for ending the Lebanese conflict negotiated under the auspices of [[Saudi Arabia]], Algeria, and [[Morocco]].\n\nAt the request of Lebanese President [[Elias Hrawi|Hrawi]], the Syrian military took joint action with the Lebanese Armed Forces on 13 October 1990, to oust rebel Gen. [[Michel Aoun]] who had defied efforts at reconciliation with the legitimate Government of Lebanon. The process of disarming and disbanding the many Lebanese militias began in earnest in early 1991. In May 1991, Lebanon and Syria signed the treaty of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination called for in the Taif Accord, which is intended to provide the basis for many aspects of Syrian-Lebanese relations. The treaty provides the most explicit recognition to date by the Syrian Government of Lebanon's independence and sovereignty.\n\nAccording to the U.S. interpretation of the [[Taif Accord]], Syria and Lebanon were to have decided on the redeployment of Syrian forces from Beirut and other coastal areas of Lebanon by September 1992. Israeli occupation of Lebanon until May 2000, the breakdown of peace negotiations between Syria and Israel that same year, and intensifying Arab/Israeli tensions since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000 have helped delay full implementation of the Taif Accords. The UN declared that Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon fulfilled the requirements of [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]]. However, Syria and Lebanon claimed that UNSCR 425 had not been fully implemented because Israel did not withdraw from an area of the Golan Heights called [[Shebaa Farms]], which had been occupied by [[Israel]] in 1967, and which Syria now claimed was part of Lebanon. The United Nations does not recognize this claim. However, Lebanese resistance groups such as [[Hezbollah]] use it to justify attacks against Israeli forces in that region, creating a potentially dangerous flashpoint along the Lebanon-Israeli border.\n\nIn 2005, Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon after the assassination of Lebanese Sunni Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. In December 2008, The Syrian Embassy was opened in Beirut for the first time in history since both countries gained their Independence during the 1940s. In March 2009, Lebanon followed and opened its embassy in Damascus. On 19 December 2009, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Al-Hariri visited Syria, and stayed in Damascus for three days meeting with President Bashar Al-Assad & breaking the ice between the two sides.<ref>[http://english.sohu.com/20050801/n226521001.shtml New Lebanese Prime Minister visits Syria] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424162012/http://english.sohu.com/20050801/n226521001.shtml |date=24 April 2018 }}, 2005</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|North Korea}}||<!--Date started-->||\nSee [[North Korea\u2013Syria relations]]\n\nNorth Korea is one of Syria's closest allies.<ref name=\"Ramani Diplomat 2018\">{{cite web | last=Ramani | first=Samuel | last2=Diplomat | first2=The | title=North Korea's Syrian Connection | website=The Diplomat | date=27 February 2018 | url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/north-koreas-syrian-connection/ | access-date=17 February 2019}}</ref> In September 2015, the Syrian government paid tribute to [[Kim Il-sung]] in a ceremony for a new park in Damascus named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/09/01/Syria-builds-park-in-honor-of-North-Korea-founder-Kim-Il-Sung/3841441128895/|title=Syria builds park in honor of North Korea founder Kim Il Sung|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Oman}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Oman\u2013Syria relations]]\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Pakistan}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Pakistan\u2013Syria relations]]\n\nBoth countries were on the [[silk route]] through which civilizational exchanges took place for centuries, Islamic missionaries that introduced Islam after 711 AD were from [[Syria]].
