He was the commander of the [[3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division|3rd Brigade]] of the 1st Cavalry Division, and the Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Maneuver (later Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Support) of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in Germany. He deployed as part of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] to [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] from July 1996 to August 1997. He and the Rear Command Post staff were based in [[Slavonski Brod]], Croatia. Casey took command of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in July 1999.\n\nAfter relinquishing command of the division in July 2001, Casey served in a senior staff position in [[the Pentagon]] as the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5), the [[Joint Staff]] from October 2001 to January 2003. His next position was [[Director of the Joint Staff]] in Washington, D.C. from January 2003 to October 2003. Following these assignments, Casey was nominated and confirmed as the 30th [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Vice Chief of Staff of the Army]], serving in that post until June 2004.\n\n===Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq===\nCasey served as the senior coalition commander in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2007.

For his part as a military commander, he focused on training Iraqi forces, limiting the role of American forces, and transferring the burden for providing security to Iraqi forces. Meanwhile, [[Foreign Service Officer|U.S. diplomats]] would focus on building and strengthening the Iraqi government and help the Iraqis hold elections. He expressed his view that a large and intrusive American presence in Iraq would not solve the political and security problems in that country and could even fuel the insurgency.\n\nIn 2005, Casey was hopeful that the [[December 2005 Iraqi elections]] could lead to a more unified and moderate Iraq which\u2014in conjunction with the training of Iraqi security forces\u2014could pave the way for U.S. troop reductions in early 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070716/1a_iedcoverxx.art.htm|title=Pentagon balked at pleas from officers in field for safer vehicles- Iraqi troops got MRAPs; Americans waited |author=Peter Eisler, Blake Morrison and Tom Vanden Brook |work=USA Today |date=July 16, 2007}}</ref> In August 2005, Casey used specific troop numbers in his public discussion of a possible drawdown. He said the troop level of 138,000 could be reduced by 30,000 in the early months of 2006 as Iraqi security forces took on a greater role. President [[George W. Bush]] publicly called the talk \"speculation\" and rebuked the general. The bombing of the [[al-Askari Mosque]], a sacred [[Shia]] religious site in [[Samarra]], is believed to have stoked sectarian tensions and derailed coalition plans to speedily transfer significant security responsibility to the Iraqi government by the end of 2006.<ref name=Telegraph_20050814>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1496197/Bush-slaps-down-top-general-after-he-calls-for-troops-to-be-pulled-out-of-Iraq.html |title=Bush slaps down top general after he calls for troops to be pulled out of Iraq |accessdate=2010-01-30|author=Sherwell, Philip |date=August 14, 2005 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113130646/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fwirq14.xml&sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fixworld.html |archivedate=November 13, 2005 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, Casey implied his opposition to a [[troop surge]]:\n\n{{quote|... the longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias.

Casey officially succeeded General [[Peter Schoomaker]] as Chief of Staff of the Army on April 10, 2007.\n\nAs the 36th Chief of Staff of the United States Army from April 2007 to 2011, Casey led what is arguably the world's largest and most complex organization\u20141.1&nbsp;million people strong, with a $200+ billion annual budget\u2014during one of the most extraordinary periods in military and global political history. He became Chief of Staff of an Army that was stretched from 6 years of continuous war. Over his tenure he stabilized and transformed the army to meet the challenges of the 21st century while continuing to meet the demands of two wars. Casey transformed an army trained and prepared for conventional war, to an agile force more suited to modern challenges.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nCasey accelerated the growth of the army, instituted Retention Bonuses for young officers, increased the funding for soldier and family programs, improved the way the army cared for its wounded soldiers and surviving family members and drove down the stigma associated with behavioral health counseling to stabilize an army stretched by war. He also improved the leadership training for the army's General Officer Corps, advanced the transformation of the army's business and decision making processes, moved the army onto a rotational deployment program much like the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps']] and oversaw a substantial improvement in the capabilities of the Army National Guard and Army Reserves.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]] committed by United States Army psychiatrist [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], Casey expressed concern about jumping to conclusions before the investigation was completed, telling CNN's [[John King (journalist)|John King]] that \"this increased speculation could cause a backlash against some of our Muslim soldiers\" and \"As great a tragedy as this was, it would be a shame if our diversity became a casualty as well.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/08/casey-im-concerned-about-possible-backlash-against-muslim-soldiers/?fbid=N63XSrE7Gga |title=Casey: I'm 'concerned' about backlash against Muslim soldiers |date=8 November 2009 |publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> Several months later, in a February 2010 interview, Casey said: \"Our diversity not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.

His father commanded the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] in Vietnam and was killed on July 7, 1970, when his command helicopter crashed in [[South Vietnam]] en route to a hospital to visit wounded American soldiers.\n\nCasey, a [[military brat (U.S. subculture)|military brat]], grew up on army posts in the United States, Japan, and Germany and graduated from [[Boston College High School]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. After high school, he applied to West Point, like his father, but was unsuccessful. He went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[international relations]] from [[Georgetown University]] in 1970 and later a [[Master of Arts]] degree in international relations from the [[University of Denver]] in 1980.

He was the commander of the [[3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division|3rd Brigade]] of the 1st Cavalry Division, and the Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Maneuver (later Assistant Division Commander \u2013 Support) of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in Germany. He deployed as part of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] to [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] from July 1996 to August 1997. He and the Rear Command Post staff were based in [[Slavonski Brod]], Croatia. Casey took command of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] in July 1999.\n\nAfter relinquishing command of the division in July 2001, Casey served in a senior staff position in [[the Pentagon]] as the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5), the [[Joint Staff]] from October 2001 to January 2003. His next position was [[Director of the Joint Staff]] in Washington, D.C. from January 2003 to October 2003. Following these assignments, Casey was nominated and confirmed as the 30th [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Vice Chief of Staff of the Army]], serving in that post until June 2004.\n\n===Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq===\nCasey served as the senior coalition commander in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2007.

For his part as a military commander, he focused on training Iraqi forces, limiting the role of American forces, and transferring the burden for providing security to Iraqi forces. Meanwhile, [[Foreign Service Officer|U.S. diplomats]] would focus on building and strengthening the Iraqi government and help the Iraqis hold elections. He expressed his view that a large and intrusive American presence in Iraq would not solve the political and security problems in that country and could even fuel the insurgency.\n\nIn 2005, Casey was hopeful that the [[December 2005 Iraqi elections]] could lead to a more unified and moderate Iraq which\u2014in conjunction with the training of Iraqi security forces\u2014could pave the way for U.S. troop reductions in early 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070716/1a_iedcoverxx.art.htm|title=Pentagon balked at pleas from officers in field for safer vehicles- Iraqi troops got MRAPs; Americans waited |author=Peter Eisler, Blake Morrison and Tom Vanden Brook |work=USA Today |date=July 16, 2007}}</ref> In August 2005, Casey used specific troop numbers in his public discussion of a possible drawdown. He said the troop level of 138,000 could be reduced by 30,000 in the early months of 2006 as Iraqi security forces took on a greater role. President [[George W. Bush]] publicly called the talk \"speculation\" and rebuked the general. The bombing of the [[al-Askari Mosque]], a sacred [[Shia]] religious site in [[Samarra]], is believed to have stoked sectarian tensions and derailed coalition plans to speedily transfer significant security responsibility to the Iraqi government by the end of 2006.<ref name=Telegraph_20050814>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1496197/Bush-slaps-down-top-general-after-he-calls-for-troops-to-be-pulled-out-of-Iraq.html |title=Bush slaps down top general after he calls for troops to be pulled out of Iraq |accessdate=2010-01-30|author=Sherwell, Philip |date=August 14, 2005 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113130646/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fwirq14.xml&sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F08%2F14%2Fixworld.html |archivedate=November 13, 2005 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, Casey implied his opposition to a [[troop surge]]:\n\n{{quote|... the longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias.

Casey officially succeeded General [[Peter Schoomaker]] as Chief of Staff of the Army on April 10, 2007.\n\nAs the 36th Chief of Staff of the United States Army from April 2007 to 2011, Casey led what is arguably the world's largest and most complex organization\u20141.1&nbsp;million people strong, with a $200+ billion annual budget\u2014during one of the most extraordinary periods in military and global political history. He became Chief of Staff of an Army that was stretched from 6 years of continuous war. Over his tenure he stabilized and transformed the army to meet the challenges of the 21st century while continuing to meet the demands of two wars. Casey transformed an army trained and prepared for conventional war, to an agile force more suited to modern challenges.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nCasey accelerated the growth of the army, instituted Retention Bonuses for young officers, increased the funding for soldier and family programs, improved the way the army cared for its wounded soldiers and surviving family members and drove down the stigma associated with behavioral health counseling to stabilize an army stretched by war. He also improved the leadership training for the army's General Officer Corps, advanced the transformation of the army's business and decision making processes, moved the army onto a rotational deployment program much like the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps']] and oversaw a substantial improvement in the capabilities of the Army National Guard and Army Reserves.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]] committed by United States Army psychiatrist [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], Casey expressed concern about jumping to conclusions before the investigation was completed, telling CNN's [[John King (journalist)|John King]] that \"this increased speculation could cause a backlash against some of our Muslim soldiers\" and \"As great a tragedy as this was, it would be a shame if our diversity became a casualty as well.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/08/casey-im-concerned-about-possible-backlash-against-muslim-soldiers/?fbid=N63XSrE7Gga |title=Casey: I'm 'concerned' about backlash against Muslim soldiers |date=8 November 2009 |publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> Several months later, in a February 2010 interview, Casey said: \"Our diversity not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.
