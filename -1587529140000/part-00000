Unlike many of the [[Cornish rotten boroughs|boroughs in Cornwall]] which were represented in the [[Unreformed House of Commons]], Bodmin was a town of reasonable size and retained some importance; for most purposes, indeed, it was considered the county town of Cornwall. In 1831, the population of the borough was 3,375, and contained 596 houses.\n\nThe right to vote, however, was held not by the residents at large but by the town's corporation, consisting of a Mayor, 11 [[alderman|aldermen]] and 24 common councilmen. Contested elections were quite unknown before the Reform Act, the choice of the two MPs being left entirely to the \"patron\". However, this power did not arise, as in many [[rotten borough]]s, from the patron being able to coerce the voters; in Bodmin, the patron was expected to meet the public and private expenses of the corporation and its members in return for their acquiescence at election time.\n\nEarly in the 18th century, the Robartes family ([[Earl of Radnor|Earls of Radnor]]) were the accepted patrons. Their interest was inherited by [[George Hunt (MP)|George Hunt]], whose mother was the Robartes heiress, but he ran into difficulties and could not afford to retain complete control. By the 1760s another local magnate, [[William Irby, 1st Baron Boston|Sir William Irby]], secured enough of the town's goodwill to have a say in the choice of one member, while Hunt continued to select the other. In 1816, the patron was [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset|Lord de Dunstanville]], nominating both MPs, but he found himself so overburdened with debts that he was forced to give it up, and [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 2nd Marquess of Hertford|The Marquess of Hertford]] was induced to take over the patronage, and the corporation's debts.\n\nWhile the MP was not expected to assume the same financial obligations as the patron, nor to attend to the needs of his constituents in the manner of a modern MP, they were expected to attend the election ball, a high point in the social calendar for the wives and daughters of the otherwise undistinguished corporation members. [[John Wilson Croker]], elected in 1820, described the Bodmin ball as \"tumultuous and merry \" but \"at once tiresome and foolish\".\n\nBodmin retained both its MPs under the Reform Act, but its boundaries were extended to bring in more of Bodmin parish and the whole of the neighbouring parishes of [[Lanivet]], [[Lanhydrock]] and [[Helland]]. This increased the population to 5,258, although only 252 were qualified to vote.\n\nBy the time of the second Reform Act in 1867, Bodmin's electorate was still below 400, and consequently its representation was halved with effect from the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]]. The extension of the franchise more than doubled the electorate, but Bodmin was still far too small to survive as a borough, and was abolished in 1885.\n\n===County constituency (1885\u20131983)===\n[[File:Bodmin 1918-45.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Bodmin in Cornwall & Devon 1918\u20131945]]\nThe Bodmin constituency from 1885 until 1918, strictly called the '''South-Eastern or Bodmin Division of Cornwall''', covered the whole of the south-east corner of the county, including as well as Bodmin itself the towns of [[Liskeard]], [[Fowey]], [[Lostwithiel]] and [[Saltash]]. Although predominantly rural, the string of small ports along its coast gave it a maritime as well as agricultural character. Through most of this period the constituency was marginal, the Unionists being helped by the popularity of their candidate [[Leonard Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith|Leonard Courtney]], who had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP for [[Liskeard (UK Parliament constituency)|Liskeard]] when it was still a separate borough before joining the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] when the party split in 1886. [[Looe]] and the other fishing ports were predominantly Liberal and Fowey a Unionist stronghold, while the areas within the ambit of [[Plymouth]]'s dockyards tended to vote against whichever was the sitting government. Another factor was the strength of non-conformist religion, as elsewhere in Cornwall, and this was thought to be the explanation for the Liberal gain in 1906, when agricultural seats elsewhere mostly remained with the Tories.\n\nThe boundary changes at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], which established what was now called '''Cornwall, Bodmin Division''', and later '''Bodmin County Constituency''', extended the constituency somewhat towards the centre of the county, taking in [[Callington, Cornwall|Callington]] and the surrounding district. These boundaries remained essentially unchanged for the remainder of the constituency's existence, except that Fowey was moved into the [[Truro (UK Parliament constituency)|Truro]] constituency in 1974. As elsewhere in Cornwall, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] never established a foothold in Bodmin, and the Liberals remained the main challengers to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. The Conservatives held it continuously from 1945 to 1964, and at one point might have considered it a safe seat, but by the mid-1960s the Liberal revival had established it as a Liberal-Conservative marginal, which it remained until its abolition.\n\nThe Bodmin constituency ceased to exist as a result of the boundary changes implemented in 1983. Although the bulk of the constituency survived, Bodmin itself had been moved, enforcing a change of name: Bodmin joined [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]], while the rest of the constituency was reunited with Fowey to become [[South East Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cornwall]]. Bodmin's last Member, [[Robert Hicks (British politician)|Robert Hicks]], stood and was elected for the latter constituency.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"left\"\n|

Initially, it was a [[parliamentary borough]], which returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to the [[House of Commons of England]] and later the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] until the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]], when its representation was reduced to one member.\n\nThe old borough was abolished with effect from the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]], but the name was transferred to a [[county constituency]], which elected a single member until the constituency was abolished with effect from the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], when the area it then covered was divided between the existing [[Cornwall North (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]] and the new [[Cornwall South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall South East]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1885\u20131918''': The Boroughs of Bodmin and Liskeard, the Sessional Division of East, South, and West Hundred, part of the Sessional Division of Powder Tywardreath, and the parishes of Bodmin, Helland, and Lanivet.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Boroughs of Bodmin, Fowey, Liskeard, Lostwithiel, and Saltash, the Urban Districts of Callington, Looe, and Torpoint, the Rural Districts of Liskeard and St Germans, in the Rural District of St Austell the parishes of St Sampson and Tywardreath, and part of the Rural District of Bodmin.\n\n'''1950\u20131974''': The Boroughs of Bodmin, Fowey, Liskeard, Lostwithiel, and Saltash, the Urban Districts of Looe and Torpoint, the Rural Districts of Liskeard and St Germans, in the Rural District of St Austell the parishes of Lanlivery, Luxulyan, and St Sampson, and in the Rural District of Wadebridge the parishes of Blisland, Cardinham, Helland, Lanhydrock, Lanivet, and Withiel.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The Boroughs of Bodmin, Liskeard, and Saltash, the Urban Districts of Looe and Torpoint, the Rural Districts of Liskeard and St Germans, the Rural Borough of Lostwithiel, in the Rural District of St Austell the parishes of Lanlivery, Luxulyan, and St Sampson, and in the Rural District of Wadebridge and Padstow the parishes of Blisland, Cardinham, Helland, Lanhydrock, Lanivet, and Withiel.\n\n==History==\n===Borough constituency (1295\u20131885)===\nThe borough which was represented from the time of the [[Model Parliament]] consisted of the town of [[Bodmin]] though not the whole of the parish. Unlike many of the [[Cornish rotten boroughs|boroughs in Cornwall]] which were represented in the [[Unreformed House of Commons]], Bodmin was a town of reasonable size and retained some importance; for most purposes, indeed, it was considered the county town of Cornwall. In 1831, the population of the borough was 3,375, and contained 596 houses.\n\nThe right to vote, however, was held not by the residents at large but by the town's corporation, consisting of a Mayor, 11 [[alderman|aldermen]] and 24 common councilmen. Contested elections were quite unknown before the Reform Act, the choice of the two MPs being left entirely to the \"patron\". However, this power did not arise, as in many [[rotten borough]]s, from the patron being able to coerce the voters; in Bodmin, the patron was expected to meet the public and private expenses of the corporation and its members in return for their acquiescence at election time.\n\nEarly in the 18th century, the Robartes family ([[Earl of Radnor|Earls of Radnor]]) were the accepted patrons. Their interest was inherited by [[George Hunt (MP)|George Hunt]], whose mother was the Robartes heiress, but he ran into difficulties and could not afford to retain complete control. By the 1760s another local magnate, [[William Irby, 1st Baron Boston|Sir William Irby]], secured enough of the town's goodwill to have a say in the choice of one member, while Hunt continued to select the other. In 1816, the patron was [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset|Lord de Dunstanville]], nominating both MPs, but he found himself so overburdened with debts that he was forced to give it up, and [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 2nd Marquess of Hertford|The Marquess of Hertford]] was induced to take over the patronage, and the corporation's debts.\n\nWhile the MP was not expected to assume the same financial obligations as the patron, nor to attend to the needs of his constituents in the manner of a modern MP, they were expected to attend the election ball, a high point in the social calendar for the wives and daughters of the otherwise undistinguished corporation members. [[John Wilson Croker]], elected in 1820, described the Bodmin ball as \"tumultuous and merry \" but \"at once tiresome and foolish\".\n\nBodmin retained both its MPs under the Reform Act, but its boundaries were extended to bring in more of Bodmin parish and the whole of the neighbouring parishes of [[Lanivet]], [[Lanhydrock]] and [[Helland]]. This increased the population to 5,258, although only 252 were qualified to vote.\n\nBy the time of the second Reform Act in 1867, Bodmin's electorate was still below 400, and consequently its representation was halved with effect from the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]]. The extension of the franchise more than doubled the electorate, but Bodmin was still far too small to survive as a borough, and was abolished in 1885.\n\n===County constituency (1885\u20131983)===\n[[File:Bodmin 1918-45.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Bodmin in Cornwall & Devon 1918\u20131945]]\nThe Bodmin constituency from 1885 until 1918, strictly called the '''South-Eastern or Bodmin Division of Cornwall''', covered the whole of the south-east corner of the county, including as well as Bodmin itself the towns of [[Liskeard]], [[Fowey]], [[Lostwithiel]] and [[Saltash]]. Although predominantly rural, the string of small ports along its coast gave it a maritime as well as agricultural character. Through most of this period the constituency was marginal, the Unionists being helped by the popularity of their candidate [[Leonard Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith|Leonard Courtney]], who had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP for [[Liskeard (UK Parliament constituency)|Liskeard]] when it was still a separate borough before joining the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] when the party split in 1886. [[Looe]] and the other fishing ports were predominantly Liberal and Fowey a Unionist stronghold, while the areas within the ambit of [[Plymouth]]'s dockyards tended to vote against whichever was the sitting government. Another factor was the strength of non-conformist religion, as elsewhere in Cornwall, and this was thought to be the explanation for the Liberal gain in 1906, when agricultural seats elsewhere mostly remained with the Tories.\n\nThe boundary changes at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], which established what was now called '''Cornwall, Bodmin Division''', and later '''Bodmin County Constituency''', extended the constituency somewhat towards the centre of the county, taking in [[Callington, Cornwall|Callington]] and the surrounding district. These boundaries remained essentially unchanged for the remainder of the constituency's existence, except that Fowey was moved into the [[Truro (UK Parliament constituency)|Truro]] constituency in 1974. As elsewhere in Cornwall, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] never established a foothold in Bodmin, and the Liberals remained the main challengers to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. The Conservatives held it continuously from 1945 to 1964, and at one point might have considered it a safe seat, but by the mid-1960s the Liberal revival had established it as a Liberal-Conservative marginal, which it remained until its abolition.\n\nThe Bodmin constituency ceased to exist as a result of the boundary changes implemented in 1983. Although the bulk of the constituency survived, Bodmin itself had been moved, enforcing a change of name: Bodmin joined [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]], while the rest of the constituency was reunited with Fowey to become [[South East Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cornwall]]. Bodmin's last Member, [[Robert Hicks (British politician)|Robert Hicks]], stood and was elected for the latter constituency.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"left\"\n|

His [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] dogma, with distinct echoes from [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish ethics]], was first shaped during [[World War I]], when Relgis was a [[conscientious objector]]. Infused with [[anarcho-pacifism]] and [[socialism]], it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as [[Romain Rolland]], [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for [[eugenics]], which centered on the [[compulsory sterilization]] of \"[[Degeneration|degenerates]]\". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and [[Sociology|sociological]] tracts.\n\nAfter an early debut with [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's Symbolist movement]], Relgis promoted [[modernist literature]] and the poetry of [[Tudor Arghezi]], signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of [[Expressionism]] and [[Didacticism|didactic art]], giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a [[hearing impairment]]. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as ''[[Sbur\u0103torul]]'', ''[[Contimporanul]]'' or ''[[\u0218antier]]'', but also close to the more mainstream journal ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]''. His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both [[fascism]] and [[communism]]: persecuted during [[World War II]], he eventually took refuge in [[Uruguay]]. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of [[South America]]n circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to [[world peace]], as well as a promoter of [[Latin American culture]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and literary debut===\nThe future Eugen Relgis was a native of [[Moldavia]] region, belonging to the [[History of the Jews in Romania|local Jewish community]].

The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of \"state [[fetishism]]\", seeking to overturn it and create \"universal fraternity\",<ref name=\"gc937\">C\u0103linescu, p.937</ref> and, in ''Diario de oto\u00f1o'', postulated a necessary distinction between Law (\"which may be interpreted for or against\") and Justice (\"elementary\" and unavoidable).<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled \"the three idols: State, Property, Money.\"<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> Political philosopher [[\u00c1ngel Cappelletti]] argues: \"Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to [[Left-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideas\".<ref name=\"aclxxvii\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Stefan Zweig]], Relgis fought \"tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity.\"<ref name=\"wr12\"/> The sentiment was echoed by [[Romain Rolland]], who recognized in Relgis his disciple: \"There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and [[Universalism|universalist]] idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being.\"<ref name=\"ddgsI\">Dorian & \u0218erban, p.I</ref> Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian [[George C\u0103linescu]] observed Relgis' [[anti-establishment]] and [[anti-art]]istic rhetoric, but described it as mere \"[[Idealism|idealist]] reverie\", \"without any daring proposals that would threaten our [[self-preservation]] instincts\".<ref name=\"gc937\"/> Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as \"an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems\", \"a practical and not a [[utopian]] thinker\", and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved.<ref name=\"wr12\"/>\n\nRelgis' [[humanitarianism]] (also known as [[humanism]] or pan-humanism; {{lang-es|humanitarismo}})<ref>Rose, p.12. See also Dorian & \u0218erban, p.VII</ref> was a practical extension of [[anarcho-pacifism]]. William Rose describes this doctrine as both \"universalist and pacifist\", noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things \"which separate man from man and cause wars\".<ref name=\"wr12\"/> Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of \"active thought\", and \"a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities\",<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> while expressing admiration for the [[nonviolent resistance]] tactics advocated in [[British Raj|British India]] by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] or [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/><ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> At the time, he attacked all forms of [[pan-nationalism]], from [[Pan-Germanism]] to [[Pan-European nationalism]], defining pan-humanism as \"the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species\".<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> In ''El humanitarismo'', he called all [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] movements, except his own, corrupted by \"the practice of violence and intolerance\".<ref name=\"acpensador\"/>\n\nWriting in 1933, the leftist literary columnist [[Ion Clopo\u021bel]] stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with \"a lively, dynamic and innovating [[socialism]]\".<ref name=\"ic(33)169\">Clopo\u021bel (1933), p.169</ref> Although left-wing, Relgis' vision also incorporated militant [[anti-communism]]. As noted by literary historian [[Geo \u0218erban]], he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of \"[[social revolution]]s\" and [[Bolshevik]] insurgency.<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> In the first issue of ''Umanitarianismul'', Relgis criticized both the [[far right]] and the [[far left]], noting that his ideology was \"apolitical, in fact antipolitical\".<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> In ''Europa cea t\u00e2n\u0103r\u0103'', he referred to the [[Soviet Union]] as the home of \"[[proletarian]] [[imperialism]]\".<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> These thoughts were detailed by ''Diario de oto\u00f1o'', which drew a direct comparison between the [[Red Army]], pushing Romania into an \"armed peace\", and the [[Wehrmacht]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/>\n\n===Judaism, Zionism, Jewish culture===\nBeginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of [[Zionism]], convinced that the path of [[Jewish assimilation]] was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> He also adhered to philosopher [[Martin Buber]]'s ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]]: universalism, Zionism and [[Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the [[Land of Israel]], and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the [[Palestinian people|Palestine Arabs]].<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, \"being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist.\"<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow \"the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism.\"<ref name=\"ddgsII, V\"/> The writer also described himself as committed to [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and, as late as 1981, noted that [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was still his language of choice.<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/>\n\nHis essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David)<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/><ref name=\"ddgsV\"/> speak about the threat of [[societal collapse]], which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after [[World War I]]. His theory on \"[[dehumanization]]\" postulated: \"the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms.\"<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose [[monotheism]] and [[Messianism]] he decoded the basic representation of [[moral responsibility]], and the immediate precursors of [[Christianity]].<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/><ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of [[Jewish ethics]] which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the [[Bible]] as \"that most humane book\", and identifying himself with the lament of [[Malachi]] 2:10 (\"Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?\").<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive \"the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith\", with creating \"new values from the old ones\".<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: \"Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe.\"<ref name=\"ddgsIV\"/><ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/><ref name=\"rjpietreni\"/>\n\nIn tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where [[bigotry]], and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/><ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> He reserved special criticism for the notions of a \"vengeful God\" and \"[[Jews as a chosen people|Jewish chosenness]]\", arguing that they are \"primitive\", and expressed more sympathy for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] universalism.<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> His texts, including the 1922 ''Apel c\u0103tre...'', are thought by some to be purposefully reusing the pro-universalist vocabulary of [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/>\n\nRelgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet [[Moses]], in whom he sees the symbol of \"great human aspirations\".<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from [[Baruch Spinoza]] to [[Charles Darwin]]), others talk about [[secular Jewish culture]], and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, [[Edmond Fleg]], [[Theodor Herzl]].<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the [[modern art]] of [[Marcel Janco]], [[Laz\u0103r Zin]] or [[Reuven Rubin]], and in the literature of Zweig, [[S. Ansky]], [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]] and even [[Marcel Proust]].<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from [[A. L. Zissu]] and [[Iosif Bruc\u01cer]] to [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]] and [[Enric Furtun\u0103]].<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> According to Geo \u0218erban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting \"a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world.\"<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/>\n\nA critic of [[antisemitism]], Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of [[anti-fascism]]. Early on, he exposed claims about [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic domination]] as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> He wrote: \"I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a [[phobia]], that is to say an [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world\u2014and all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession.\"<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/><ref name=\"ddgsV\"/>\n\nWriting in 1946, shortly after the scale of [[The Holocaust]] became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that [[Soap made from human corpses|Nazis fabricated human soap]].<ref>Oi\u0219teanu, p.69</ref> Historian of ideas [[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]] analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.<ref>Oi\u0219teanu, p.69-70</ref>\n\n===On Latin America===\nAfter his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on [[Latin America]] as a \"neohumanist\" continent.<ref>Riose, ''passim''</ref> Earlier, in ''Europa cea t\u00e2n\u0103r\u0103'', Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its \"pathetic history\" of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of [[Eastern philosophy]] and United States models of [[industrialization]].<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's \"spiritual renunciations\" were mirrored by a \"cancer of machinism\" in [[North America]].<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/>\n\nWith ''Perspectivas culturales en Sudam\u00e9rica'', he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a [[Latin American culture]] was still ahead.<ref>Rose, p.12-13</ref> Relgis identified this as a merit, describing [[South America]] in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a \"healthier\" example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the [[Cold War]] era.<ref name=\"wr13-14\">Rose, p.13-14</ref> Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: \"the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world.\"<ref name=\"wr13\"/> Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and \"[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] mentality\", while fighting the \"false moral\" of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism.<ref name=\"wr13-14\"/> Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3]].<ref>Rose, p.14</ref>\n\nRelgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was [[Argentina|Argentine]] poet and historian [[Arturo Capdevila]], who wrote about Relgis as a \"meritorious\" visionary with a \"grave and vital message\", assuring him: \"You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied.\"<ref name=\"wr12\"/> Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included [[Socialist Party of Uruguay|Socialist Party]] leader [[Emilio Frugoni]], [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] politician [[Am\u00edlcar Vasconcellos]], Zionist academic [[Joel Gak]] and poet [[Carlos Sabat Ercasty]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of [[Antigone]], Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with \"the constricting reality\".<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agust\u00edn Courtoisie calls Relgis \"eccentric and genial\", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' [[fantasy literature]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/>\n\n===Eugenics===\nLike other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of \"social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement.\"<ref name=\"pt162-163\"/> Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for [[eugenics]], advocating universal [[birth control]] and [[compulsory sterilization]] in cases of \"[[degeneration]]\".<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/><ref name=\"aerlgitana\"/><ref name=\"mt93-94\">Turda, p.93-94</ref> According to Agust\u00edn Courtoisie: \"Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]\".<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated [[Neo-Malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]], and especially with [[Manuel Devald\u00e8s]]. He praised Devald\u00e8s' call for [[vasectomy]] as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure \"a true revolution\" in population growth.<ref name=\"mt93-94\"/> His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and [[Pierre Ramus]].<ref>Masjuan, p.406-407</ref> According to Romanian [[biomedicine]] historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, \"forced [eugenic sterilization] into the realm of public debate\".<ref name=\"mt93\">Turda, p.93</ref>\n\nTurda also notes that ''Umanitarism \u0219i eugenism'' went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the [[involuntary euthanasia]] of \"degenerate\" individuals: those with \"pathological characteristics or incurable diseases.\"<ref name=\"mt93\"/> Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: \"It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived.\"<ref name=\"mt93\"/> His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually \"prolific\", but otherwise \"degenerate\", individuals.<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/> To this goal, he supported [[abortion]], both for eugenic and [[pro-choice]] reasons.<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/> Relgis also argued: \"Instead of [[natural selection]], man should practice rational selection.\"<ref>Bucur, p.187</ref> With ''Las aberraciones sexuales...'', Relgis condemned [[Nazi eugenics]] as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as \"[[Untermensch|sub-humans]]\" needed to be reeducated and (if \"incurable\") sterilized by non-Nazi physicians.<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/>\n\nIn this context, Relgis identified [[multiracial]] society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a [[Race of the Future|future American racial type]]. In this, Relgis saw the \"integral man\" of his humanitarianism, \"healthy and strong\", with a mind unbound by \"super-refined culture\", and without the traumatic experience of \"tyrannical ideologies\".<ref name=\"wr13\"/> The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but \"more universal\" than, the [[La Raza C\u00f3smica|Cosmic Race theory]] of Mexican academic [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]].<ref name=\"wr13\"/>\n\n==Literary contribution==\n\n===Literary style and principles===\nEugen Relgis blended a critique of [[capitalism]], advocacy of internationalism and [[modern art]] interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and \"all too cerebral\" novels, George C\u0103linescu argues, Eugen Relgis was \"obsessed with humanitarianism\" and [[self-help]] techniques.<ref name=\"gc937\"/> With his 1934 piece for ''[[\u0218antier]]'', Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, [[Individualism|individualist]] one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works (\"the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]], the temple, the cathedral\"), often demanding \"the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations.\"<ref name=\"vr2,1934\"/> Presently, he thought, the combat against the \"imperative of Profit\" and \"[[Economic materialism|vulgar materialism]]\" justified the \"ethical and [[Aesthetic relativism|aesthetic individualism]]\". Relgis' essay described [[industrial society]] in harsh terms, as directed by \"the bloody gods\" of \"Capitalism and War\", and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to [[kitsch]] (\"serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days\").<ref name=\"vr2,1934\"/> Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, \"needs to be the expression of length and depth.\"<ref name=\"ddgsIV\"/>\n\nSome of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at ''Fronda''. Its [[art manifesto]]s, described by [[Paul Cernat]] as \"virtually illegible\", announced radical ideals, such as [[art for art's sake]] through [[Great Fire of Rome|Neronian destruction]]: ''[[Qualis artifex pereo]]''.<ref name=\"pc56\"/> [[Leon Baconsky]], a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all ''Frondistes'' were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist [[Remy de Gourmont]], to whom Cernat adds philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] thinker [[Jean-Marie Guyau]] (both of them dedicated \"prolix-metaphoric commentary\" in the review's pages).<ref name=\"pc56\"/> In matters of [[poetics]], the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of [[Tudor Arghezi]] (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three ''Fronda'' issues) and, to a lesser extent, [[Ion Minulescu]]\u2014according to Baconsky, ''Fronda'' was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon.<ref name=\"pc56\"/>\n\nThe cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic [[Pompiliu P\u0103lt\u00e2nea]], believed that, with his contribution to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], Relgis was part of a diverse [[anti-war]] \"ideological\"  group of writers (alongside [[Felix Aderca]], [[Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u0219ti]], [[Barbu L\u0103z\u0103reanu]] and some others).<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [[Pompiliu P\u0103lt\u00e2nea]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2019162/f237.image.r \"Lettres roumaines\"], in ''[[Mercure de France]]'', Nr. 576, June 1922, p.803 (digitized by the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])</ref> According to C\u0103linescu, Relgis' literary ideal became \"the living book\", the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such \"idols\" as Rolland, Zweig, [[Henri Barbusse]], [[Heinrich Mann]] and [[Ludwig Rubiner]].<ref name=\"gc937\"/> An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European [[Expressionism]], in fashion at the start of Relgis' career.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/>\n\nIn addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to [[travel literature]], deemed \"his most characteristic works\" by William Rose.<ref name=\"wr12\"/> These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: [[Ion Clopo\u021bel]] noted that, in his volume about interwar [[Bulgaria]], Relgis went beyond the facade of \"savage\" Bulgarian [[militarism]] to depict the humanist, vegetarian and \"[[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyan]]\" civil society of that age.<ref>Clopo\u021bel (1933), p.168</ref> ''Bulgaria necunoscut\u0103'' also worked as a manifesto of [[anti-intellectualism]], chastising the \"[[Demagogy|demagogue]]\" academics and praising the simplicity of \"collective life\".<ref name=\"ic(33)169\"/> In a similar way, Relgis' scattered [[memoir]]s, among them ''Str\u0103mo\u0219ul meu, \"David Gugumanul\"'' (\"My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' \"), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism.<ref name=\"ddgsIII-IV\"/><ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/>\n\nOther such [[Didacticism|didactic]] texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. ''Glasuri \u00een surdin\u0103'' is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' [[alter ego]], Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life.<ref>Batson & Bergman, p.xi-xii, 206, 307\u2013308</ref> However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron \"is not really representative of the deaf majority\", leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness.<ref>Batson & Bergman, p.xii</ref> Relgis' patron [[Eugen Lovinescu]] was especially critical of the work, judging its \"self-analyzing\" [[internal monologue]] as burdensome.<ref>Lovinescu, p.238</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' ''Petru Arbore'' is noted by [[Geo \u0218erban]] as a \"rarity\" in Romanian literature, \"instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism.\"<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> Eugen Lovinescu notes its traditional theme of social \"inadaptation\", which, to him, echoes the [[right-wing]] didacticism of ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' writers.<ref name=\"Lovinescu, p.237\">Lovinescu, p.237</ref> Over the three volumes, the idealistic Arbore falls in love with women of various conditions, and, to the backdrop of World War I, tries to build a business as an army supplier.<ref name=\"Lovinescu, p.237\"/> Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his [[autobiography]], but as the \"spiritual mirror\" of each reader.<ref name=\"ddgsIV\"/> Lovinescu believed the work to be heavily influenced by Rolland's ''[[Jean-Christophe]]'', lacking \"inventiveness\".<ref>Lovinescu, p.237-238</ref>\n\nCalled a \"sweet volume of essays\" by Clopo\u021bel,<ref name=\"icmiron\"/> ''Prieteniile lui Miron'' chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, \"who mistakes love for sport\", being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship.<ref name=\"icmiron\"/> Clopo\u021bel praised the text for its \"seriousness\", \"finesse\" and \"reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility\", concluding: \"[This is] a literature of moral health.\"<ref name=\"icmiron\"/>\n\nThese characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to [[Latin American literature]]. Courtoisie found ''Diario de oto\u00f1o'', a book that is \"miscellaneous, multithematic, [moving] between the poetic and the everyday\", comparable to the ''Fermentario'' essays of Uruguay's [[Carlos Vaz Ferreira]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> According to critic William T. Starr, ''El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria'' and other such recollections reveal \"more about Relgis than about Rolland\".<ref>William T. Starr, \"Romain Rolland\", in Douglas W. Alden, Richard A. Brooks (eds.), ''A Critical Bibliography of French Literature: The Twentieth Century'', [[Syracuse University Press]], New York City, 1979, p.451-452, 463.  {{ISBN|0-8156-2204-X}}</ref>\n\n===Poetry===\nDuring his time at ''Fronda'', Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published [[Collective poetry|collective]], [[Experimental literature|experimental]] and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Cernat, \"aesthetically monstrous\".<ref name=\"pc56\"/> This perspective is echoed by \u0218erban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without \"convincing results\".<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> In ''Triumful nefiin\u021bei'', the main stylistic reference was, according to Lovinescu, the Romanian Symbolist [[Prose poetry|prose poet]] [[Dimitrie Anghel]], imitated to the point of \"[[pastiche]]\".<ref>Lovinescu, p.100, 237</ref>\n\nWith time, Relgis developed a style deemed \"the poetry of professions\" by George C\u0103linescu. According to C\u0103linescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists [[Alexandru Tudor-Miu]] and [[Barbu Solacolu]], but also to [[Simona Basarab]], [[Leon Feraru]], [[Cristian S\u00e2rbu]] and [[Stelian Constantin-Stelian]].<ref name=\"gc937\"/> The same critic notes that Relgis \"attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters.\"<ref name=\"gc936\">C\u0103linescu, p.936</ref> Lovinescu describes the poet in Relgis as one who \"survived\" through humanitarian propaganda, returning \"in a compact [[\u00c9mile Verhaeren|Verhaeren]] form, rhetorical and accumulative.\"<ref>Lovinescu, p.100</ref> Lovinescu includes the resulting works in a category of \"descriptive\" and \"social\" poems, relating Relgis to Feraru, [[Alice C\u0103lug\u0103ru]], [[Aron Cotru\u0219]], [[Vasile Demetrius]], [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[I. Valerian]].<ref>Lovinescu, p.98-104</ref>\n\nRelgis' poems, C\u0103linescu notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery (\"The Elevator\", \"The Cement Mixer\") or workers (\"The Builder\", \"The Day Laborer\"), as temples and deities; by \"natural association\", the critic suggests, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals (\"The Giraffe\", \"The Elephant\"), but \"this requires greater means of suggestion\".<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.936-937</ref> In one piece quoted by George C\u0103linescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a [[scaffolding]] structure:\n{{Verse translation|\nDe sus, pe schelele u\u0219oare\nOra\u0219ul \u00eel cuprind \u00eentreg,\nMasiv \u0219i d\u00e2rz: \u2014enorm\u0103 st\u00e2nc\u0103\nCe-a fost ascuns\u0103-n noapte-ad\u00e2nc\u0103,\n\u0218i care s-a ivit sub soare\nPrin str\u0103duin\u021bi a mii de ani\u2014\nUrc\u00e2nd \u00eencet, ne\u00eenfr\u00e2nat,\nPrin for\u021ba micilor titani.<ref name=\"gc936\"/>\n|\nUp there, on flimsy scaffolds,\nI stare all across this city,\nMassive and daring: \u2014enormous rock\nThat was hidden into deepest night\nAnd reemerged under the sun,\nMillennial efforts behind it\u2014\nClimbing slowly, ceaselessly,\nFed by the force of tiny titans.}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by \"four dictatorial regimes in his native country\".<ref name=\"wr12\"/> Before this, \u0218erban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of \"opinion maker\".<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as \"almost forgotten\" by Romanians after his self-exile.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included [[F\u0103lticeni]] journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html ''F\u0103lticenii prin timp \u0219i peste timp''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613161106/http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html |date=2011-06-13 }}, at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site] ; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref> According to journalist Victor Frunz\u0103, Relgis' targeting by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general.<ref name=\"ascumsedistruge\"/>\n\nAttempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community.

His [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] dogma, with distinct echoes from [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish ethics]], was first shaped during [[World War I]], when Relgis was a [[conscientious objector]]. Infused with [[anarcho-pacifism]] and [[socialism]], it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as [[Romain Rolland]], [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for [[eugenics]], which centered on the [[compulsory sterilization]] of \"[[Degeneration|degenerates]]\". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and [[Sociology|sociological]] tracts.\n\nAfter an early debut with [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's Symbolist movement]], Relgis promoted [[modernist literature]] and the poetry of [[Tudor Arghezi]], signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of [[Expressionism]] and [[Didacticism|didactic art]], giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a [[hearing impairment]]. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as ''[[Sbur\u0103torul]]'', ''[[Contimporanul]]'' or ''[[\u0218antier]]'', but also close to the more mainstream journal ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]''. His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both [[fascism]] and [[communism]]: persecuted during [[World War II]], he eventually took refuge in [[Uruguay]]. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of [[South America]]n circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to [[world peace]], as well as a promoter of [[Latin American culture]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and literary debut===\nThe future Eugen Relgis was a native of [[Moldavia]] region, belonging to the [[History of the Jews in Romania|local Jewish community]].

The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of \"state [[fetishism]]\", seeking to overturn it and create \"universal fraternity\",<ref name=\"gc937\">C\u0103linescu, p.937</ref> and, in ''Diario de oto\u00f1o'', postulated a necessary distinction between Law (\"which may be interpreted for or against\") and Justice (\"elementary\" and unavoidable).<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled \"the three idols: State, Property, Money.\"<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> Political philosopher [[\u00c1ngel Cappelletti]] argues: \"Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to [[Left-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideas\".<ref name=\"aclxxvii\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Stefan Zweig]], Relgis fought \"tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity.\"<ref name=\"wr12\"/> The sentiment was echoed by [[Romain Rolland]], who recognized in Relgis his disciple: \"There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and [[Universalism|universalist]] idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being.\"<ref name=\"ddgsI\">Dorian & \u0218erban, p.I</ref> Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian [[George C\u0103linescu]] observed Relgis' [[anti-establishment]] and [[anti-art]]istic rhetoric, but described it as mere \"[[Idealism|idealist]] reverie\", \"without any daring proposals that would threaten our [[self-preservation]] instincts\".<ref name=\"gc937\"/> Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as \"an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems\", \"a practical and not a [[utopian]] thinker\", and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved.<ref name=\"wr12\"/>\n\nRelgis' [[humanitarianism]] (also known as [[humanism]] or pan-humanism; {{lang-es|humanitarismo}})<ref>Rose, p.12. See also Dorian & \u0218erban, p.VII</ref> was a practical extension of [[anarcho-pacifism]]. William Rose describes this doctrine as both \"universalist and pacifist\", noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things \"which separate man from man and cause wars\".<ref name=\"wr12\"/> Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of \"active thought\", and \"a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities\",<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> while expressing admiration for the [[nonviolent resistance]] tactics advocated in [[British Raj|British India]] by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] or [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/><ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> At the time, he attacked all forms of [[pan-nationalism]], from [[Pan-Germanism]] to [[Pan-European nationalism]], defining pan-humanism as \"the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species\".<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> In ''El humanitarismo'', he called all [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] movements, except his own, corrupted by \"the practice of violence and intolerance\".<ref name=\"acpensador\"/>\n\nWriting in 1933, the leftist literary columnist [[Ion Clopo\u021bel]] stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with \"a lively, dynamic and innovating [[socialism]]\".<ref name=\"ic(33)169\">Clopo\u021bel (1933), p.169</ref> Although left-wing, Relgis' vision also incorporated militant [[anti-communism]]. As noted by literary historian [[Geo \u0218erban]], he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of \"[[social revolution]]s\" and [[Bolshevik]] insurgency.<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> In the first issue of ''Umanitarianismul'', Relgis criticized both the [[far right]] and the [[far left]], noting that his ideology was \"apolitical, in fact antipolitical\".<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> In ''Europa cea t\u00e2n\u0103r\u0103'', he referred to the [[Soviet Union]] as the home of \"[[proletarian]] [[imperialism]]\".<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> These thoughts were detailed by ''Diario de oto\u00f1o'', which drew a direct comparison between the [[Red Army]], pushing Romania into an \"armed peace\", and the [[Wehrmacht]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/>\n\n===Judaism, Zionism, Jewish culture===\nBeginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of [[Zionism]], convinced that the path of [[Jewish assimilation]] was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> He also adhered to philosopher [[Martin Buber]]'s ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]]: universalism, Zionism and [[Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the [[Land of Israel]], and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the [[Palestinian people|Palestine Arabs]].<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, \"being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist.\"<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow \"the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism.\"<ref name=\"ddgsII, V\"/> The writer also described himself as committed to [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and, as late as 1981, noted that [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was still his language of choice.<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/>\n\nHis essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David)<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/><ref name=\"ddgsV\"/> speak about the threat of [[societal collapse]], which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after [[World War I]]. His theory on \"[[dehumanization]]\" postulated: \"the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms.\"<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose [[monotheism]] and [[Messianism]] he decoded the basic representation of [[moral responsibility]], and the immediate precursors of [[Christianity]].<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/><ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of [[Jewish ethics]] which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the [[Bible]] as \"that most humane book\", and identifying himself with the lament of [[Malachi]] 2:10 (\"Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?\").<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive \"the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith\", with creating \"new values from the old ones\".<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: \"Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe.\"<ref name=\"ddgsIV\"/><ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/><ref name=\"rjpietreni\"/>\n\nIn tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where [[bigotry]], and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/><ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> He reserved special criticism for the notions of a \"vengeful God\" and \"[[Jews as a chosen people|Jewish chosenness]]\", arguing that they are \"primitive\", and expressed more sympathy for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] universalism.<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> His texts, including the 1922 ''Apel c\u0103tre...'', are thought by some to be purposefully reusing the pro-universalist vocabulary of [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/>\n\nRelgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet [[Moses]], in whom he sees the symbol of \"great human aspirations\".<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from [[Baruch Spinoza]] to [[Charles Darwin]]), others talk about [[secular Jewish culture]], and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, [[Edmond Fleg]], [[Theodor Herzl]].<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the [[modern art]] of [[Marcel Janco]], [[Laz\u0103r Zin]] or [[Reuven Rubin]], and in the literature of Zweig, [[S. Ansky]], [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]] and even [[Marcel Proust]].<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from [[A. L. Zissu]] and [[Iosif Bruc\u01cer]] to [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]] and [[Enric Furtun\u0103]].<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/> According to Geo \u0218erban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting \"a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world.\"<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/>\n\nA critic of [[antisemitism]], Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of [[anti-fascism]]. Early on, he exposed claims about [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic domination]] as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> He wrote: \"I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a [[phobia]], that is to say an [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world\u2014and all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession.\"<ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/><ref name=\"ddgsV\"/>\n\nWriting in 1946, shortly after the scale of [[The Holocaust]] became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that [[Soap made from human corpses|Nazis fabricated human soap]].<ref>Oi\u0219teanu, p.69</ref> Historian of ideas [[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]] analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.<ref>Oi\u0219teanu, p.69-70</ref>\n\n===On Latin America===\nAfter his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on [[Latin America]] as a \"neohumanist\" continent.<ref>Riose, ''passim''</ref> Earlier, in ''Europa cea t\u00e2n\u0103r\u0103'', Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its \"pathetic history\" of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of [[Eastern philosophy]] and United States models of [[industrialization]].<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/> Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's \"spiritual renunciations\" were mirrored by a \"cancer of machinism\" in [[North America]].<ref name=\"ddgsVII\"/>\n\nWith ''Perspectivas culturales en Sudam\u00e9rica'', he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a [[Latin American culture]] was still ahead.<ref>Rose, p.12-13</ref> Relgis identified this as a merit, describing [[South America]] in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a \"healthier\" example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the [[Cold War]] era.<ref name=\"wr13-14\">Rose, p.13-14</ref> Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: \"the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world.\"<ref name=\"wr13\"/> Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and \"[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] mentality\", while fighting the \"false moral\" of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism.<ref name=\"wr13-14\"/> Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3]].<ref>Rose, p.14</ref>\n\nRelgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was [[Argentina|Argentine]] poet and historian [[Arturo Capdevila]], who wrote about Relgis as a \"meritorious\" visionary with a \"grave and vital message\", assuring him: \"You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied.\"<ref name=\"wr12\"/> Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included [[Socialist Party of Uruguay|Socialist Party]] leader [[Emilio Frugoni]], [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] politician [[Am\u00edlcar Vasconcellos]], Zionist academic [[Joel Gak]] and poet [[Carlos Sabat Ercasty]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of [[Antigone]], Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with \"the constricting reality\".<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agust\u00edn Courtoisie calls Relgis \"eccentric and genial\", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' [[fantasy literature]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/>\n\n===Eugenics===\nLike other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of \"social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement.\"<ref name=\"pt162-163\"/> Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for [[eugenics]], advocating universal [[birth control]] and [[compulsory sterilization]] in cases of \"[[degeneration]]\".<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/><ref name=\"aerlgitana\"/><ref name=\"mt93-94\">Turda, p.93-94</ref> According to Agust\u00edn Courtoisie: \"Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]\".<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated [[Neo-Malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]], and especially with [[Manuel Devald\u00e8s]]. He praised Devald\u00e8s' call for [[vasectomy]] as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure \"a true revolution\" in population growth.<ref name=\"mt93-94\"/> His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and [[Pierre Ramus]].<ref>Masjuan, p.406-407</ref> According to Romanian [[biomedicine]] historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, \"forced [eugenic sterilization] into the realm of public debate\".<ref name=\"mt93\">Turda, p.93</ref>\n\nTurda also notes that ''Umanitarism \u0219i eugenism'' went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the [[involuntary euthanasia]] of \"degenerate\" individuals: those with \"pathological characteristics or incurable diseases.\"<ref name=\"mt93\"/> Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: \"It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived.\"<ref name=\"mt93\"/> His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually \"prolific\", but otherwise \"degenerate\", individuals.<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/> To this goal, he supported [[abortion]], both for eugenic and [[pro-choice]] reasons.<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/> Relgis also argued: \"Instead of [[natural selection]], man should practice rational selection.\"<ref>Bucur, p.187</ref> With ''Las aberraciones sexuales...'', Relgis condemned [[Nazi eugenics]] as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as \"[[Untermensch|sub-humans]]\" needed to be reeducated and (if \"incurable\") sterilized by non-Nazi physicians.<ref name=\"filosofiaer\"/>\n\nIn this context, Relgis identified [[multiracial]] society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a [[Race of the Future|future American racial type]]. In this, Relgis saw the \"integral man\" of his humanitarianism, \"healthy and strong\", with a mind unbound by \"super-refined culture\", and without the traumatic experience of \"tyrannical ideologies\".<ref name=\"wr13\"/> The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but \"more universal\" than, the [[La Raza C\u00f3smica|Cosmic Race theory]] of Mexican academic [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]].<ref name=\"wr13\"/>\n\n==Literary contribution==\n\n===Literary style and principles===\nEugen Relgis blended a critique of [[capitalism]], advocacy of internationalism and [[modern art]] interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and \"all too cerebral\" novels, George C\u0103linescu argues, Eugen Relgis was \"obsessed with humanitarianism\" and [[self-help]] techniques.<ref name=\"gc937\"/> With his 1934 piece for ''[[\u0218antier]]'', Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, [[Individualism|individualist]] one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works (\"the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]], the temple, the cathedral\"), often demanding \"the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations.\"<ref name=\"vr2,1934\"/> Presently, he thought, the combat against the \"imperative of Profit\" and \"[[Economic materialism|vulgar materialism]]\" justified the \"ethical and [[Aesthetic relativism|aesthetic individualism]]\". Relgis' essay described [[industrial society]] in harsh terms, as directed by \"the bloody gods\" of \"Capitalism and War\", and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to [[kitsch]] (\"serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days\").<ref name=\"vr2,1934\"/> Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, \"needs to be the expression of length and depth.\"<ref name=\"ddgsIV\"/>\n\nSome of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at ''Fronda''. Its [[art manifesto]]s, described by [[Paul Cernat]] as \"virtually illegible\", announced radical ideals, such as [[art for art's sake]] through [[Great Fire of Rome|Neronian destruction]]: ''[[Qualis artifex pereo]]''.<ref name=\"pc56\"/> [[Leon Baconsky]], a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all ''Frondistes'' were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist [[Remy de Gourmont]], to whom Cernat adds philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] thinker [[Jean-Marie Guyau]] (both of them dedicated \"prolix-metaphoric commentary\" in the review's pages).<ref name=\"pc56\"/> In matters of [[poetics]], the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of [[Tudor Arghezi]] (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three ''Fronda'' issues) and, to a lesser extent, [[Ion Minulescu]]\u2014according to Baconsky, ''Fronda'' was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon.<ref name=\"pc56\"/>\n\nThe cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic [[Pompiliu P\u0103lt\u00e2nea]], believed that, with his contribution to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], Relgis was part of a diverse [[anti-war]] \"ideological\"  group of writers (alongside [[Felix Aderca]], [[Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u0219ti]], [[Barbu L\u0103z\u0103reanu]] and some others).<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [[Pompiliu P\u0103lt\u00e2nea]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2019162/f237.image.r \"Lettres roumaines\"], in ''[[Mercure de France]]'', Nr. 576, June 1922, p.803 (digitized by the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])</ref> According to C\u0103linescu, Relgis' literary ideal became \"the living book\", the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such \"idols\" as Rolland, Zweig, [[Henri Barbusse]], [[Heinrich Mann]] and [[Ludwig Rubiner]].<ref name=\"gc937\"/> An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European [[Expressionism]], in fashion at the start of Relgis' career.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/>\n\nIn addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to [[travel literature]], deemed \"his most characteristic works\" by William Rose.<ref name=\"wr12\"/> These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: [[Ion Clopo\u021bel]] noted that, in his volume about interwar [[Bulgaria]], Relgis went beyond the facade of \"savage\" Bulgarian [[militarism]] to depict the humanist, vegetarian and \"[[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyan]]\" civil society of that age.<ref>Clopo\u021bel (1933), p.168</ref> ''Bulgaria necunoscut\u0103'' also worked as a manifesto of [[anti-intellectualism]], chastising the \"[[Demagogy|demagogue]]\" academics and praising the simplicity of \"collective life\".<ref name=\"ic(33)169\"/> In a similar way, Relgis' scattered [[memoir]]s, among them ''Str\u0103mo\u0219ul meu, \"David Gugumanul\"'' (\"My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' \"), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism.<ref name=\"ddgsIII-IV\"/><ref name=\"gslvprolog\"/>\n\nOther such [[Didacticism|didactic]] texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. ''Glasuri \u00een surdin\u0103'' is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' [[alter ego]], Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life.<ref>Batson & Bergman, p.xi-xii, 206, 307\u2013308</ref> However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron \"is not really representative of the deaf majority\", leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness.<ref>Batson & Bergman, p.xii</ref> Relgis' patron [[Eugen Lovinescu]] was especially critical of the work, judging its \"self-analyzing\" [[internal monologue]] as burdensome.<ref>Lovinescu, p.238</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' ''Petru Arbore'' is noted by [[Geo \u0218erban]] as a \"rarity\" in Romanian literature, \"instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism.\"<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> Eugen Lovinescu notes its traditional theme of social \"inadaptation\", which, to him, echoes the [[right-wing]] didacticism of ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' writers.<ref name=\"Lovinescu, p.237\">Lovinescu, p.237</ref> Over the three volumes, the idealistic Arbore falls in love with women of various conditions, and, to the backdrop of World War I, tries to build a business as an army supplier.<ref name=\"Lovinescu, p.237\"/> Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his [[autobiography]], but as the \"spiritual mirror\" of each reader.<ref name=\"ddgsIV\"/> Lovinescu believed the work to be heavily influenced by Rolland's ''[[Jean-Christophe]]'', lacking \"inventiveness\".<ref>Lovinescu, p.237-238</ref>\n\nCalled a \"sweet volume of essays\" by Clopo\u021bel,<ref name=\"icmiron\"/> ''Prieteniile lui Miron'' chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, \"who mistakes love for sport\", being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship.<ref name=\"icmiron\"/> Clopo\u021bel praised the text for its \"seriousness\", \"finesse\" and \"reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility\", concluding: \"[This is] a literature of moral health.\"<ref name=\"icmiron\"/>\n\nThese characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to [[Latin American literature]]. Courtoisie found ''Diario de oto\u00f1o'', a book that is \"miscellaneous, multithematic, [moving] between the poetic and the everyday\", comparable to the ''Fermentario'' essays of Uruguay's [[Carlos Vaz Ferreira]].<ref name=\"acpensador\"/> According to critic William T. Starr, ''El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria'' and other such recollections reveal \"more about Relgis than about Rolland\".<ref>William T. Starr, \"Romain Rolland\", in Douglas W. Alden, Richard A. Brooks (eds.), ''A Critical Bibliography of French Literature: The Twentieth Century'', [[Syracuse University Press]], New York City, 1979, p.451-452, 463.  {{ISBN|0-8156-2204-X}}</ref>\n\n===Poetry===\nDuring his time at ''Fronda'', Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published [[Collective poetry|collective]], [[Experimental literature|experimental]] and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Cernat, \"aesthetically monstrous\".<ref name=\"pc56\"/> This perspective is echoed by \u0218erban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without \"convincing results\".<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> In ''Triumful nefiin\u021bei'', the main stylistic reference was, according to Lovinescu, the Romanian Symbolist [[Prose poetry|prose poet]] [[Dimitrie Anghel]], imitated to the point of \"[[pastiche]]\".<ref>Lovinescu, p.100, 237</ref>\n\nWith time, Relgis developed a style deemed \"the poetry of professions\" by George C\u0103linescu. According to C\u0103linescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists [[Alexandru Tudor-Miu]] and [[Barbu Solacolu]], but also to [[Simona Basarab]], [[Leon Feraru]], [[Cristian S\u00e2rbu]] and [[Stelian Constantin-Stelian]].<ref name=\"gc937\"/> The same critic notes that Relgis \"attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters.\"<ref name=\"gc936\">C\u0103linescu, p.936</ref> Lovinescu describes the poet in Relgis as one who \"survived\" through humanitarian propaganda, returning \"in a compact [[\u00c9mile Verhaeren|Verhaeren]] form, rhetorical and accumulative.\"<ref>Lovinescu, p.100</ref> Lovinescu includes the resulting works in a category of \"descriptive\" and \"social\" poems, relating Relgis to Feraru, [[Alice C\u0103lug\u0103ru]], [[Aron Cotru\u0219]], [[Vasile Demetrius]], [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[I. Valerian]].<ref>Lovinescu, p.98-104</ref>\n\nRelgis' poems, C\u0103linescu notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery (\"The Elevator\", \"The Cement Mixer\") or workers (\"The Builder\", \"The Day Laborer\"), as temples and deities; by \"natural association\", the critic suggests, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals (\"The Giraffe\", \"The Elephant\"), but \"this requires greater means of suggestion\".<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.936-937</ref> In one piece quoted by George C\u0103linescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a [[scaffolding]] structure:\n{{Verse translation|\nDe sus, pe schelele u\u0219oare\nOra\u0219ul \u00eel cuprind \u00eentreg,\nMasiv \u0219i d\u00e2rz: \u2014enorm\u0103 st\u00e2nc\u0103\nCe-a fost ascuns\u0103-n noapte-ad\u00e2nc\u0103,\n\u0218i care s-a ivit sub soare\nPrin str\u0103duin\u021bi a mii de ani\u2014\nUrc\u00e2nd \u00eencet, ne\u00eenfr\u00e2nat,\nPrin for\u021ba micilor titani.<ref name=\"gc936\"/>\n|\nUp there, on flimsy scaffolds,\nI stare all across this city,\nMassive and daring: \u2014enormous rock\nThat was hidden into deepest night\nAnd reemerged under the sun,\nMillennial efforts behind it\u2014\nClimbing slowly, ceaselessly,\nFed by the force of tiny titans.}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by \"four dictatorial regimes in his native country\".<ref name=\"wr12\"/> Before this, \u0218erban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of \"opinion maker\".<ref name=\"ddgsII\"/> Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as \"almost forgotten\" by Romanians after his self-exile.<ref name=\"bmiudaistul\"/> In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included [[F\u0103lticeni]] journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html ''F\u0103lticenii prin timp \u0219i peste timp''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613161106/http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html |date=2011-06-13 }}, at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site] ; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref> According to journalist Victor Frunz\u0103, Relgis' targeting by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general.<ref name=\"ascumsedistruge\"/>\n\nAttempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community.

The ritual marks the passage from child to adult male, each subgroup having its customs and expectations.}}\n\nA '''rite of passage''' is a [[food chain]] or [[ritual]] of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of [[social status|status in society]]. In [[cultural anthropology]] the term is the Anglicisation of ''rite de passage'', a French term innovated by the [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]] in his work ''Les rites de passage'', \"The Rites of Passage\".<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|1909|loc=Lay Summary}}</ref> The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.\n\n== Original conception ==\nIn English, Van Gennep's first sentence of his first chapter begins:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=I. The Classification of Rites}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, \"as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors.\"<ref name=Journet>{{cite journal | first=Nicolas | last=Journet | title=Les rites de passage | journal=Sciences Humaines | date=1 January 2001 | number=112 | url=http://www.scienceshumaines.com/les-rites-de-passage_fr_1079.html | quote=chaque soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une sorte de maison divis\u00e9e en chambres et couloirs}}</ref> A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.\n\nVan Gennep further distinguishes between \"the secular\" and \"the sacred sphere.\" Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent \"the simplest level of development,\" he hypothesizes that \"[[social groups]] in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations.\" Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase.  Passage between these groups requires a [[ceremony]], or ritual hence rite of passage.\n\nThe rest of Van Gennep's book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=X. Conclusions}}</ref> \"It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ....\" He is able to find some universals, mainly two: \"the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred.\" (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.\n\n==Stages==\nRites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. \"I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, ''preliminal rites'', those executed during the transitional stage ''liminal (or threshold) rites'', and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world ''postliminal rites''.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 21</ref>\n\nIn the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. \"The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80.</ref> There is often a detachment or \"cutting away\" from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is \"cutting away\" the former self: the civilian.\n\nThe transition (liminal) phase is the period between states, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. \"The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' (\"threshold people\") are necessarily ambiguous.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 95</ref>\n\nIn the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80</ref> Having completed the rite and assumed their \"new\" identity, one re-enters society with one's new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus \"in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the 'sacred bond', the 'sacred cord', the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 166</ref>\n\n==Psychological effects==\n\nLaboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce [[cognitive dissonance]].<ref>Aronson & Mills 1959.</ref> It is theorized that such dissonance heightens [[Interpersonal attraction|group attraction]] among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used.<ref>Festinger 1961.</ref> [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.<ref>Kamau 2012.</ref> As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce [[conformity]] among new members.<ref>Keating ''et al.'' 2005.</ref> Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].<ref>Lodewijkx ''et al.'' 2005.</ref>\n\n==Cultural==\n[[File:Hamer bull jumping (6) (29167685366).jpg|thumb|The [[Hamar people|Hamar]] are known for their custom of \"bull jumping,\" which initiates a boy into manhood.]]\nInitiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership.<ref name=\"Shahadah\">{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/africanculture.html | title= African Culture Complex | accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world.  Initiation rites are \"a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body\".  These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship.<ref>[http://www.manuampim.com/AfricanInitiationRites.htm The Five Major African Initiation Rites] Prof. Manu Ampim</ref> In Zulu culture entering womanhood is celebrated by the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga]].\n\n==Types and examples==\nRites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as ''Man Up Global''.

The ritual marks the passage from child to adult male, each subgroup having its customs and expectations.}}\n\nA '''rite of passage''' is a [[ceremony]] or [[ritual]] of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of [[social status|status in society]]. In [[cultural anthropology]] the term is the Anglicisation of ''rite de passage'', a French term innovated by the [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]] in his work ''Les rites de passage'', \"The Rites of Passage\".<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|1909|loc=Lay Summary}}</ref> The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.\n\n== Original conception ==\nIn English, Van Gennep's first sentence of his first chapter begins:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=I. The Classification of Rites}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, \"as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors.\"<ref name=Journet>{{cite journal | first=Nicolas | last=Journet | title=Les rites de passage | journal=Sciences Humaines | date=1 January 2001 | number=112 | url=http://www.scienceshumaines.com/les-rites-de-passage_fr_1079.html | quote=chaque soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une sorte de maison divis\u00e9e en chambres et couloirs}}</ref> A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.\n\nVan Gennep further distinguishes between \"the secular\" and \"the sacred sphere.\" Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent \"the simplest level of development,\" he hypothesizes that \"[[social groups]] in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations.\" Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase.  Passage between these groups requires a [[ceremony]], or ritual hence rite of passage.\n\nThe rest of Van Gennep's book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=X. Conclusions}}</ref> \"It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ....\" He is able to find some universals, mainly two: \"the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred.\" (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.\n\n==Stages==\nRites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. \"I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, ''preliminal rites'', those executed during the transitional stage ''liminal (or threshold) rites'', and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world ''postliminal rites''.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 21</ref>\n\nIn the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. \"The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80.</ref> There is often a detachment or \"cutting away\" from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is \"cutting away\" the former self: the civilian.\n\nThe transition (liminal) phase is the period between states, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. \"The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' (\"threshold people\") are necessarily ambiguous.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 95</ref>\n\nIn the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80</ref> Having completed the rite and assumed their \"new\" identity, one re-enters society with one's new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus \"in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the 'sacred bond', the 'sacred cord', the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 166</ref>\n\n==Psychological effects==\n\nLaboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce [[cognitive dissonance]].<ref>Aronson & Mills 1959.</ref> It is theorized that such dissonance heightens [[Interpersonal attraction|group attraction]] among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used.<ref>Festinger 1961.</ref> [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.<ref>Kamau 2012.</ref> As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce [[conformity]] among new members.<ref>Keating ''et al.'' 2005.</ref> Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].<ref>Lodewijkx ''et al.'' 2005.</ref>\n\n==Cultural==\n[[File:Hamer bull jumping (6) (29167685366).jpg|thumb|The [[Hamar people|Hamar]] are known for their custom of \"bull jumping,\" which initiates a boy into manhood.]]\nInitiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership.<ref name=\"Shahadah\">{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/africanculture.html | title= African Culture Complex | accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world.  Initiation rites are \"a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body\".  These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship.<ref>[http://www.manuampim.com/AfricanInitiationRites.htm The Five Major African Initiation Rites] Prof. Manu Ampim</ref> In Zulu culture entering womanhood is celebrated by the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga]].\n\n==Types and examples==\nRites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as ''Man Up Global''. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. [[Adventure education]] programs, such as [[Outward Bound]], have often been described as potential rites of passage. Pamela Cushing researched the rites of passage impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite of passage impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase.<ref>Cushing 1998.</ref> Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the \"Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage\" as a modern and weaker version of the rites of passage typically used by outdoor adventure programs.\n\n===Coming of age===\n[[File:Michael's Bar Mitzvah 3.jpg|thumb|Jewish boy reading a [[Torah]] scroll at his [[Bar Mitzvah]], using a [[Yad]]]]\n[[File:Landdiving2.jpg|thumb|[[Land diving]] is a rite of passage for boys of the South Pacific island of [[Pentecost Island|Pentecost]]]]\n[[File:Statuette Karaj\u00e0 MHNT.ETH.2011.17.30.jpg |thumb| Statuette Karaj\u00e0 : young initiate]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n{{Main|Coming of age}}\nIn various [[tribe| tribal societies]], entry into an [[age grade]]\u2014generally gender-separated\u2014(unlike an [[age set]]) is marked by an [[initiation| initiation rite]], which may be the crowning of a long and complex preparation, sometimes in retreat.\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]\n* [[Breeching (boys)|Breeching]], when an infant is put into boy's clothing\n* [[Coming of Age (Unitarian Universalism)|Coming of Age in Unitarian Universalism]]\n* Completion of [[toilet training]]\n* [[D\u00e9butante|D\u00e9butante ball]]\n* [[Dokimasia]]\n* First [[menstruation]], i.e. [[menarche]]\n** [[Seclusion of girls at puberty]]\n** ''Sevapuneru'' or [[Gaye holud|Turmeric]] ceremony\n* [[Graduation]]\n* [[Okuyi]] in several [[West African]] nations\n* ''[[Quincea\u00f1era]]''\n* [[Retirement]]\n* ''[[Russefeiring]]'' in [[Norway]]\n* [[Scarification]] and various other physical endurances\n* [[Secular coming of age ceremony|Secular coming of age ceremonies]] for non-religious youngsters who want a rite of passage comparable to the religious rituals like confirmation\n* [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|Sweet Sixteen]]\n* [[Wedding]]\n* [[Walkabout]]\n}}\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:20050921circoncisionB.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Jesus underwent Jewish [[circumcision]], here depicted in a Catholic cathedral; a [[Feast of the Circumcision|liturgical feast]] commemorates this on New Year's Day]]\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''[[Amrit Sanchar]]'' in [[Sikhism]]\n* ''[[Annaprashana]]''\n* [[Baptism]] ([[Infant baptism|Christening]])\n* [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]]\n* [[Circumcision]]\n** [[Brit milah|Bris]] in [[Judaism]] \n** ''[[Khitan (circumcision)|Khitan]]'' in [[Islam]]<ref>Morgenstern 1966.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= Rites of Passage|work= Oxford Islamic Studies Online |year=2013| url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2020?_hi=0&_pos=15 |accessdate= 27 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= Traditional Muslim Male Circumcision: Performed by Arabs, Turkish, Malaysian and Others of this faith. |work= CIRCLIST |url= http://www.circlist.com/rites/moslem.html |year= 1992\u20132013|accessdate= 27 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hamid|first=Ismail|title=Islamic Rites of Passage|work=The Encyclopedia of Malaysia Volume 10: Religions and Beliefs|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/islamicrites.html|year=2005|accessdate=27 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630163708/http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/islamicrites.html|archivedate=30 June 2013}}</ref>\n** In [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]<ref name=riggs_2006>{{cite book |author=Thomas Riggs |title=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices: Religions and denominations |chapter=Christianity: Coptic Christianity |year=2006 |publisher=Thomson Gale |isbn=978-0-7876-6612-5 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTMOAQAAMAAJ}}</ref><ref name=Columbia_encyc_2011_circ>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Circumcision |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/circumcision.html }}</ref>\n* [[Confirmation]] in Western [[Christianity]]\n* Diving for the Cross, in some [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] churches\n* [[First Communion]], First [[Eucharist]] and First [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]\n* Siddur presentation ceremony in Judaism\n* Bible presentation ceremony in several branches of [[Protestantism]] \n* [[Hajj]] in [[Islam]]\n* [[Chudakarana]] or hair cutting in Hinduism\n* [[Rumspringa]]\n* ''[[Sanskara (rite of passage)|Sanskara]]'' a series of [[sacrament]]s in [[Hinduism]]\n* ''[[Shinbyu]]'' in [[Theravada Buddhism]]\n* [[Vision quest]] in some Native American cultures\n* [[Wiccaning]] in [[Wicca]]\n}}\n\n===Military===\n* [[Recruit training|Boot Camp]] and [[Officer Candidate School]] are rites of passage from civilian to military life.

Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. [[Friedreich's ataxia]] has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom.<ref>dystaxia. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary.

As the condition progresses, walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side.<ref name =\"Schmahmann\" /> Turning is also problematic and could result in falls.

For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, [[flexion]] at the [[shoulder]] would create a torque at the [[elbow]], while [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the elbow would create a torque at the [[wrist]]. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement [[velocity|velocities]] and [[acceleration]]s.\n* '''[[Vestibulocerebellar syndrome|Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum]]''' ([[flocculonodular lobe]]) impairs the balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid [[titubation]] (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|spinocerebellum]]'''  ([[vermis]] and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based \"drunken sailor\" [[gait]] (called truncal ataxia),<ref name=\"Blumenfeld\">{{cite book | vauthors = Blumenfeld H | title = Neuroanatomy through clinical cases | publisher = Sinauer | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2002 | pages = 670\u2013671 | isbn = 0-87893-060-4 }}</ref> characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps.

This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s.\n\nSensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady \"stomping\" gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.\n\n[[Physician]]s can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient's finger will tend to \"fall down\" and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the \"ataxic hand\").\n\n=== Vestibular ===\nThe term ''vestibular ataxia'' is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.\n\n== Causes ==\nThe three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation. Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging.\n\n=== Focal lesions ===\nAny type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumor]], [[multiple sclerosis]], inflammatory [such as [[sarcoidosis]]], and \u201cchronic lymphocytyc inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids syndrome\u201d [CLIPPERS<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maenhoudt W, Ramboer K, Maqueda V | title = A Rare Cause of Dizziness and Gait Ataxia: CLIPPERS Syndrome | journal = Journal of the Belgian Society of Radiology | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 30151443 | pmc = 6102946 | doi = 10.5334/jbr-btr.997 }}</ref>]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum; sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord...to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal...(and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]); or vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]).\n\n=== Exogenous substances (metabolic ataxia) ===\nExogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function.

Examples include '''optic ataxia''' (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects) and '''ataxic respiration''' (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the [[medulla oblongata]]). Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex, which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement.

Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. [[Friedreich's ataxia]] has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom.<ref>dystaxia. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary.

For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, [[flexion]] at the [[shoulder]] would create a torque at the [[elbow]], while [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the elbow would create a torque at the [[wrist]]. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement [[velocity|velocities]] and [[acceleration]]s.\n* '''[[Vestibulocerebellar syndrome|Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum]]''' ([[flocculonodular lobe]]) impairs the balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid [[titubation]] (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|spinocerebellum]]'''  ([[vermis]] and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based \"drunken sailor\" [[gait]] (called truncal ataxia),<ref name=\"Blumenfeld\">{{cite book | vauthors = Blumenfeld H | title = Neuroanatomy through clinical cases | publisher = Sinauer | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2002 | pages = 670\u2013671 | isbn = 0-87893-060-4 }}</ref> characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps.

This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s.\n\nSensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady \"stomping\" gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.\n\n[[Physician]]s can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient's finger will tend to \"fall down\" and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the \"ataxic hand\").\n\n=== Vestibular ===\nThe term ''vestibular ataxia'' is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.\n\n== Causes ==\nThe three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation.

Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An aerial view of Interstate 5 and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail line in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]], or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|Interstate 205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

Due to problems arising from different definitions of wealth, ways of measuring it, various economic models throughout history, as well as multiple other reasons\u2014this article discusses the wealthiest people in the following separate historical periods: [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Middle Ages]] and [[modern period]]. Accordingly\u2014because of the previously mentioned difficulties\u2014it is not possible to determine the single richest person in all of history.\n\nFor the [[modern period]], wealth can be measured more or less objectively via [[inflation adjustment]], e.g. comparing the [[Economy of the United States|nominal GDP of the United States]] of the respective periods, and then converting it into contemporary United States dollars. For the medieval and ancient history, comparison of wealth becomes more problematic, on one hand due to the inaccuracy or unreliability of records, on the other due to the difficulty of comparing a pre-industrial economy to a modern one, and especially in the presence of [[absolute monarchy]], where an entire kingdom or empire is considered the ruler's personal property.  The latter factor is also an issue in the early modern to modern period, e.g. various lists shows, such as [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] among ''The 10 Richest People of All Time'' for his \"complete control of a nation with 9.6% of global GDP\".<ref name=\"time.com\"/>\n\nExcluding [[monarch]]s and [[autocracy|autocrats]], the wealthiest private individuals in the [[history of capitalism]] are variously identified as [[Jakob Fugger]] (died 1525), of the early modern [[Fugger]] family of merchants and bankers,<ref name=Fugger>Daniel Eckert,[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article155974825/So-wurde-Fugger-zum-reichsten-Menschen-der-Geschichte.html So wurde Jakob Fugger zum reichsten Menschen der Historie] (\"This is how Jakob Fugger became the wealthiest person in history\"), ''[[Die Welt]]'', 6 June 2016 {{in lang|de}}. \"Auf heutige Verh\u00e4ltnisse hochgerechnet l\u00e4ge das Verm\u00f6gen des Bauernenkels bei unglaublichen 400 Milliarden Dollar (354 Milliarden Euro).

By designing the [[Model T Ford]] with mass production in mind and employing the assembly line method of rapid production, he was able to radically lower the base price of his automobiles and reach a wider market. As production increased, Ford further reduced prices and increased salaries to reduce worker turnover. This resulted in a rapid increase in output, with Ford production rising from roughly 18,000 cars in 1909 to over 1 million cars in 1920.

Due to problems arising from different definitions of wealth, ways of measuring it, various economic models throughout history, as well as multiple other reasons\u2014this article discusses the wealthiest people in the following separate historical periods: [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Middle Ages]] and [[modern period]]. Accordingly\u2014because of the previously mentioned difficulties\u2014it is not possible to determine the single richest person in all of history.\n\nFor the [[modern period]], wealth can be measured more or less objectively via [[inflation adjustment]], e.g. comparing the [[Economy of the United States|nominal GDP of the United States]] of the respective periods, and then converting it into contemporary United States dollars. For the medieval and ancient history, comparison of wealth becomes more problematic, on one hand due to the inaccuracy or unreliability of records, on the other due to the difficulty of comparing a pre-industrial economy to a modern one, and especially in the presence of [[absolute monarchy]], where an entire kingdom or empire is considered the ruler's personal property.  The latter factor is also an issue in the early modern to modern period, e.g. various lists shows, such as [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] among ''The 10 Richest People of All Time'' for his \"complete control of a nation with 9.6% of global GDP\".<ref name=\"time.com\"/>\n\nExcluding [[monarch]]s and [[autocracy|autocrats]], the wealthiest private individuals in the [[history of capitalism]] are variously identified as [[Jakob Fugger]] (died 1525), of the early modern [[Fugger]] family of merchants and bankers,<ref name=Fugger>Daniel Eckert,[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article155974825/So-wurde-Fugger-zum-reichsten-Menschen-der-Geschichte.html So wurde Jakob Fugger zum reichsten Menschen der Historie] (\"This is how Jakob Fugger became the wealthiest person in history\"), ''[[Die Welt]]'', 6 June 2016 {{in lang|de}}. \"Auf heutige Verh\u00e4ltnisse hochgerechnet l\u00e4ge das Verm\u00f6gen des Bauernenkels bei unglaublichen 400 Milliarden Dollar (354 Milliarden Euro).

As production increased, Ford further reduced prices and increased salaries to reduce worker turnover. This resulted in a rapid increase in output, with Ford production rising from roughly 18,000 cars in 1909 to over 1 million cars in 1920. Despite Ford stating that his focus was increasing Ford Motor Company's benefit to society and to its employees, even at one point [[Dodge v. Ford Motor Company|being sued by the Dodge brothers]] based on this premise, his company was massively profitable. His highest earnings were recorded at age 57 and he died at the age of 83 in 1947 at a net worth of US$188.1 billion (inflation-adjusted value in 2008 dollars)\n|-\n|6\n|[[John Jacob Astor]]\n|1763\u20131848\n(85 years)\n|120\u2013138<ref name=\"Hargreaves\">{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/gallery/luxury/2014/06/01/richest-americans-in-history/2.html|title=The richest Americans in history|first=Steve|last=Hargreaves|publisher=}}</ref>\n|American businessman, merchant, opium smuggler, fur trader, and investor.
