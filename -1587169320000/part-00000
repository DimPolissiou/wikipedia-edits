He argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior. MacDonald also notes a negative shift in tone from the first book to the third, and attributes it to having learned more, read more, and \"changed greatly\" in that time.

He examines evidence from Jewish history, culture, and genetics supporting his thesis, arguing that Judaism is based on a strong -- and possibly genetically based -- predisposition to [[ethnocentrism]] characteristic of Middle Eastern cultures generally but exacerbated as a result of selective effects resulting from Jewish cultural practices. He considers the use of the complex and extensive Jewish scriptures and the high prestige of [[Rabbinic]] learning as [[eugenics|eugenic]] mechanisms for promoting Jewish verbal intelligence and [[dexterity]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''Separation and Its Discontents'' (1998)===\n\nDeveloping his work in ''A People that Shall Dwell Alone'', MacDonald examines antisemitism as a test case for an evolutionary analysis of ethnic conflict in general, applying social identity theory to three critical periods of institutionalized antisemitism: the Roman Empire in the fourth century; the [[Spanish Inquisition|Iberian inquisitions from the fourteenth century]]; and [[Nazi Germany|German Nazism]] in the period 1933-45. He argues that antisemitism can be analysed as a consequence of resource competition between groups in which each group is rationally pursuing its own interests, rather than as a manifestation of irrational malice by non-Jewish out-groups, and asserts that Jews, particularly strongly identified Jews, will be relatively prone to self-deception by ignoring or rationalizing negative information about themselves and their in-group. Finally, he discusses whether Judaism has ceased to be an evolutionary strategy because of the current levels of intermarriage among some groups of diaspora Jews, arguing that it has not ceased to be so and that it continues to flourish.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''The Culture of Critique'' (1998)===\n\nMacDonald examines [[Franz Boas#Later career: academic anthropology|Boasian anthropology]], [[political radicalism]], [[psychoanalysis]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and [[The New York Intellectuals]], arguing that Jews dominated these intellectual movements and that a strong sense of Jewish identity was characteristic of the great majority of the individuals in these movements. He argues that these individuals were pursuing a Jewish ethnic agenda in establishing and participating in these movements, while writing that the Jewish community does not constitute a unified movement and that only a small and elite minority of that community participated in these movements.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\nHe claims Jewish efforts to shape [[Immigration to the United States|United States immigration policy]] were in opposition to what he sees as the interests of the peoples of non-Jewish European descent, particularly the peoples of Northern and Western Europe. He concludes the book by claiming that intellectual movements he examines are movements that are either \"Jewish\" by nature or Jewish-controlled, with baleful results: \"the result has been a widening gulf between the cultural successes of Jews and Gentiles and a disaster for society as a whole.\"{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\nDescribing the evolution of his thinking over the course of his writing the trilogy, MacDonald says in his preface to the 2002 paperback edition of ''The Culture of Critique'':\n<blockquote>I think there is a noticeable shift in my tone from the first book to the third simply because (I'd like to think) I knew a lot more and had read a lot more. People often say after reading the first book that they think I really admire Jews, but they are unlikely to say that about the last two and especially about ''CofC''. That is because by the time I wrote ''CofC'' I had changed greatly from the person who wrote the first book.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html preface to the paperback edition of The Culture of Critique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006031740/http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html |date=2006-10-06 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Understanding Jewish Influence'' (2004)===\n\nWith introduction by [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] political writer [[Samuel T.

To MacDonald these traits consist of:\n\n*Hyper-[[ethnocentrism]]\n*High [[verbal intelligence]] and consequent [[wealth]]\n*Psychological intensity\n*Social and political aggression\n\nHe goes on to assert the influence of these traits upon current events concerning [[Zionism]], [[neoconservatism]], [[immigration]], and Middle Eastern warfare waged by [[Western world|Western]] powers.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe series has been widely criticized by academics and researchers as antisemitic and scientifically unsupportable.\n\n''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine carried an article by [[Judith Shulevitz]], then Art and Entertainment editor of the Culturebox, entitled \"Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite,\" continuing the discussion followed by an attempted rebuttal by MacDonald.  According to Shulevitz, MacDonald's arguments are prescriptive: \"Toward the end of the third book, MacDonald lays out his solution for restoring what he calls 'parity' between the Jews and other ethnic groups: systematic discrimination against Jews in college admission and employment and heavy taxation of Jews 'to counter the Jewish advantage in the possession of wealth'\".<ref name=\"Slate\">[http://primary.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/culturebox/2000/01/evolutionary_psychologys_antisemite.html Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite - Judith Shulevitz - Slate Magazine]</ref> MacDonald replied that in the actual passage from ''The Culture of Critique'' quoted by Shulevitz, he was speaking hypothetically of the consequences of competition between ethnic groups of differing abilities.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/quote.html quote]</ref>\nMark Potok of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has said of MacDonald that \"he put the anti-Semitism under the guise of scholarly work...

According to the ADL, MacDonald's views on Jews mimic those of antisemites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n===Academic response===\n\nIn a letter to ''Slate'' magazine, [[Harvard University]] psychology professor [[Steven Pinker]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The suggestion that scholars \"can't ignore bad ideas\" is a nonstarter. In science there are a thousand bad ideas for every good one. \"Doing battle\" against all of them is not an option for mere mortals, and doing battle against some of them is a tacit acknowledgment that those have enough merit to exceed the onerous threshold of attention-worthiness. MacDonald's ideas, as presented in summaries that would serve as a basis for further examination, do not pass that threshold, for many reasons: <br>\n\n1. By stating that Jews promulgate scientific hypotheses because they are Jewish, he is engaging in ''[[ad hominem]]'' argumentation that is outside the bounds of normal scientific discourse and an obvious waste of time to engage. MacDonald has already announced that I will reject his ideas because I am Jewish, so what's the point of replying to them? <br>\n\n2. MacDonald's main axioms &ndash; group selection of behavioral adaptations, and behaviorally relevant genetic cohesiveness of ethnic groups &ndash; are opposed by powerful bodies of data and theory, which Tooby, Cosmides, and many other evolutionary psychologists have written about in detail. Of course any assumption can be questioned, but there are no signs that MacDonald has taken on the burden of proof of showing that the majority view is wrong. <br>\n\n3. MacDonald's various theses, even if worthy of scientific debate individually, collectively add up to a consistently invidious portrayal of Jews, couched in value-laden, disparaging language. It is impossible to avoid the impression that this is not an ordinary scientific hypothesis. <br>\n\n4. The argument, as presented in the summaries, fails two basic tests of scientific credibility: a control group (in this case, other minority ethnic groups), and a comparison with alternative hypotheses (such as [[Thomas Sowell]]'s convincing analysis of \"middlemen minorities\" such as the Jews, presented in his magisterial study of migration, race, conquest, and culture).<ref name=\"fringe\">[http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/slatedialog.html Slate Magazine Dialogue On: How To Deal With Fringe Academics]</ref>\n</blockquote> Pinker closed by commenting that he had \"not plowed through MacDonald's trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments, and of not refuting them resoundingly enough\".<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nA paper by David Lieberman, a Holocaust researcher at [[Brandeis University]], alleges that MacDonald has distorted evidence and chosen evidence selectively for rhetorical purposes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010609074310/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_01.html MacDonald - Schatz: 1 of 3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[John Tooby]], past president of the [[Human Behavior and Evolution Society]] and a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], insists that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist, and that he advocates a generally discredited view of natural selection. Tooby, the founder of MacDonald's field of evolutionary psychology, criticized MacDonald in an article for the ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' website in 2000: \"MacDonald's ideas\u2014not just on Jews\u2014violate fundamental principles of the field\".<ref name=SPLC2/>\n\nReviewing MacDonald's ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy'' in ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', [[Sander Gilman]], professor of the Liberal Arts and Medicine at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] describes MacDonald's arguments about a Jewish group evolutionary strategy as \"bizarre\". According to Gilman, \"MacDonald recasts all of the hoary old myths about Jewish psychological difference and its presumed link to Jewish superior intelligence in contemporary sociobiological garb\". Gilman also charges that \"MacDonald manipulates his sources rather shamelessly\", including Gilman's own work. Gilman concludes that MacDonald's book \"is the most recent chapter in the continued myth-building concerning Jewish superior intelligence and achievement. It is, like the numerous earlier works, of interest in how positive images turn into the means by which Jewish difference is stressed and Jewish acculturation is shown to be pathological\".<ref name=Gilman>{{cite journal |last1=Gilman |first1=Sander L. |authorlink1=Sander Gilman |title=Review of A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=1995 |volume=86 |issue=1/2 |pages=198\u2013201 |doi=10.2307/1454833 |jstor=1454833 }}</ref>\n\nReviewing Macdonald's ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone'' in the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Eugen Schoenfeld, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at [[Georgia State University]], commented that \"the book is controversial, not only because of its theoretical approach, but also, and perhaps primarily, because of sloppy scholarship\". Schoenfeld writes that Macdonald \"selects historical incidents that can be used to support his thesis and conveniently omits others that challenge his thesis\". Schoenfeld points to what he sees as Macdonald's \"unfamiliarity with both the sociological frame of reference and historical knowledge\", and as an example, notes that Macdonald's comparison of Jewish collectivism during the biblical period with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English individualism \"indicates a total ignorance of the impact of industrialization on Western societies\".<ref name=\"Eugen\">Eugen Schoenfeld.

MacDonald also notes a negative shift in tone from the first book to the third, and attributes it to having learned more, read more, and \"changed greatly\" in that time.

He examines evidence from Jewish history, culture, and genetics supporting his thesis, arguing that Judaism is based on a strong -- and possibly genetically based -- predisposition to [[ethnocentrism]] characteristic of Middle Eastern cultures generally but exacerbated as a result of selective effects resulting from Jewish cultural practices. He considers the use of the complex and extensive Jewish scriptures and the high prestige of [[Rabbinic]] learning as [[eugenics|eugenic]] mechanisms for promoting Jewish verbal intelligence and [[dexterity]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''Separation and Its Discontents'' (1998)===\n\nDeveloping his work in ''A People that Shall Dwell Alone'', MacDonald examines antisemitism as a test case for an evolutionary analysis of ethnic conflict in general, applying social identity theory to three critical periods of institutionalized antisemitism: the Roman Empire in the fourth century; the [[Spanish Inquisition|Iberian inquisitions from the fourteenth century]]; and [[Nazi Germany|German Nazism]] in the period 1933-45. He argues that antisemitism can be analysed as a consequence of resource competition between groups in which each group is rationally pursuing its own interests, rather than as a manifestation of irrational malice by non-Jewish out-groups, and asserts that Jews, particularly strongly identified Jews, will be relatively prone to self-deception by ignoring or rationalizing negative information about themselves and their in-group. Finally, he discusses whether Judaism has ceased to be an evolutionary strategy because of the current levels of intermarriage among some groups of diaspora Jews, arguing that it has not ceased to be so and that it continues to flourish.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''The Culture of Critique'' (1998)===\n\nMacDonald examines [[Franz Boas#Later career: academic anthropology|Boasian anthropology]], [[political radicalism]], [[psychoanalysis]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and [[The New York Intellectuals]], arguing that Jews dominated these intellectual movements and that a strong sense of Jewish identity was characteristic of the great majority of the individuals in these movements. He argues that these individuals were pursuing a Jewish ethnic agenda in establishing and participating in these movements, while writing that the Jewish community does not constitute a unified movement and that only a small and elite minority of that community participated in these movements.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\nHe claims Jewish efforts to shape [[Immigration to the United States|United States immigration policy]] were in opposition to what he sees as the interests of the peoples of non-Jewish European descent, particularly the peoples of Northern and Western Europe. He concludes the book by claiming that intellectual movements he examines are movements that are either \"Jewish\" by nature or Jewish-controlled, with baleful results: \"the result has been a widening gulf between the cultural successes of Jews and Gentiles and a disaster for society as a whole.\"{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\nDescribing the evolution of his thinking over the course of his writing the trilogy, MacDonald says in his preface to the 2002 paperback edition of ''The Culture of Critique'':\n<blockquote>I think there is a noticeable shift in my tone from the first book to the third simply because (I'd like to think) I knew a lot more and had read a lot more. People often say after reading the first book that they think I really admire Jews, but they are unlikely to say that about the last two and especially about ''CofC''. That is because by the time I wrote ''CofC'' I had changed greatly from the person who wrote the first book.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html preface to the paperback edition of The Culture of Critique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006031740/http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html |date=2006-10-06 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Understanding Jewish Influence'' (2004)===\n\nWith introduction by [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] political writer [[Samuel T.

To MacDonald these traits consist of:\n\n*Hyper-[[ethnocentrism]]\n*High [[verbal intelligence]] and consequent [[wealth]]\n*Psychological intensity\n*Social and political aggression\n\nHe goes on to assert the influence of these traits upon current events concerning [[Zionism]], [[neoconservatism]], [[immigration]], and Middle Eastern warfare waged by [[Western world|Western]] powers.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe series has been widely criticized by academics and researchers as antisemitic and scientifically unsupportable.\n\n''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine carried an article by [[Judith Shulevitz]], then Art and Entertainment editor of the Culturebox, entitled \"Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite,\" continuing the discussion followed by an attempted rebuttal by MacDonald.  According to Shulevitz, MacDonald's arguments are prescriptive: \"Toward the end of the third book, MacDonald lays out his solution for restoring what he calls 'parity' between the Jews and other ethnic groups: systematic discrimination against Jews in college admission and employment and heavy taxation of Jews 'to counter the Jewish advantage in the possession of wealth'\".<ref name=\"Slate\">[http://primary.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/culturebox/2000/01/evolutionary_psychologys_antisemite.html Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite - Judith Shulevitz - Slate Magazine]</ref> MacDonald replied that in the actual passage from ''The Culture of Critique'' quoted by Shulevitz, he was speaking hypothetically of the consequences of competition between ethnic groups of differing abilities.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/quote.html quote]</ref>\nMark Potok of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has said of MacDonald that \"he put the anti-Semitism under the guise of scholarly work...

According to the ADL, MacDonald's views on Jews mimic those of antisemites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n===Academic response===\n\nIn a letter to ''Slate'' magazine, [[Harvard University]] psychology professor [[Steven Pinker]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The suggestion that scholars \"can't ignore bad ideas\" is a nonstarter. In science there are a thousand bad ideas for every good one. \"Doing battle\" against all of them is not an option for mere mortals, and doing battle against some of them is a tacit acknowledgment that those have enough merit to exceed the onerous threshold of attention-worthiness. MacDonald's ideas, as presented in summaries that would serve as a basis for further examination, do not pass that threshold, for many reasons: <br>\n\n1. By stating that Jews promulgate scientific hypotheses because they are Jewish, he is engaging in ''[[ad hominem]]'' argumentation that is outside the bounds of normal scientific discourse and an obvious waste of time to engage. MacDonald has already announced that I will reject his ideas because I am Jewish, so what's the point of replying to them? <br>\n\n2. MacDonald's main axioms &ndash; group selection of behavioral adaptations, and behaviorally relevant genetic cohesiveness of ethnic groups &ndash; are opposed by powerful bodies of data and theory, which Tooby, Cosmides, and many other evolutionary psychologists have written about in detail. Of course any assumption can be questioned, but there are no signs that MacDonald has taken on the burden of proof of showing that the majority view is wrong. <br>\n\n3. MacDonald's various theses, even if worthy of scientific debate individually, collectively add up to a consistently invidious portrayal of Jews, couched in value-laden, disparaging language. It is impossible to avoid the impression that this is not an ordinary scientific hypothesis. <br>\n\n4. The argument, as presented in the summaries, fails two basic tests of scientific credibility: a control group (in this case, other minority ethnic groups), and a comparison with alternative hypotheses (such as [[Thomas Sowell]]'s convincing analysis of \"middlemen minorities\" such as the Jews, presented in his magisterial study of migration, race, conquest, and culture).<ref name=\"fringe\">[http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/slatedialog.html Slate Magazine Dialogue On: How To Deal With Fringe Academics]</ref>\n</blockquote> Pinker closed by commenting that he had \"not plowed through MacDonald's trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments, and of not refuting them resoundingly enough\".<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nA paper by David Lieberman, a Holocaust researcher at [[Brandeis University]], alleges that MacDonald has distorted evidence and chosen evidence selectively for rhetorical purposes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010609074310/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_01.html MacDonald - Schatz: 1 of 3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[John Tooby]], past president of the [[Human Behavior and Evolution Society]] and a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], insists that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist, and that he advocates a generally discredited view of natural selection.

According to Gilman, \"MacDonald recasts all of the hoary old myths about Jewish psychological difference and its presumed link to Jewish superior intelligence in contemporary sociobiological garb\". Gilman also charges that \"MacDonald manipulates his sources rather shamelessly\", including Gilman's own work. Gilman concludes that MacDonald's book \"is the most recent chapter in the continued myth-building concerning Jewish superior intelligence and achievement. It is, like the numerous earlier works, of interest in how positive images turn into the means by which Jewish difference is stressed and Jewish acculturation is shown to be pathological\".<ref name=Gilman>{{cite journal |last1=Gilman |first1=Sander L. |authorlink1=Sander Gilman |title=Review of A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=1995 |volume=86 |issue=1/2 |pages=198\u2013201 |doi=10.2307/1454833 |jstor=1454833 }}</ref>\n\nReviewing Macdonald's ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone'' in the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Eugen Schoenfeld, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at [[Georgia State University]], commented that \"the book is controversial, not only because of its theoretical approach, but also, and perhaps primarily, because of sloppy scholarship\". Schoenfeld writes that Macdonald \"selects historical incidents that can be used to support his thesis and conveniently omits others that challenge his thesis\". Schoenfeld points to what he sees as Macdonald's \"unfamiliarity with both the sociological frame of reference and historical knowledge\", and as an example, notes that Macdonald's comparison of Jewish collectivism during the biblical period with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English individualism \"indicates a total ignorance of the impact of industrialization on Western societies\".<ref name=\"Eugen\">Eugen Schoenfeld.

{"title_page": "Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2016}}\nThe '''Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud''' of 1455 engendered a series of raids, sieges, and attacks between two major [[Devon]] families, the [[House of Courtenay#The English House of Courtenay|Courtenays]] and the [[Baron Bonville|Bonvilles]], in [[south west England]], in the mid-fifteenth century. One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became entwined with national politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]] were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, had become more powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry spilled over into physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.\n is often given as an example of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often considered it a cause of the later [[Wars of the Roses]]; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at [[Clyst Heath|Clyst]] (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near [[Exeter]], which resulted in loss of life.\n\nThe events at Clyst  resulted in government intervention in the politics of the west country. This was unusual, as the government did not have a good track-record of settling local disputes among the nobility. However, it is likely that this was done for reasons of higher politics; [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|William Bonville]] was by 1455 a Yorkist, and [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] had been made [[Lord Protector]]. Although in the short term it resulted in [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]]'s incarceration, the Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud did not come to an effective end until the protagonists were all killed in the early years of the civil wars.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tiverton , Tiverton Castle Ruins - geograph.org.uk - 1272097.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tiverton Castle]] ruins, the [[family seat]] of the Courtenays]]\nThe mid-fifteenth century suffered greatly from the private [[feud]]s of the [[nobility]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]] in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 252</ref> This was between [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]], whose family had been [[Earl of Devon|earls of that county]] since 1335<ref>Cokayne, G.E. & Gibbs, V.,(ed.), ''The Complete Peerage of Great Britain and Ireland'', 16 vols, rev. (London, 1916), 323</ref> and [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, [[historian]] Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.<ref>Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 76</ref>\n\n===National context===\n{{Main|Wars of the Roses}}\n[[File:Courtenay-Earl of Devon COA.svg|thumb|[[Armorial]] of the Courtenay Earls of Devon]]\nIn 1966, historian [[R. L. Storey]] suggested that the [[civil war]]s which racked England for much of the fifteenth century had their origins in the breakdown of both the king's ability to govern, and law and order in the localities, and gave the Courtenay\u2013Bonville feud as one such example.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165\u201376.</ref> The king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], had been incapacitated by mental illness in August 1453.<ref name=\"Wagner2001\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXnWRMt6uoC&pg=PA113|title=Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2001|isbn=978-1-85109-358-8|pages=113\u2013|author=John A.

York and his closest allies, his brother-in-law [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury]] and Salisbury's son [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], anticipated that charges might be brought against them at this assembly. They gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at [[St Albans]]. Both militarily and politically it was a complete victory for York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] they captured the king and retook their places in government, while York's and the Nevilles' rivals, the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford|Lord Clifford]] were killed.<ref>Goodman, A., ''The Wars of the Roses: Military Activity and English Society, 1452\u201397'', (London, 1981), 24</ref> Among the royalists wounded were the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and Somerset's son the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Earl of Dorset]], the [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], and the king's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor]].<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 110.</ref> York was appointed Protector of England, for the second time, by parliament a few months later.<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 114</ref>\n\nProfessor [[Ralph A. Griffiths]] places the fault for the feud between the Courtenays and Bonvilles firmly in the lap of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], through whose \"thoughtless liberality and government carelessness&nbsp;... personal jealousies in the [[west country]] had been exacerbated.\"<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 577</ref> However, more recently, Martin Cherry warned against seeing the feud as the same as the later civil wars writ small; they were, he says, \"qualitatively\" different, resulting in the ultimate disintegration of the earl's affinity, rather than symptomatic of his violence.<ref>Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 77</ref> [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] has pointed out that although there were many other regional feuds at this time (including the [[John Talbot, 1st Viscount Lisle#Aggressive acquisition|Lisle]]-[[Berkeley family|Berkeley]] dispute, also waged in the west country), they did not have the same causes, or were necessarily caused by weak government at all: for instance, whereas the Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud had territorial domination at its root, others, such as the Berkeley\u2013Lisle dispute, were begun over contested [[inheritance]]s.<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' (Totton, 2012), 96</ref> Cherry has also suggested that the main cause of the Bonville\u2013Courtenay dispute was the desperation of the earl to \"gain access to crown patronage for himself and his clients\" \u2013 something he was gradually failing to do in the face of competition.<ref>Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A.

The rivalry between them stemmed from the fact that they were major [[estate (land)|estate]] holders in the south west, and further, because both had claims to crown patronage. For example, William Bonville had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] for both Henry VI and his father, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], whilst Devon through [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|his wife]] was the king's cousin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1912\">Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 253</ref> Although the earl was both the greatest landowner and the highest ranking nobleman in the county, he had in recent years seen members of the lesser gentry and nobility (such as William Bonville) receive advancement in his stead.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\">Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574</ref> Bonville had also furthered his own advancement by successively marrying into the lower nobility (a daughter of the [[Reynold Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Ruthin|Lord Grey of Ruthin]]) and then to an aunt of the Earl of Devon himself.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\"/> The main royal office in the area \u2013  and therefore the main source of royal patronage \u2013  was the stewardship of the highly profitable [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. Both men had held the office alternately over recent years. Tensions between the two have been traced back to 1437, when the stewardship was taken from Courtenay and granted to William Bonville. Courtenay did receive a royal grant of \u00a3100 ''per annum'' [[life annuity]] at this time. But, says Griffiths, this is unlikely to have made up for loss of the main royal office in the county.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574\u20135</ref> Certainly, within two years, severe attacks were being launched on Bonville's property, and by 1440, relations between the two were, Griffiths says, \"at breaking point.\" This tension became apparent in open manifestations of military strength; manifestations worrying enough to government to lead to them both being summoned before council.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 575</ref> In 1441 the stewardship was returned to the Earl of Devon, although Radford questions whether Bonville actually ever physically surrendered the office, as in November that year an [[arbitration]] took place between them to \"end all [of their] differences.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1912\"/>\n\nThere followed a four-year period of peace; but this could simply be accounted for by the fact that Bonville spent that time in service in [[Gascony]], which, it has been suggested, may have been one of the conditions of the arbitration.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> It was, though, only a temporary peace for the region as by 1449 the earl besieged Bonville (now promoted to the [[baronage]] in recognition of his success in France)<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 576</ref> in his castle of [[Taunton Castle|Taunton]] for a year.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 254</ref> Courtenay supported [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] in his 1452 rebellion at [[Dartford]], even joining him in the field against the king. This [[treason]] resulted in him forfeiting his royal offices in the south west, including not only the stewardship of the duchy \u2013 which was finally granted to Bonville for life \u2013 but [[Lydford Castle]], the [[Forest of Dartmoor]], and the [[River Exe|Water of Exe]].<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 255</ref> Hence, as his ally the duke was eclipsed in government, Courtenay was eclipsed by Bonville in the south west. Courtenay had \u2013  in imitation of his ally \u2013  waged a local war against Bonville and Bonville's ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]], between 1451\u20135. Raising an army of 5\u20136,000 men, he forced Wiltshire to desert his manor of Lackham, and then returned to the siege of Taunton. The siege was only lifted when the Duke of York arrived unannounced three days later, and took the castle into his own hands, forcing a peace upon the two parties.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\nBonville had, then, by April 1455, received much royal favour, including all the offices the earl had lost, as well as the constableship of [[Rougemont Castle|Exeter Castle]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1966\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165</ref> He was \u2013  as one historian has called him \u2013  \"the King's lieutenant in the west.\" The Earl of Devon had already reacted against this hegemony during the Duke of York's first protectorate (1454\u20135) and joined the [[Curia regis|royal council]]. However, it appears that even the council itself did not trust him to keep the [[Queen's peace|King's peace]], as they placed him under a bond of \u00a31,000 to do so. This he had disregarded,<ref name=\"autogenerated1966\"/> and commenced another campaign against Bonville. This time, the Earl of Devon was accompanied by his sons, and, bringing a force of men into [[Exeter]] in April 1455, he attempted to ambush Bonville. This resulted in further government-imposed undertakings of good behaviour between the two parties. As the government was now headed by Courtenay's old ally, the Duke of York, it is likely that it was now that the earl decided to reject his alliance with York and give his support to the crown. He fought (and was wounded) at [[First Battle of St Albans|St Albans]] on 22 May that year, on the side of the king.<ref>Roskell, J.S., ''The Commons in the Parliament of 1422'' (Manchester, 1954), 155.</ref> Bonville, meanwhile, through his wife, was related to the Harrington family of [[Hornby-with-Farleton|Hornby]], [[Lancashire]], who had close links to the [[House of Neville|Nevilles]] \u2013  his father-in-law was [[Thomas Harrington (knight)|Thomas Harrington]], a [[feoffee]] and [[Bastard feudalism|retainer]] to the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]]. Bonville's new-found [[House of York|Yorkist]] sympathies seem to have driven the Earl of Devon to even greater violence in the county.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 166</ref>\n\n==The murder of Nicholas Radford==\n[[File:Tower, Exeter castle (geograph 3468003).jpg|thumb|left|Tower at Exeter castle]]\nFrom October 1455, Devon and his sons were committing acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the administrative machinery of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] under the leadership of Devon's eldest son, [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]]. It was this force that was to be guilty of what [[R. L. Storey]] has called \"the most notorious private crime of the century,\" due not only to the violence involved but the fact that it was \"so obviously premeditated.\"<ref>Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 167</ref> This force made its way to [[Upcott, Cheriton Fitzpaine|Upcott]] on 23 October 1455, the home of [[Nicholas Radford]], a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of the city of Exeter and [[member of parliament]]. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon and his sons for the very reason that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past;<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 168</ref> and in January 1455 he had [[enfeoffed]] Bonville (and others) for land valued at \u00a3400.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 136</ref>\n\nThomas Courtenay's force attacked Radford's manor that night; they set fire to the wall and gates to draw him out. On their word, including Courtenay's solemn promise to do him no harm if he would speak with them, Radford let them in \u2013 although apparently he commented upon their large number. Whilst Radford and Devon's son drank wine, the latter's followers \"ransacked\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> Radford's house, stealing goods up to the value of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], including all his horses and the sheets off his [[Patient|invalid]] wife's bed.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 169</ref> On a pretext of meeting his father the earl, Courtenay persuaded Radford to accompany him when his force withdrew; however, he abandoned Radford on the road a short distance from the house, and six of Courtenay's men killed him.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/> Devon subsequently dispatched a force to the [[chapel]] where Radford's body was; they performed, says Storey, a \"mock inquest, one of them acting as coroner and others, with assumed names, as jurors. They brought in a verdict of [[suicide]].\"<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/> They then forced Radford's servants to convey his corpse as if he had been a [[Heresy|heretic]] to the graveyard, where it was deposited unceremoniously into an open grave; the stones laid ready to build his memorial were then dropped on the body, crushing it. By making recognition of the body impossible, this prevented an official [[inquest]] being held into Radford's death.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/>\n\n==Following the murder==\nThe murder of Nicholas Radford, says R. L. Storey, was only \"the curtain raiser\" for further military activities. Devon proceeded to raise a force and occupy Exeter \u2013 \"as if they were the city's lawful garrison\" \u2013 until just before Christmas, seizing the [[Freedom of the City|keys of the city]];<ref name=\"autogenerated7\">Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 257</ref> various houses in the city belonging to Bonville and his supporters were ransacked, and members of the [[Exeter Cathedral|Cathedral]] were arrested and forced to buy their freedom. In one case, a man was bodily removed from the choir whilst celebrating [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. Both Bonville and Courtenay had 'extensive relations' with the Cathedral, dating back to the 1430s, but the Courtenays had greatly contributed to its expansion in the previous century.<ref>Attreed, L., 'Arbitration and the Growth of Urban Liberties in Late Medieval England', Journal of British Studies, 31 (1992), 227\u20138</ref> Their actions in 1455 were probably inspired by the fact that Radford had entrusted much of his wealth to the safe-keeping of the church, and Devon saw an opportunity to enrich himself; possibly, says Storey, he was forced to take such action to be able to pay his men.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 170</ref> Martin Cherry has pointed to the lack of references to any martial expenses on the earl's behalf in the extant accounts, as indicating that his campaign effectively paid for itself.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/>\n\nDuring the same period, Devon, \"in warlike fashion and like an insurrection\"<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/> also besieged [[Powderham Castle]], which belonged to his distant cousin and Bonville ally, Sir [[Philip Courtenay (died 1463)|Philip Courtenay]]; the latter resisted, and Bonville came to his assistance. Prior to doing this, however, he raided the Earl of Devon's house at [[Colcombe Castle]] and proceeded to ransack it. Bonville attempted to lift the siege at Powderham on 19 November, but was repulsed by Devon, and lost two men in the fight,<ref name=\"autogenerated8\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171</ref> which may have involved up to a thousand men.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 258</ref> Meanwhile, Devon continued his attempts to persuade the city of Exeter to raise a force on his behalf \u2013 which they refused to do \u2013 before leaving Exeter on 15 December,<ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/> as Bonville approached, on his way to Powderham. The two forces met at Clyst, just south west of Exeter.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 260</ref>\n\n==The fight at Clyst==\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]\nDevon marched from Exeter to encounter Bonville at [[Clyst Heath]]; there are very few extant sources for the event, and only one chronicler provides any details, saying he \"departed out of the city with his people into the field of Clyst, and there bickered and fought with the Lord Bonville and put them to flight, and so returned again that night into the city.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated9\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171\u20132</ref> Many bones were discovered when the site was excavated in 1800, although some, Storey points out, must belong to those killed in the [[Prayer Book Rebellion#Clyst Heath massaacre | 1549 engagement on the same site]]. Although difficult to assess the extent to which the engagement can be described as a battle (one chronicler estimated the dead at twelve men)<ref name=\"autogenerated10\">Cherry, M., 'The Crown & Political Society in Devon' (PhD thesis, University of Wales (Swansea), 1981), 307</ref> it does appear to have been decisive in Devon's favour. The earl returned to Exeter, where the [[Mayor of Exeter|mayor]] had \"tactfully\" laid on a celebration.<ref name=\"autogenerated9\"/> Hannes Kleineke has described the mayor's decision to illuminate the city walls on the earl's return as \"pragmatic\",<ref>Kleineke, H., '\"\u00fee Kynges Cite\"\u2013 Exeter in the Wars of the Roses', in Clarke, L. (ed.), ''Conflicts, Consequences and the Crown in the Later Middle Ages: The Fifteenth Century VII''  (Woodbridge, 2007), 156</ref> whilst Cherry explains the mayor's behaviour as being due to the fact that the earl, \"in his peculiar manner, [had behaved] punctiliously\" to the mayor.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" />\n\nThe earl subsequently sent a [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] led by [[Thomas Carrew]]<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172</ref> to attack Bonville's [[manor]] at [[Old Shute House#Bonville|Shute]] where they faced no resistance and pillaged freely, stealing Bonville's cattle, furnishings, and food.<ref>Orme, N., 'Representation and Rebellion in the Later Middle Ages', in Kain, R. & W. Ravenhill (eds.), ''Historical Atlas of South-West England'' (Exeter, 1999), 141, 144.</ref> The weeks preceding the battle had been accompanied by what has been called \"exchange[s] of formal declarations of war disguised in the chivalric mode of challenges to a duel.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" /> Michael Hicks has suggested that, in spite of the earl's clear superiority in numbers, it was Bonville who \"goaded the earl into a fair fight,\" and that \"in the spirit of chivalry\" the confrontation at Clyst was his fault.<ref>Hicks, M.A., The Wars of the Roses, (Yale, 2010), 116</ref> Cherry too has suggested that Bonville and Courtenay of Powderham deliberately attempted to recruit members of the earl's historical tenantry, further poisoning relations,<ref>Cherry, M. 'The Courtenay Earls of Devon: The Formation and Disintegration of a Late Medieval Aristocratic Affinity', ''Southern History'', 1 (1979), 95</ref> and also that, although doubtless the earl has deserved the 'universally bad press' he has received from modern historians, he was still \"reluctant to go to war,\" and that he did so \"only after all other methods of achieving his aims&nbsp;... had failed.\"<ref>Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A.

This was still under the control of Bonville's allies, York, Salisbury, and Warwick, but had up until that point the Yorkists had failed to intervene in this local feud. The feud has been described as an example of local activities influencing parliament itself,<ref>Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 59</ref> and Griffiths said it was used as \"a pretext for demanding York's appointment as protector.\"<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 755</ref> When parliament reassembled on 12 November it was presented with reports that Devon was leading an army of about 4,000 men and including 400 cavalry to London. The king was still incapacitated. Unable to manage the situation; the Duke of York used the immediate necessity for intervention as a mechanism for being formally appointed Protector. He did not immediately hasten to the south west to punish the Earl of Devon, though. The earl was merely dismissed from his role on the [[Justice of the peace|commission of the peace]] in early December.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172\u20133</ref> Soon after, the local gentry were ordered to be ready to assist York. The duke did not set out until news was received of the Clyst confrontation. One chronicler states that following his defeat, Bonville \"fled, and came to Grenewiche to the kyng, and the kyng sent him agayne to the lord protectour;\"<ref>Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 64</ref> although it is also possible that he was committed to the [[Fleet Prison]] for a short time.<ref>Cherry, M., 'The Crown & Political Society in Devon' (Ph.D thesis, University of Wales (Swansea) 1981), 303</ref> When finally York left for the south west, he summoned the Earl of Devon to [[Shaftesbury]] where the earl was arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]].<ref name=\"autogenerated11\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Earl of Devon remained imprisoned for only a few months. It is possible that an attempt was made to bring him to trial in February, but if so, it was probably \u2013 in Storey's words \u2013 \"countermanded.\" This could have been, he suggests, indicative of York's \"waning\" position, as the protectorate was soon to come to an end:<ref name=\"autogenerated11\"/> Cherry has said that the king's resumption of personal power in February 1456 must have come as \"a considerable relief\" to the earl.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\">Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138</ref> He seems to have taken the Yorkists' eclipse as a further opportunity to continue the feud, which provoked governmental admonishment in March, when his son [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John Courtenay]], with 500 armed men, again prevented the Exeter justices of the peace from sitting, and evicted them. [[Letters patent|Commissions]] of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' were issued in August, being led by Bonville's ally the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]].<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173\u20134</ref> Although Bonville presented a long list of offences committed by Devon to the council (whilst mitigating his own involvement), the crown \"was obviously unimpressed\" by this, and eventually not only restored Devon to commission of the peace (12 September 1456) but also pardoned him and his sons for any involvement in the murder of Radford, eventually even appointing him to the lucrative office of keeper of the forest and park of [[Clarendon Park, Wiltshire|Clarendon]].<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> The region subsequently remained quiet; Bonville was of advanced age and Devon was possibly unwell, as he died in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] within eighteen months.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174</ref> His will was executed by some of the most important men on the Queen's council.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/>\n\nThe region took no active part in the ensuing civil wars until the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471, but both parties to the feud were killed in the civil wars over the next few years. The new [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who had killed Radford, was a thorough supporter of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] regime. After the [[House of York|Yorkist]] victory at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] in June 1460, he took his troops northwards to [[Margaret of Anjou]]<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> in [[York]], where, in April 1461, he was executed by the new king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] after the [[Battle of Towton]]. Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Duke of York]] and the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] was summarily beheaded<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174\u20135</ref> \u2013 probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.<ref>Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A.

One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became entwined with national politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]] were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, had become more powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry spilled over into physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.\n\nThe Bonville-Courtenay feud is often given as an example of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often considered it a cause of the later [[Wars of the Roses]]; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at [[Clyst Heath|Clyst]] (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near [[Exeter]], which resulted in loss of life.\n\nThe events at Clyst  resulted in government intervention in the politics of the west country. This was unusual, as the government did not have a good track-record of settling local disputes among the nobility. However, it is likely that this was done for reasons of higher politics; [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|William Bonville]] was by 1455 a Yorkist, and [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] had been made [[Lord Protector]]. Although in the short term it resulted in [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]]'s incarceration, the Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud did not come to an effective end until the protagonists were all killed in the early years of the civil wars.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tiverton , Tiverton Castle Ruins - geograph.org.uk - 1272097.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tiverton Castle]] ruins, the [[family seat]] of the Courtenays]]\nThe mid-fifteenth century suffered greatly from the private [[feud]]s of the [[nobility]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]] in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 252</ref> This was between [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]], whose family had been [[Earl of Devon|earls of that county]] since 1335<ref>Cokayne, G.E. & Gibbs, V.,(ed.), ''The Complete Peerage of Great Britain and Ireland'', 16 vols, rev. (London, 1916), 323</ref> and [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, [[historian]] Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.<ref>Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 76</ref>\n\n===National context===\n{{Main|Wars of the Roses}}\n[[File:Courtenay-Earl of Devon COA.svg|thumb|[[Armorial]] of the Courtenay Earls of Devon]]\nIn 1966, historian [[R.

They gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at [[St Albans]]. Both militarily and politically it was a complete victory for York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] they captured the king and retook their places in government, while York's and the Nevilles' rivals, the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford|Lord Clifford]] were killed.<ref>Goodman, A., ''The Wars of the Roses: Military Activity and English Society, 1452\u201397'', (London, 1981), 24</ref> Among the royalists wounded were the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and Somerset's son the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Earl of Dorset]], the [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], and the king's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor]].<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 110.</ref> York was appointed Protector of England, for the second time, by parliament a few months later.<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 114</ref>\n\nProfessor [[Ralph A. Griffiths]] places the fault for the feud between the Courtenays and Bonvilles firmly in the lap of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], through whose \"thoughtless liberality and government carelessness&nbsp;... personal jealousies in the [[west country]] had been exacerbated.\"<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 577</ref> However, more recently, Martin Cherry warned against seeing the feud as the same as the later civil wars writ small; they were, he says, \"qualitatively\" different, resulting in the ultimate disintegration of the earl's affinity, rather than symptomatic of his violence.<ref>Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 77</ref> [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] has pointed out that although there were many other regional feuds at this time (including the [[John Talbot, 1st Viscount Lisle#Aggressive acquisition|Lisle]]-[[Berkeley family|Berkeley]] dispute, also waged in the west country), they did not have the same causes, or were necessarily caused by weak government at all: for instance, whereas the Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud had territorial domination at its root, others, such as the Berkeley\u2013Lisle dispute, were begun over contested [[inheritance]]s.<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' (Totton, 2012), 96</ref> Cherry has also suggested that the main cause of the Bonville\u2013Courtenay dispute was the desperation of the earl to \"gain access to crown patronage for himself and his clients\" \u2013 something he was gradually failing to do in the face of competition.<ref>Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 123\u20134</ref>\n\n===Local politics===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, KG.png|thumb|Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]\nAs noted, the feud between the Bonvilles and Courtenays was rooted in local Devonshire politics. The rivalry between them stemmed from the fact that they were major [[estate (land)|estate]] holders in the south west, and further, because both had claims to crown patronage. For example, William Bonville had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] for both Henry VI and his father, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], whilst Devon through [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|his wife]] was the king's cousin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1912\">Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 253</ref> Although the earl was both the greatest landowner and the highest ranking nobleman in the county, he had in recent years seen members of the lesser gentry and nobility (such as William Bonville) receive advancement in his stead.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\">Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574</ref> Bonville had also furthered his own advancement by successively marrying into the lower nobility (a daughter of the [[Reynold Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Ruthin|Lord Grey of Ruthin]]) and then to an aunt of the Earl of Devon himself.<ref name=\"autogenerated1981\"/> The main royal office in the area \u2013  and therefore the main source of royal patronage \u2013  was the stewardship of the highly profitable [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. Both men had held the office alternately over recent years. Tensions between the two have been traced back to 1437, when the stewardship was taken from Courtenay and granted to William Bonville. Courtenay did receive a royal grant of \u00a3100 ''per annum'' [[life annuity]] at this time. But, says Griffiths, this is unlikely to have made up for loss of the main royal office in the county.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574\u20135</ref> Certainly, within two years, severe attacks were being launched on Bonville's property, and by 1440, relations between the two were, Griffiths says, \"at breaking point.\" This tension became apparent in open manifestations of military strength; manifestations worrying enough to government to lead to them both being summoned before council.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 575</ref> In 1441 the stewardship was returned to the Earl of Devon, although Radford questions whether Bonville actually ever physically surrendered the office, as in November that year an [[arbitration]] took place between them to \"end all [of their] differences.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1912\"/>\n\nThere followed a four-year period of peace; but this could simply be accounted for by the fact that Bonville spent that time in service in [[Gascony]], which, it has been suggested, may have been one of the conditions of the arbitration.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> It was, though, only a temporary peace for the region as by 1449 the earl besieged Bonville (now promoted to the [[baronage]] in recognition of his success in France)<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 576</ref> in his castle of [[Taunton Castle|Taunton]] for a year.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 254</ref> Courtenay supported [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] in his 1452 rebellion at [[Dartford]], even joining him in the field against the king. This [[treason]] resulted in him forfeiting his royal offices in the south west, including not only the stewardship of the duchy \u2013 which was finally granted to Bonville for life \u2013 but [[Lydford Castle]], the [[Forest of Dartmoor]], and the [[River Exe|Water of Exe]].<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 255</ref> Hence, as his ally the duke was eclipsed in government, Courtenay was eclipsed by Bonville in the south west. Courtenay had \u2013  in imitation of his ally \u2013  waged a local war against Bonville and Bonville's ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]], between 1451\u20135. Raising an army of 5\u20136,000 men, he forced Wiltshire to desert his manor of Lackham, and then returned to the siege of Taunton. The siege was only lifted when the Duke of York arrived unannounced three days later, and took the castle into his own hands, forcing a peace upon the two parties.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\nBonville had, then, by April 1455, received much royal favour, including all the offices the earl had lost, as well as the constableship of [[Rougemont Castle|Exeter Castle]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1966\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165</ref> He was \u2013  as one historian has called him \u2013  \"the King's lieutenant in the west.\" The Earl of Devon had already reacted against this hegemony during the Duke of York's first protectorate (1454\u20135) and joined the [[Curia regis|royal council]]. However, it appears that even the council itself did not trust him to keep the [[Queen's peace|King's peace]], as they placed him under a bond of \u00a31,000 to do so. This he had disregarded,<ref name=\"autogenerated1966\"/> and commenced another campaign against Bonville. This time, the Earl of Devon was accompanied by his sons, and, bringing a force of men into [[Exeter]] in April 1455, he attempted to ambush Bonville. This resulted in further government-imposed undertakings of good behaviour between the two parties. As the government was now headed by Courtenay's old ally, the Duke of York, it is likely that it was now that the earl decided to reject his alliance with York and give his support to the crown. He fought (and was wounded) at [[First Battle of St Albans|St Albans]] on 22 May that year, on the side of the king.<ref>Roskell, J.S., ''The Commons in the Parliament of 1422'' (Manchester, 1954), 155.</ref> Bonville, meanwhile, through his wife, was related to the Harrington family of [[Hornby-with-Farleton|Hornby]], [[Lancashire]], who had close links to the [[House of Neville|Nevilles]] \u2013  his father-in-law was [[Thomas Harrington (knight)|Thomas Harrington]], a [[feoffee]] and [[Bastard feudalism|retainer]] to the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]]. Bonville's new-found [[House of York|Yorkist]] sympathies seem to have driven the Earl of Devon to even greater violence in the county.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 166</ref>\n\n==The murder of Nicholas Radford==\n[[File:Tower, Exeter castle (geograph 3468003).jpg|thumb|left|Tower at Exeter castle]]\nFrom October 1455, Devon and his sons were committing acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the administrative machinery of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] under the leadership of Devon's eldest son, [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]]. It was this force that was to be guilty of what [[R. L. Storey]] has called \"the most notorious private crime of the century,\" due not only to the violence involved but the fact that it was \"so obviously premeditated.\"<ref>Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 167</ref> This force made its way to [[Upcott, Cheriton Fitzpaine|Upcott]] on 23 October 1455, the home of [[Nicholas Radford]], a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of the city of Exeter and [[member of parliament]]. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon and his sons for the very reason that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past;<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 168</ref> and in January 1455 he had [[enfeoffed]] Bonville (and others) for land valued at \u00a3400.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 136</ref>\n\nThomas Courtenay's force attacked Radford's manor that night; they set fire to the wall and gates to draw him out. On their word, including Courtenay's solemn promise to do him no harm if he would speak with them, Radford let them in \u2013 although apparently he commented upon their large number. Whilst Radford and Devon's son drank wine, the latter's followers \"ransacked\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> Radford's house, stealing goods up to the value of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], including all his horses and the sheets off his [[Patient|invalid]] wife's bed.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 169</ref> On a pretext of meeting his father the earl, Courtenay persuaded Radford to accompany him when his force withdrew; however, he abandoned Radford on the road a short distance from the house, and six of Courtenay's men killed him.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/> Devon subsequently dispatched a force to the [[chapel]] where Radford's body was; they performed, says Storey, a \"mock inquest, one of them acting as coroner and others, with assumed names, as jurors. They brought in a verdict of [[suicide]].\"<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/> They then forced Radford's servants to convey his corpse as if he had been a [[Heresy|heretic]] to the graveyard, where it was deposited unceremoniously into an open grave; the stones laid ready to build his memorial were then dropped on the body, crushing it. By making recognition of the body impossible, this prevented an official [[inquest]] being held into Radford's death.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/>\n\n==Following the murder==\nThe murder of Nicholas Radford, says R. L. Storey, was only \"the curtain raiser\" for further military activities. Devon proceeded to raise a force and occupy Exeter \u2013 \"as if they were the city's lawful garrison\" \u2013 until just before Christmas, seizing the [[Freedom of the City|keys of the city]];<ref name=\"autogenerated7\">Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 257</ref> various houses in the city belonging to Bonville and his supporters were ransacked, and members of the [[Exeter Cathedral|Cathedral]] were arrested and forced to buy their freedom. In one case, a man was bodily removed from the choir whilst celebrating [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. Both Bonville and Courtenay had 'extensive relations' with the Cathedral, dating back to the 1430s, but the Courtenays had greatly contributed to its expansion in the previous century.<ref>Attreed, L., 'Arbitration and the Growth of Urban Liberties in Late Medieval England', Journal of British Studies, 31 (1992), 227\u20138</ref> Their actions in 1455 were probably inspired by the fact that Radford had entrusted much of his wealth to the safe-keeping of the church, and Devon saw an opportunity to enrich himself; possibly, says Storey, he was forced to take such action to be able to pay his men.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 170</ref> Martin Cherry has pointed to the lack of references to any martial expenses on the earl's behalf in the extant accounts, as indicating that his campaign effectively paid for itself.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/>\n\nDuring the same period, Devon, \"in warlike fashion and like an insurrection\"<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/> also besieged [[Powderham Castle]], which belonged to his distant cousin and Bonville ally, Sir [[Philip Courtenay (died 1463)|Philip Courtenay]]; the latter resisted, and Bonville came to his assistance. Prior to doing this, however, he raided the Earl of Devon's house at [[Colcombe Castle]] and proceeded to ransack it. Bonville attempted to lift the siege at Powderham on 19 November, but was repulsed by Devon, and lost two men in the fight,<ref name=\"autogenerated8\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171</ref> which may have involved up to a thousand men.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 258</ref> Meanwhile, Devon continued his attempts to persuade the city of Exeter to raise a force on his behalf \u2013 which they refused to do \u2013 before leaving Exeter on 15 December,<ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/> as Bonville approached, on his way to Powderham. The two forces met at Clyst, just south west of Exeter.<ref>Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 260</ref>\n\n==The fight at Clyst==\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]\nDevon marched from Exeter to encounter Bonville at [[Clyst Heath]]; there are very few extant sources for the event, and only one chronicler provides any details, saying he \"departed out of the city with his people into the field of Clyst, and there bickered and fought with the Lord Bonville and put them to flight, and so returned again that night into the city.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated9\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171\u20132</ref> Many bones were discovered when the site was excavated in 1800, although some, Storey points out, must belong to those killed in the [[Prayer Book Rebellion#Clyst Heath massaacre | 1549 engagement on the same site]].

This was still under the control of Bonville's allies, York, Salisbury, and Warwick, but had up until that point the Yorkists had failed to intervene in this local feud. The feud has been described as an example of local activities influencing parliament itself,<ref>Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 59</ref> and Griffiths said it was used as \"a pretext for demanding York's appointment as protector.\"<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 755</ref> When parliament reassembled on 12 November it was presented with reports that Devon was leading an army of about 4,000 men and including 400 cavalry to London. The king was still incapacitated. Unable to manage the situation; the Duke of York used the immediate necessity for intervention as a mechanism for being formally appointed Protector. He did not immediately hasten to the south west to punish the Earl of Devon, though. The earl was merely dismissed from his role on the [[Justice of the peace|commission of the peace]] in early December.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172\u20133</ref> Soon after, the local gentry were ordered to be ready to assist York. The duke did not set out until news was received of the Clyst confrontation. One chronicler states that following his defeat, Bonville \"fled, and came to Grenewiche to the kyng, and the kyng sent him agayne to the lord protectour;\"<ref>Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 64</ref> although it is also possible that he was committed to the [[Fleet Prison]] for a short time.<ref>Cherry, M., 'The Crown & Political Society in Devon' (Ph.D thesis, University of Wales (Swansea) 1981), 303</ref> When finally York left for the south west, he summoned the Earl of Devon to [[Shaftesbury]] where the earl was arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]].<ref name=\"autogenerated11\">Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Earl of Devon remained imprisoned for only a few months. It is possible that an attempt was made to bring him to trial in February, but if so, it was probably \u2013 in Storey's words \u2013 \"countermanded.\" This could have been, he suggests, indicative of York's \"waning\" position, as the protectorate was soon to come to an end:<ref name=\"autogenerated11\"/> Cherry has said that the king's resumption of personal power in February 1456 must have come as \"a considerable relief\" to the earl.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\">Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138</ref> He seems to have taken the Yorkists' eclipse as a further opportunity to continue the feud, which provoked governmental admonishment in March, when his son [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John Courtenay]], with 500 armed men, again prevented the Exeter justices of the peace from sitting, and evicted them. [[Letters patent|Commissions]] of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' were issued in August, being led by Bonville's ally the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]].<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173\u20134</ref> Although Bonville presented a long list of offences committed by Devon to the council (whilst mitigating his own involvement), the crown \"was obviously unimpressed\" by this, and eventually not only restored Devon to commission of the peace (12 September 1456) but also pardoned him and his sons for any involvement in the murder of Radford, eventually even appointing him to the lucrative office of keeper of the forest and park of [[Clarendon Park, Wiltshire|Clarendon]].<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> The region subsequently remained quiet; Bonville was of advanced age and Devon was possibly unwell, as he died in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] within eighteen months.<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174</ref> His will was executed by some of the most important men on the Queen's council.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/>\n\nThe region took no active part in the ensuing civil wars until the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471, but both parties to the feud were killed in the civil wars over the next few years. The new [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who had killed Radford, was a thorough supporter of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] regime. After the [[House of York|Yorkist]] victory at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] in June 1460, he took his troops northwards to [[Margaret of Anjou]]<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> in [[York]], where, in April 1461, he was executed by the new king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] after the [[Battle of Towton]]. Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Duke of York]] and the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] was summarily beheaded<ref>Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174\u20135</ref> \u2013 probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.<ref>Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A.
