The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration\u2014mainly from China, Japan, Portugal\u2014especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain\u2014catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nHCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, \"aunty\" and \"uncle\" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of \"it is hot today, isn't it?\", an HCE speaker would say simply \"stay hot, eh?\"{{efn|English \"to be\" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where \"to be\" is used in [[General American]], \"to stay\" is preferred. \"To stay\" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[:en:wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[:en:wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[:en:wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|\u00e6\u0303\u02d0\u02e7\u02e6}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which utilizes \u306d (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[:en:wikt:n\u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e9?]] (shortened from \"[[:en:wikt:n\u00e3o \u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e3o \u00e9?]]\"), cf. French [[:en:wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Religion===\n\n[[File:Perspective view of northwest elevation - Makiki Christian Church, 829 Pensacola Street, Honolulu, Honolulu County, HI HABS HI-533-1 (cropped).tif|thumb|alt=The fa\u00e7ade of a Christian church in downtown Honolulu.|The Makiki Christian Church in Honolulu heavily draws upon [[Japanese architecture]].]]\n\nChristianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii, mainly represented by various [[Protestants]], [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Mormons]].

Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]], Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a \"[[Sunshine tax]]\". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many [[island country|island states and territories]] suffer from as well.\n\nThe higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages. Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living.<ref name=\"Keeping up with the Jones Act\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |website=[[Hawaii Business Magazine]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archivedate=August 23, 2012 |url-status=live|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|title=Jones Act Does Not Bar International Trade From Hawaii|last=Hansen|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Hawai\u02bbi Free Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi|accessdate=July 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728040004/http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.

Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|l\u016b{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}\n[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]\n\nThe [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]], [[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]], and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional l\u016b{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|k\u0101lua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.\n\n===Customs and etiquette===\n\n{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}\n\nSome key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the [[pandanggo]]). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as \"locals of Hawaii\" or \"people of Hawaii\".\n\n===Hawaiian mythology===\n\n{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}\n[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a German museum]]\n\nHawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before ''circa'' 1800.

Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales.

The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration\u2014mainly from China, Japan, Portugal\u2014especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain\u2014catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nHCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, \"aunty\" and \"uncle\" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of \"it is hot today, isn't it?\", an HCE speaker would say simply \"stay hot, eh?\"{{efn|English \"to be\" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where \"to be\" is used in [[General American]], \"to stay\" is preferred. \"To stay\" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[:en:wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[:en:wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[:en:wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|\u00e6\u0303\u02d0\u02e7\u02e6}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which utilizes \u306d (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[:en:wikt:n\u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e9?]] (shortened from \"[[:en:wikt:n\u00e3o \u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e3o \u00e9?]]\"), cf. French [[:en:wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Religion===\n\n[[File:Perspective view of northwest elevation - Makiki Christian Church, 829 Pensacola Street, Honolulu, Honolulu County, HI HABS HI-533-1 (cropped).tif|thumb|alt=The fa\u00e7ade of a Christian church in downtown Honolulu.|The Makiki Christian Church in Honolulu heavily draws upon [[Japanese architecture]].]]\n\nChristianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii, mainly represented by various [[Protestants]], [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Mormons]].

Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]], Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a \"[[Sunshine tax]]\". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many [[island country|island states and territories]] suffer from as well.\n\nThe higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages. Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living.<ref name=\"Keeping up with the Jones Act\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |website=[[Hawaii Business Magazine]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archivedate=August 23, 2012 |url-status=live|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|title=Jones Act Does Not Bar International Trade From Hawaii|last=Hansen|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Hawai\u02bbi Free Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi|accessdate=July 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728040004/http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.

Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|l\u016b{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}\n[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]\n\nThe [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]], [[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]], and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional l\u016b{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|k\u0101lua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.\n\n===Customs and etiquette===\n\n{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}\n\nSome key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the [[pandanggo]]). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as \"locals of Hawaii\" or \"people of Hawaii\".\n\n===Hawaiian mythology===\n\n{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}\n[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a German museum]]\n\nHawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before ''circa'' 1800.

Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales.

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault [[Siege of Nicaea|captured Nicea]] in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Muhammad]] founded the Islamic religion in the 7th{{nbsp}}century leading to the [[Early Muslim conquests|conquest]] by Muslim Arabs of territory that ranged from the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the east, across North Africa and Southern France to the Iberian Peninsula in the West. [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] were taken from the Byzantine Empire. It was political and religious fragmentation that brought this expansion to an end. [[Shia Islam]]{{mdash}}the belief system that only descendants of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, [[Ali]], and daughter, [[Fatimah]], could lawfully be [[caliph]]{{mdash}} emerged leading a [[Shia\u2013Sunni relations|split]] with [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic schools and branches|Islam]] on theology, ritual and law. [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]] became independent in modern Spain and Portugal from the 8th{{nbsp}}century. The Shi'ite [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] dynasty ruled North Africa, swathes of Western Asia including Jerusalem, Damascus and parts of the Mediterranean coastline from 969.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=19\u201320}}. The Muslims rulers did not require total submission to Islam from Jews or Christians because they were considered [[People of the Book]] or [[dhimmi]]. As such they could continue following their faiths on payment of a [[Jizya|poll tax]]. In the Near East a minority Muslim elite ruled over indigenous Christians{{mdash}}Greeks, [[Armenians]], [[Syrians]] and [[Copts]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=18\u201323}}\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims, such as the [[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064\u20131065]], reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=10\u201312}}.</ref> The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders' is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\n===Situation in Europe===\n\nEarly Christians used to the use of violence for communal purposes.  A Christian theology of war inevitably evolved from when [[Roman citizenship]] and Christianity  became linked. Citizens were required to fight against the Empire's enemies. Dating from the works of the 4th-century [[Christian theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] a doctrine of [[holy war]] developed. Augustine wrote that an aggressive war was sinful, but a \"[[Just war theory|just war]]\" could be rationalised if proclaimed by a legitimate authority such as a king or bishop, it was defensive or for the recovery of lands, and a it did not involve excessive violence.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012||pp=14\u201315}} The breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in Western Europe created a warriors caste who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref> Violent acts were commonly used for dispute resolution , and the papacy attempted to mitigate it.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201331}} Historians, such as [[Carl Erdmann]], believed that the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements restricted conflict between Christians from the 10th{{nbsp}}century and the influence of these is apparent in [[Pope Urban II]]'s speeches. But later historians, such as Marcus Bull, assert that the movements' effectiveness were limited and had died out completely by the time of the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\nBy the start of the 11th{{nbsp}}century, the influence of the papacy had declined to that of little more than a localised [[bishopric]]. In the period from around 1050 until 1080 it was the [[Gregorian Reform]] movement that developed increasingly assertive policies, eager to increase its power and influence. This prompted conflict with eastern Christians rooted in the doctrine of [[papal supremacy]]. The Eastern church viewed the pope as only one of the [[Pentarchy|five patriarchs]] of the Church, alongside the Patriarchates of [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. In 1054 differencies in custom, creed and practice spurred [[Pope Leo IX]] to send a legation to the Patriarch of Constantinople, which ended in mutual [[excommunication]] and an [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=24\u201330}}\n\n[[Pope Alexander II]] developed recruitment systems via oaths for military resourcing that [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] further extended across Europe. {{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} These were deployed by the Church in the Christian conflicts with Muslims during in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in [[Norman conquest of Sicily|campaign]] against the [[Emirate of Sicily]]{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=18\u201319, 289}} Gregory&nbsp;VII went further in 1074,  planning a display of military power to reinforce the principle of papal sovereignty in a holy war supporting Byzantium against the Seljuks, but was unable to build support for this.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=16}} Theologian [[Anselm of Lucca]] took the decisive step towards an authentic crusader ideology, stating that fighting for legitimate purposes could result in the remission of [[Christian views on sin|sins]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n[[File:Al_Andalus_&_Christian_Kingdoms.png|thumb|upright=|Islamic rule: Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms {{circa}}&nbsp;1000|alt=Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms circa the year 1000]]On the [[Iberian Peninsula]] there was no significant Christian polity. The Christian realms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] lacked a common identity and shared history based on tribe or ethnicity so they frequently united and divided during the 11th and 12th centuries. Although small, all developed an aristocratic military technique and in 1031 the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain created the opportunity for the territorial gains that later became known as the [[Reconquista]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=183\u2013184}} In 1063 [[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII of Aquitaine]] led a combined force of French, [[Aragon]]ese and [[wikt:Catalans|Catalan]] knights to take the city of [[Crusade of Barbastro|Barbastro]] that had been in Muslim hands since the year 711. This had the full support of [[Pope Alexander II]], a [[Truce of God]] was declared in Catalonia and indulgances were granted to the participants. It was a holy war but differed from the First Crusade as there was no pilgrimage, no vow and no formal authorisation by the church.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=206}} Shortly before the First Crusade, Pope Urban II had encouraged the Iberian Christians to take [[Tarragona]], using much of the same symbolism and rhetoric that was later used to preach the crusade to the people of Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Italo-Normans]] were successful in seizing much of Southern Italy and Sicily from the Byzantines and North African Arabs in the decades before the First Crusade.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}}. This brought them into conflict with the Papacy leading to a campaign against them by [[Pope Leo IX]] who they deteated at [[Battle of Civitate|Civitate]], although when they invaded Muslim Sicily in 1059 they did so under a papal banner: the {{lang|la|lnvexillum sancti Petri}} or banner of St Peter.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=307}} [[Robert Guiscard]] captured the Byzantine city of [[Bari]] in 1071 and campaigned along the Eastern [[Adriatic]] coast around [[Dyrrachium]] in 1081 and 1085. {{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=46}}\n\n===Situation in the East===\n\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Byzantine Empire and locations of key battles with the Seljuks for the control of [[Anatolia]] in the 1070s.|left|alt=Map of the Mediterranean Sea with the extent of the Byzantine Empire highlighted and locations of key battles in the 1070s indicated]]Compared with Western Europe the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world were historic centres of wealth, culture and military power. As such, the west was viewed as a backwater that presented negligable threat.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}} Under [[Basil II]] the territorial recovery of the Empire reached its furthest extent in 1025. The Empire's frontiers stretched east to Iran, Bulgaria was under control as was much of southern Italy and piracy in the Mediterranean Sea had been suppressed. Relations with the Empire's Islamic neighbours were no more quarrelsome than relations with the [[Slavs]] or Western Christians. [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in Italy; [[Pechenegs]], [[Serbs]] and [[Cumans]] to the north; and Seljuk Turks in the east were all in competition with the Empire and to meet these challenges the emperors recruited [[mercenary|mercenaries]], even on occasions from their enemies.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}}\n \nThe first waves of [[Turkic migration]] into the Middle East enjoined Arab and Turkic history from the 9th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Holt|2004|pp=6\u20137}} The status quo in Western Asia was challenged by later waves of Turkish migration, particularly the arrival of the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks in the 10th{{nbsp}}century. These were a minor ruling clan from Transoxania. They converted to Islam and migrated into Iran to seek their fortune. In the following two decades they conquered Iran, Iraq and the Near East. The Seljuks and their followers were [[Sunni|Sunni Msulims]] which led to conflict in Palestine and Syria with the Shi'ite Fatimids.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=39\u201341}} The Seljuks nomads, Turkish speaking and occasionally shamanistic. Behaviours that were very different from those of their sedentary, Arabic speaking subjects. This was a difference that weakened power structures when combined with the Seljuks habitual governance of territory based on political preferment and competition between independent princes rather than geography.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=43\u201344}} Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] attempted to suppress the Seljuks sporadic raiding in 1071 but was defeated at the [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]]. Historians once considered this a pivotal event, but the battle is now considered as only one further step in the expansion of the [[Great Seljuk Empire]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}}\n\nFrom 1092 the status quo in the Middle East disintegrated following the death of the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This was closely followed by the deaths of the Seljuk Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]]. The Islamic historian [[Carole Hillenbrand]] has described this as analogous to the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 with the phrase \"familiar political entities gave way to disorientation and disunity\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=33}} The confusion and division meant the Islamic world disregarded the world beyond; this made it vulnerable to, and surprised by, the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=41}} Malik-Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum]] by [[Kilij Arslan I]], and in Syria by his brother [[Tutush I]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, it has been argued that Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=8}}.</ref> According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of ''[[Deus vult]]!'' (\"God wills it!\").<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=65}}.</ref>\n\n==People's Crusade==\n\n{{Main|People's Crusade}}\n\n[[File:Carte de la premiere croisade.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A map of the routes of the major leaders of the crusade, in [[French language|French]]|alt=A map of the Mediterranean, with the routes of Hugh I of Vermandois, Godfrey of Bouillon, Bohemond of Taranto, Raymond IV of Toulouse, Robert Curthose, and Baldwin of Boulogne highlighted.

Major battles in Asia Minor are marked.]]The great French nobles and their trained armies of knights, however, were not the first to undertake the journey towards Jerusalem. Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:PeoplesCrusadeMassacre.jpg|200px|left|thumb|An illustration showing the defeat of the [[People's Crusade]], from S\u00e9bastien Mamerot's ''Livre des Passages d'Outre-mer'' ([[Jean Colombe]], c. 1472\u201375, [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale|BNF]] Fr. 5594)|alt=Lines of peasants and armies are shown in battle against the Seljuq Turks.]]Lacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref>\n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch. The soldiers on the ground, armed for battle, are stopping and watching Bohemond.]]\n\nThe crusader army, meanwhile, marched on to [[Antioch]], which lay about halfway between Constantinople and Jerusalem. Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dieing of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders.

He expelled all of Jerusalem's Christian inhabitants, to avoid the possibility of the city falling due to treason from the inside, and he poisoned most of the wells in the area and Christians were expelled from Jerusalem before the Crusaders' arrival.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=33}} The crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before, on 7 June. Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=153\u2013157}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Jerusalem===\n{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)}}\n\nCrusaders' arrival at Jerusalem revealed an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious ecclesiastical candidate to establish an religious lordship, as a body of opinion maintained. Although Raymond of Toulouse could claim to be the  pre-eminent crusade leader from 1098 his support had waned since his failed attempts to beseige [[Arqa]] and create his own realm. This may have been why he piously refused the crown on the grounds that it could only be worn by Christ. It may also have been an attempt to persuade others to reject the title, however Godfrey was already familiar with such a position and more persuasive was probably the large army of troops from Lorraine in Jerusalem, led by him and his brothers, [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]], who were vassals of the [[House of Ardenne-Verdun|Ardennes-Bouillion dynasty]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=62}} Therefore Godfrey was elected, accepting the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=103}}\n\n===Battle of Ascalon===\n{{Main|Battle of Ascalon}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Ascalon-engraving.jpg|210px|thumb|An engraving of the [[Battle of Ascalon]] by C.W.

Geoffrey and Raymond marched out to meet this force on 9 August to prevent being besieged with a force of only 1,200 knights and 9,000 foot soldiers. Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond. The city remained in Muslim hands and a military threat to the nascent kingdom.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[crusader states]] after the First Crusade]]\n{{see|Crusader states|Kingdom of Jerusalem|Knights Hospitaller|Knights Templar| Crusade of 1101|Second Crusade}}\n\nThe majority of crusaders now considered their pilgrimage complete and returned home. Only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry remained to defend [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It was the support of the knights from Lorraine that enabled Godfrey to take secular leadership of Jerusalem, over the claims of Raymond. When he dies a year later these same Lorrainers thwarted the [[papal legate]], [[Dagobert of Pisa]]'s plans for Jerusalem becoming a [[theocracy]] and instead made Baldwin the first Latin [[List of kings of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=116}} Bohemond returned to Europe to fight the Byzantines from Italy but he was defeated in 1108 at [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)|Dyrrhachium]]. After Raymond's death, his heirs captured [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] with the Genoese support. {{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=142\u2013149}} Relations between the newly created Crusader states of the county of Edessa and the principality of Antioch were variable: they fought together in the crusader defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]]; but the Antiocheans claimed suzerainty and blocked the return of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] after his capture at the battle.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=70}} The Franks became fully engaged in Near East politics with the result that Muslims and Christians often fought on opposing sides. The expansion of Antioch's territorial expansion ended in 1119 with the major defeat to the Turks at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n[[File:Crusade of 1101 v1.svg|200px|thumb|left|A map of western Anatolia showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101|alt=A map of western Anatolia, showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101]] However, there were many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When the success of the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=35}}</ref> Back at home in Western Europe, those who had survived to reach Jerusalem were treated as heroes. Robert of Flanders was nicknamed \"Hierosolymitanus\" (Robert ''of Jerusalem'') thanks to his exploits.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierosolymitanus Wiktionary: hierosolymitanus]</ref> Among the crusaders in the [[Crusade of 1101]] were [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]], both of whom had returned home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Seljuqs]], but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Lock142\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=142\u2013144}}</ref>.\n\nThere is limited written evidence of the Islamic reaction dating fromm before 1160, but what there is indicates the crusade was barely noticed. This may be the result of a cultural misunderstanding in that the Turks and Arabs did not recognise the crusaders as the religiously motivated warriors they with motivations of conquest and settlement. The assumption was the crusaders were just the latest in a long line of Byzantine mercenaries. Also the Islamic world remained divided between rival rulers in [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]]. There was no pan-Islamic counter-attack giving the crusaders the opportunity to consolidate.\n\n==Historiography==\n\n{{see|Historiography of the Crusades}}\n\nLatin Christedom was amazed by the success of the First Crusade for which they onlt credible explanation was it was the work of God. If the crusade had failed it is likely that the paradigm of crusading would have become [[Obsolescence|Obsolete]]. Instead this form of religious warfare was popular for centuries and the crusade itself became one of the most written about historic event of the medieval period. One of the most influential and earliest works was the anonymous {{lang|la|Gesta Francorum}} or ''Deeds of the Franks''. It was probably written by an Italo-Norman noble in Jerusalem from 1100. It was a new type of epic and heroic narrative, rather than chronicle, history callen a {{lang|la|historia}}. [[Raymond of Aquilers]], [[Fulcher of Chartres]] and [[Peter Tudebode]] used this as a template for their own versions.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nThese sources were in turn rewritten by three Benedictine northern French monks; [[Robert of Rheims]], [[Guibert of Nogent]] and [[Baldric of Bourgueil]]. Not only did they polish the language used, they also added their own events. Robert's additions included Biblical references, miraculous events and expanded the part played by Pope Urban to the point where he instigated, directed and legitimised towards the objective that was always Jerusalem. The popularity of these works shaped how crusading was viewed in the medieval mind and Robert's work was the source of the 10,000 line {{lang|fr|[[chanson de geste]]}}, epic poem, about the crusade called {{lang|fr|[[Chanson d'Antioche]]}}. The crusades in memory were shaped by these works; with Godfrey as the primary leader, the miracles of the [[Holy Lance]] and revelling in the violent sack of Jersualem.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=109\u2013111}}\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nHistorians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref> [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}</ref> [[Thomas F. Madden]] argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref> [[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref> In the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref> [[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan further argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|First Crusade}}\n* [[Christian Forces of the First Crusades]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Godfrey of Bouillon]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Hugh the Great]]\n** [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|The Crusader Army of Robert Curthose]]\n* [[Second Crusade]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. |isbn=978-1-78093-767-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92914-8|ref=harv}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Holt|first=Peter Malcolm|authorlink=Peter Holt (historian)|title=The Crusader States and Their Neighbours, 1098-1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qLHVGgH7AC&pg=PA8|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=978-0-582-36931-3}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault [[Siege of Nicaea|captured Nicea]] in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Muhammad]] founded the Islamic religion in the 7th{{nbsp}}century leading to the [[Early Muslim conquests|conquest]] by Muslim Arabs of territory that ranged from the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the east, across North Africa and Southern France to the Iberian Peninsula in the West. [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] were taken from the Byzantine Empire. It was political and religious fragmentation that brought this expansion to an end. [[Shia Islam]]{{mdash}}the belief system that only descendants of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, [[Ali]], and daughter, [[Fatimah]], could lawfully be [[caliph]]{{mdash}} emerged leading a [[Shia\u2013Sunni relations|split]] with [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic schools and branches|Islam]] on theology, ritual and law. [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]] became independent in modern Spain and Portugal from the 8th{{nbsp}}century. The Shi'ite [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] dynasty ruled North Africa, swathes of Western Asia including Jerusalem, Damascus and parts of the Mediterranean coastline from 969.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=19\u201320}}. The Muslims rulers did not require total submission to Islam from Jews or Christians because they were considered [[People of the Book]] or [[dhimmi]]. As such they could continue following their faiths on payment of a [[Jizya|poll tax]]. In the Near East a minority Muslim elite ruled over indigenous Christians{{mdash}}Greeks, [[Armenians]], [[Syrians]] and [[Copts]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=18\u201323}}\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims, such as the [[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064\u20131065]], reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=10\u201312}}.</ref> The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders' is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\n===Situation in Europe===\n\nEarly Christians used to the use of violence for communal purposes.  A Christian theology of war inevitably evolved from when [[Roman citizenship]] and Christianity  became linked. Citizens were required to fight against the Empire's enemies. Dating from the works of the 4th-century [[Christian theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] a doctrine of [[holy war]] developed. Augustine wrote that an aggressive war was sinful, but a \"[[Just war theory|just war]]\" could be rationalised if proclaimed by a legitimate authority such as a king or bishop, it was defensive or for the recovery of lands, and a it did not involve excessive violence.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012||pp=14\u201315}} The breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in Western Europe created a warriors caste who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref> Violent acts were commonly used for dispute resolution , and the papacy attempted to mitigate it.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201331}} Historians, such as [[Carl Erdmann]], believed that the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements restricted conflict between Christians from the 10th{{nbsp}}century and the influence of these is apparent in [[Pope Urban II]]'s speeches. But later historians, such as Marcus Bull, assert that the movements' effectiveness were limited and had died out completely by the time of the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\nBy the start of the 11th{{nbsp}}century, the influence of the papacy had declined to that of little more than a localised [[bishopric]]. In the period from around 1050 until 1080 it was the [[Gregorian Reform]] movement that developed increasingly assertive policies, eager to increase its power and influence. This prompted conflict with eastern Christians rooted in the doctrine of [[papal supremacy]]. The Eastern church viewed the pope as only one of the [[Pentarchy|five patriarchs]] of the Church, alongside the Patriarchates of [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. In 1054 differencies in custom, creed and practice spurred [[Pope Leo IX]] to send a legation to the Patriarch of Constantinople, which ended in mutual [[excommunication]] and an [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=24\u201330}}\n\n[[Pope Alexander II]] developed recruitment systems via oaths for military resourcing that [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] further extended across Europe. {{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} These were deployed by the Church in the Christian conflicts with Muslims during in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in [[Norman conquest of Sicily|campaign]] against the [[Emirate of Sicily]]{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=18\u201319, 289}} Gregory&nbsp;VII went further in 1074,  planning a display of military power to reinforce the principle of papal sovereignty in a holy war supporting Byzantium against the Seljuks, but was unable to build support for this.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=16}} Theologian [[Anselm of Lucca]] took the decisive step towards an authentic crusader ideology, stating that fighting for legitimate purposes could result in the remission of [[Christian views on sin|sins]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n[[File:Al_Andalus_&_Christian_Kingdoms.png|thumb|upright=|Islamic rule: Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms {{circa}}&nbsp;1000|alt=Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms circa the year 1000]]On the [[Iberian Peninsula]] there was no significant Christian polity. The Christian realms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] lacked a common identity and shared history based on tribe or ethnicity so they frequently united and divided during the 11th and 12th centuries. Although small, all developed an aristocratic military technique and in 1031 the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain created the opportunity for the territorial gains that later became known as the [[Reconquista]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=183\u2013184}} In 1063 [[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII of Aquitaine]] led a combined force of French, [[Aragon]]ese and [[wikt:Catalans|Catalan]] knights to take the city of [[Crusade of Barbastro|Barbastro]] that had been in Muslim hands since the year 711. This had the full support of [[Pope Alexander II]], a [[Truce of God]] was declared in Catalonia and indulgances were granted to the participants. It was a holy war but differed from the First Crusade as there was no pilgrimage, no vow and no formal authorisation by the church.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=206}} Shortly before the First Crusade, Pope Urban II had encouraged the Iberian Christians to take [[Tarragona]], using much of the same symbolism and rhetoric that was later used to preach the crusade to the people of Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Italo-Normans]] were successful in seizing much of Southern Italy and Sicily from the Byzantines and North African Arabs in the decades before the First Crusade.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}}. This brought them into conflict with the Papacy leading to a campaign against them by [[Pope Leo IX]] who they deteated at [[Battle of Civitate|Civitate]], although when they invaded Muslim Sicily in 1059 they did so under a papal banner: the {{lang|la|lnvexillum sancti Petri}} or banner of St Peter.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=307}} [[Robert Guiscard]] captured the Byzantine city of [[Bari]] in 1071 and campaigned along the Eastern [[Adriatic]] coast around [[Dyrrachium]] in 1081 and 1085. {{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=46}}\n\n===Situation in the East===\n\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Byzantine Empire and locations of key battles with the Seljuks for the control of [[Anatolia]] in the 1070s.|left|alt=Map of the Mediterranean Sea with the extent of the Byzantine Empire highlighted and locations of key battles in the 1070s indicated]]Compared with Western Europe the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world were historic centres of wealth, culture and military power. As such, the west was viewed as a backwater that presented negligable threat.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}} Under [[Basil II]] the territorial recovery of the Empire reached its furthest extent in 1025. The Empire's frontiers stretched east to Iran, Bulgaria was under control as was much of southern Italy and piracy in the Mediterranean Sea had been suppressed. Relations with the Empire's Islamic neighbours were no more quarrelsome than relations with the [[Slavs]] or Western Christians. [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in Italy; [[Pechenegs]], [[Serbs]] and [[Cumans]] to the north; and Seljuk Turks in the east were all in competition with the Empire and to meet these challenges the emperors recruited [[mercenary|mercenaries]], even on occasions from their enemies.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}}\n \nThe first waves of [[Turkic migration]] into the Middle East enjoined Arab and Turkic history from the 9th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Holt|2004|pp=6\u20137}} The status quo in Western Asia was challenged by later waves of Turkish migration, particularly the arrival of the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks in the 10th{{nbsp}}century. These were a minor ruling clan from Transoxania. They converted to Islam and migrated into Iran to seek their fortune. In the following two decades they conquered Iran, Iraq and the Near East. The Seljuks and their followers were [[Sunni|Sunni Msulims]] which led to conflict in Palestine and Syria with the Shi'ite Fatimids.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=39\u201341}} The Seljuks nomads, Turkish speaking and occasionally shamanistic. Behaviours that were very different from those of their sedentary, Arabic speaking subjects. This was a difference that weakened power structures when combined with the Seljuks habitual governance of territory based on political preferment and competition between independent princes rather than geography.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=43\u201344}} Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] attempted to suppress the Seljuks sporadic raiding in 1071 but was defeated at the [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]]. Historians once considered this a pivotal event, but the battle is now considered as only one further step in the expansion of the [[Great Seljuk Empire]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}}\n\nFrom 1092 the status quo in the Middle East disintegrated following the death of the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This was closely followed by the deaths of the Seljuk Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]]. The Islamic historian [[Carole Hillenbrand]] has described this as analogous to the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 with the phrase \"familiar political entities gave way to disorientation and disunity\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=33}} The confusion and division meant the Islamic world disregarded the world beyond; this made it vulnerable to, and surprised by, the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=41}} Malik-Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum]] by [[Kilij Arslan I]], and in Syria by his brother [[Tutush I]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal.

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\nLacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref>\n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch. The soldiers on the ground, armed for battle, are stopping and watching Bohemond.]]\n\nThe crusader army, meanwhile, marched on to [[Antioch]], which lay about halfway between Constantinople and Jerusalem. Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dieing of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders. Finally, at the beginning of 1099, the march restarted, leaving Bohemond behind as the first Prince of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\n===Continued march to Jerusalem===\n{{main|First Crusade: March down the Mediterranean coast}}\n[[File:Byzantium after the First crusade.PNG|thumb|300px|Route of the First Crusade through Asia]]\n\nProceeding down the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, the crusaders encountered little resistance, as local rulers preferred to make peace with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception of the abandoned [[siege of Arqa]].<ref name=\"Tyerman150\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=150}}.</ref>\n\n[[Iftikhar ad-Daula]], the Fatimid governor of Jerusalem, was aware of the arrival of the Crusaders.  He expelled all of Jerusalem's Christian inhabitants, to avoid the possibility of the city falling due to treason from the inside, and he poisoned most of the wells in the area and Christians were expelled from Jerusalem before the Crusaders' arrival.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=33}} The crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before, on 7 June. Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=153\u2013157}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Jerusalem===\n{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)}}\n\nCrusaders' arrival at Jerusalem revealed an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege.

Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious ecclesiastical candidate to establish an religious lordship, as a body of opinion maintained. Although Raymond of Toulouse could claim to be the  pre-eminent crusade leader from 1098 his support had waned since his failed attempts to beseige [[Arqa]] and create his own realm. This may have been why he piously refused the crown on the grounds that it could only be worn by Christ. It may also have been an attempt to persuade others to reject the title, however Godfrey was already familiar with such a position and more persuasive was probably the large army of troops from Lorraine in Jerusalem, led by him and his brothers, [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]], who were vassals of the [[House of Ardenne-Verdun|Ardennes-Bouillion dynasty]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=62}} Therefore Godfrey was elected, accepting the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=103}}\n\n===Battle of Ascalon===\n{{Main|Battle of Ascalon}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Ascalon-engraving.jpg|210px|thumb|An engraving of the [[Battle of Ascalon]] by C.W.

Geoffrey and Raymond marched out to meet this force on 9 August to prevent being besieged with a force of only 1,200 knights and 9,000 foot soldiers. Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond. The city remained in Muslim hands and a military threat to the nascent kingdom.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[crusader states]] after the First Crusade]]\n{{see|Crusader states|Kingdom of Jerusalem|Knights Hospitaller|Knights Templar| Crusade of 1101|Second Crusade}}\n\nThe majority of crusaders now considered their pilgrimage complete and returned home. Only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry remained to defend [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It was the support of the knights from Lorraine that enabled Godfrey to take secular leadership of Jerusalem, over the claims of Raymond. When he dies a year later these same Lorrainers thwarted the [[papal legate]], [[Dagobert of Pisa]]'s plans for Jerusalem becoming a [[theocracy]] and instead made Baldwin the first Latin [[List of kings of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=116}} Bohemond returned to Europe to fight the Byzantines from Italy but he was defeated in 1108 at [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)|Dyrrhachium]]. After Raymond's death, his heirs captured [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] with the Genoese support. {{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=142\u2013149}} Relations between the newly created Crusader states of the county of Edessa and the principality of Antioch were variable: they fought together in the crusader defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]]; but the Antiocheans claimed suzerainty and blocked the return of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] after his capture at the battle.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=70}} The Franks became fully engaged in Near East politics with the result that Muslims and Christians often fought on opposing sides. The expansion of Antioch's territorial expansion ended in 1119 with the major defeat to the Turks at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Field of Blood]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n[[File:Crusade of 1101 v1.svg|200px|thumb|left|A map of western Anatolia showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101|alt=A map of western Anatolia, showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the crusade of 1101]] However, there were many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When the success of the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=35}}</ref> Back at home in Western Europe, those who had survived to reach Jerusalem were treated as heroes. Robert of Flanders was nicknamed \"Hierosolymitanus\" (Robert ''of Jerusalem'') thanks to his exploits.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierosolymitanus Wiktionary: hierosolymitanus]</ref> Among the crusaders in the [[Crusade of 1101]] were [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]], both of whom had returned home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Seljuqs]], but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Lock142\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=142\u2013144}}</ref>.\n\nThere is limited written evidence of the Islamic reaction dating fromm before 1160, but what there is indicates the crusade was barely noticed. This may be the result of a cultural misunderstanding in that the Turks and Arabs did not recognise the crusaders as the religiously motivated warriors they with motivations of conquest and settlement. The assumption was the crusaders were just the latest in a long line of Byzantine mercenaries. Also the Islamic world remained divided between rival rulers in [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]]. There was no pan-Islamic counter-attack giving the crusaders the opportunity to consolidate.\n\n==Historiography==\n\n{{see|Historiography of the Crusades}}\n\nLatin Christedom was amazed by the success of the First Crusade for which they onlt credible explanation was it was the work of God. If the crusade had failed it is likely that the paradigm of crusading would have become [[Obsolescence|Obsolete]]. Instead this form of religious warfare was popular for centuries and the crusade itself became one of the most written about historic event of the medieval period. One of the most influential and earliest works was the anonymous {{lang|la|Gesta Francorum}} or ''Deeds of the Franks''. It was probably written by an Italo-Norman noble in Jerusalem from 1100. It was a new type of epic and heroic narrative, rather than chronicle, history callen a {{lang|la|historia}}. [[Raymond of Aquilers]], [[Fulcher of Chartres]] and [[Peter Tudebode]] used this as a template for their own versions.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nThese sources were in turn rewritten by three Benedictine northern French monks; [[Robert of Rheims]], [[Guibert of Nogent]] and [[Baldric of Bourgueil]]. Not only did they polish the language used, they also added their own events. Robert's additions included Biblical references, miraculous events and expanded the part played by Pope Urban to the point where he instigated, directed and legitimised towards the objective that was always Jerusalem. The popularity of these works shaped how crusading was viewed in the medieval mind and Robert's work was the source of the 10,000 line {{lang|fr|[[chanson de geste]]}}, epic poem, about the crusade called {{lang|fr|[[Chanson d'Antioche]]}}. The crusades in memory were shaped by these works; with Godfrey as the primary leader, the miracles of the [[Holy Lance]] and revelling in the violent sack of Jersualem.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=109\u2013111}}\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nHistorians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref> [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}</ref> [[Thomas F. Madden]] argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref> [[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref> In the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref> [[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan further argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|First Crusade}}\n* [[Christian Forces of the First Crusades]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Godfrey of Bouillon]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Hugh the Great]]\n** [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|The Crusader Army of Robert Curthose]]\n* [[Second Crusade]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. |isbn=978-1-78093-767-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92914-8|ref=harv}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Holt|first=Peter Malcolm|authorlink=Peter Holt (historian)|title=The Crusader States and Their Neighbours, 1098-1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qLHVGgH7AC&pg=PA8|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=978-0-582-36931-3}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.

An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments. Those employed by non-profit (or not-for profit in Canada) organizations are in charge of organizing fund-raising events and enlisting financial supporters. Additionally, arts administrators are expected to conduct grant research, apply for grants and disburse acquired funding so that programming can continue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Arts_Administrator_Job_Description_Duties_and_Career_Outlook.html|title=Arts Administrator: Job Description, Duties and Career Outlook|last=|first=|date=|website=study.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn arts administrator employed by a small organization can be responsible for [[marketing|marketing events]], event booking, and managing project budges.

Focal Press. p. 84.</ref> External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 87.</ref>  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 93.</ref> Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times. Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues. As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.\n\n== Government Funding and Granting Bodies ==\nEach country has their own models and agencies to fund the arts. In Canada the arts are funded by the Canadian government through the Department of Canadian Heritage. Each province has a ministry that funds arts and culture. Depending on the governmental party in power, the amount of funds available for the arts and culture vary. In Ontario, the Ministry that funds the arts is the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-heritage-sport-tourism-culture-industries|title=Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Cultural Industries|last=|first=|date=|website=Ontario.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> \n\nIn Canada there are federal, provincial and municipal granting bodies that fund the arts.

Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.

At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations.

An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments.

Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\".

[http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual & performing arts centers.\n\nMost programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency. The [http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program University of Kentucky], and [http://www3.kutztown.edu/arteducation/artsadministration-program-overview.html Kutztown University of Pennsylvania] offer fully online degrees in arts administration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program|title=Online M.A. Program {{!}} College of Fine Arts|website=finearts.uky.edu|accessdate=2015-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/arts-administration|title=Arts administration|website=SCAD|accessdate=2015-04-06}}</ref>  In order to accommodate full-time employment, provide strong networking opportunities, and many teamwork opportunities, programs such as [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University] have adopted a cohort model and offer classes on evenings and weekends.\n\nSome programs offer dual degrees.  For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.<ref>[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.\n\nOther programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.\n\nSome programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs. Another example is the University of Southern California's [https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/ Master of Science in Arts Leadership] which is housed within the [[USC Thornton School of Music]], and accepts thought leaders in any artistic discipline including music, theatre, dance, film, and fine art.\n\nSeveral universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management. New York University's MA in Arts Administration program allows students to choose a visual arts or a performing arts focus.\n\nIncreasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues.  As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.\n\nArts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.<ref>Gates, Leslie. \u201cProfessional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago.\u201d Vol. 52, no. 1, 2010, pp. 6\u201317., {{jstor|25746078}} Accessed 16 Sept. 2018.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.artsmanagement.net Arts Management Network] International information service for arts administration.\n*[http://www.artsadministration.org Association of Arts Administration Educators] An international association of degree-granting programs in arts and cultural management.\n*[http://www.encatc.org European Network of Cultural Administration Training Centres]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arts Administration}}\n[[Category:Academic disciplines]]\n[[Category:Arts administrators| ]]\n[[Category:Arts occupations]]\n[[Category:Management occupations]]\n[[Category:Occupations in music]]\n", "name_user": "BlurCollective", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moved information from \"Academic Programs\" to other headings where it was more suitable.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_administration"}

Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam!

The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'', and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J.

with the naming convention of the already established [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"DCMarvelForbes\"/><ref name=\"DCCUYahoo\"/><ref name=\"DCCU-EW\"/> Keith Staskiewicz, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', coined the term \"DC Extended Universe\u2122\" as a joke in an article of his about ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' on July 1, 2015.<ref name=\"DCEU-EW\"/><ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years.<ref name=\"TheyAreLegend\"/><ref name=\"BvSEmpireCover\"/> According to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term is not used internally and they do not consider it official.<ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> In 2016, as part of ''DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League'', both Geoff Johns and [[Kevin Smith]] referred to the franchise's name as being the \"Justice League Universe\".<ref name=\"JLU-SR\"/> During the [[DC Films]] panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018, a video banner displayed the words \"Welcome to the Worlds of DC\", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the \"Worlds of DC\".<ref name=\"WoDC-SR\"/><ref name=\"WoDCForbes\"/> Despite this, there has been no official announcement from Warner Bros. nor DC Films to confirm this.}} is an unofficial term used to refer to an American [[media franchise]] and [[shared universe]] that is centered on a [[film series|series]] of [[superhero film]]s, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'' and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J. J. Abrams]] submitted another draft for ''Superman: Flyby''.<ref name=\"DevelopmentHell\"/><ref name=\"BalePetersenMTV\"/> In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and [[Kieran Mulroney]] to write a script for a ''[[Justice League]]'' film.<ref name=\"JusticeVariety2007\"/> [[Christian Bale]], who starred as Batman in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), was not approached to reprise the role,<ref name=\"BaleJusticeLeague\"/> nor was [[Brandon Routh]], who starred as Superman in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"RouthJusticeLeague\"/> [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was hired to direct the film,<ref name=\"MillerVariety\"/> reportedly titled ''Justice League Mortal'',<ref name=\"JLMortalVariety\"/> with [[Armie Hammer]] cast as Batman, [[D. J. Cotrona]] as Superman, [[Adam Brody]] as Flash, [[Santiago Cabrera]] as Aquaman, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Green Lantern, [[Megan Gale]] as Wonder Woman, [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jay Baruchel]] as [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref name=\"GaleWonderWoman\"/> The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure [[tax breaks]] for filming in Australia, as well as the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]] preventing progress on the script.<ref name=\"JusticeLeagueCancelled\"/>\n\nIn 2013, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' franchise]], ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films.<ref name=\"ManOfSteelEW\"/> The film contained references to other characters in the [[DC Universe]], so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe.<ref name=\"MoSBleedingCool\"/><ref name=\"ManofSteelSR\"/> Days before ''Man of Steel''{{'}}s release in June, it was reported that director [[Zack Snyder]] and screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.<ref name=\"GoyerMoSSequel\"/> In July, at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, establishing the shared universe.<ref name=\"LATimesCC2013\"/><ref name=\"EWCC2013\"/> In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.<ref name=\"2014Slate\"/>\n\n[[File:Geoff Johns by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Geoff Johns has served in various positions in DC Films and the DCEU.]]\nWhile the rival [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) includes television productions, DC's crossover series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other.

Modern-day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the educational curriculum additionally includes significant training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease, in most of the countries of the world, where the profession is established and regulated.\n\n'''Optometrists''' (also known as '''doctors of optometry''' in the United States and Canada, by a higher degree in the United Kingdom and worldwide for those holding the O.D. degree) are health care professionals who provide primary eye care through refractions and comprehensive [[eye examination]]s to detect and treat various vision abnormalities and eye diseases. Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location. Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry (i.e. those requiring certain surgical interventions) are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] who are physicians that specialize in the medical and surgical care of the eye. Optometrists typically work closely together with other [[eye care professional]]s such as ophthalmologists and [[optician]]s to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe term \"optometry\" comes from the Greek words ''[[wikt:\u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2]]'' (''opsis''; \"view\") and ''[[wikt:\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]]'' (''metron''; \"something used to measure\", \"measure\", \"rule\"). The word entered the language when the instrument for measuring vision was called an [[Optometer (ophthalmic instrument)|optometer]], (before the terms [[phoropter]] or refractor were used). The root word ''opto'' is a shortened form derived from the Greek word ''ophthalmos'' meaning, \"eye.\" Like most healthcare professions, the education and certification of optometrists are regulated in most countries. Optometric professionals and optometry-related organizations interact with governmental agencies, other healthcare professionals, and the community to deliver eye and vision care.\n\n==Definition of optometry and optometrist==\n[[File: Optometrista.jpeg|thumbnail|An optometrist examining the eyes of a patient with a [[slit lamp]] biomicroscope]]\nThe [[World Council of Optometry]],  [[World Health Organization]] and about 75 optometry organisations from over 40 countries have all over the world adopted the following definition, to be used to describe optometry and optometrist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/our_members/index.cfm/page/1/|title=Case study|first=Pixl8|last=Developer|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202015502/http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/our_members/index.cfm/page/1/|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{block quote|Optometry is a healthcare profession that is autonomous, educated, and regulated (licensed/registered), and optometrists are the primary healthcare practitioners of the eye and visual system who provide comprehensive eye and vision care, which includes refraction and dispensing, detection/diagnosis and management of disease in the eye, and the rehabilitation of conditions of the visual system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/about-wco/who-is-an-optometrist/|title=Who is an optometrist?|first=Laura|last=Prieto|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\n==History==\n[[File: Page 423 from William Porterfield, A treatise on the eye (1759).jpg|thumbnail|Page 423 from \"A treatise on the eye, the manner and phaenomena of vision\" by William Porterfield, Published 1759 in Edinburgh.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[scientist]] and [[historian]] [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]], in his ''Science and Civilization in China'', reported the earliest mention of spectacles was in Venetian guild regulations circa 1300. \nHe suggested that the occasional claim that spectacles were invented in China may have come from a paper by Laufer.  Per Needham, the paper by Laufer had many inconsistencies, and that the references in the document used by Laufer were not in the original copies but added during the Ming dynasty.  Early Chinese sources mention the eyeglasses were imported.<ref>[[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]].

Today, optometry courses are well received by citizens. More universities and higher education studies are about to implement the courses, e.g., [[National Institute of Ophthalmic Sciences]] in [[Petaling Jaya]] whereby it is the academic arm of [[The Tun Hussein Onn National Eye Hospital]]. Other public universities that provide this course are University Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). There is also a private university that provides this course such as Management and Science University (MSU) and SeGi University.\nAfter completing the study in Degree in Optometry, the optometrist who practices in Malaysia  must register under Malaysian Optical Council (MOC) which is the organisation under the Ministry of Health\n\n====Pakistan====\nOptometry is taught as a five/four-year Doctor/ Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors course at many institutions notable among which are Department of Optometry & Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore, Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology (PICO) Peshawar, College of Ophthalmology & Allied Vision Sciences (COAVS) Lahore and Al-Shifa Institute of Ophthalmology Islamabad. After graduation, the optometrists can join a four-tiered service delivery level (Centre of Excellence, Tertiary/Teaching, District headquarter and sub-district /Tehsil headquarters). M.Phil in Optometry is also available at select institutions such as King Edward Medical University, Lahore\nDepartment of Optometry & Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore started bridging programmes for Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors to become Doctor of Optometry OD, Post Professional Doctor of Optometry(PP-OD), Transitional Doctor of Optometry(t-OD).\nOptometry is not yet a regulated field in Pakistan as there is no professional licensing board or authority responsible for issuing practise licenses to qualified optometrists. This creates difficulty for Pakistani optometrists who wish to register abroad.\nThe University of Lahore has recently launched Doctor of optometry (OD).\nImam Hussain Medical University also has launched Doctor of Optometry Program. Chairman Imam Hussain Medical University Dr Sabir Hussain Babachan has vowed to regulate OD curriculum according to international standard.\n\n====Philippines====\nOptometry is regulated by the Professional Regulation Commission of the Philippines. To be eligible for licensing, each candidate must have satisfactorily completed a doctor of optometry course at an accredited institution and demonstrate good moral character with no previous record of professional misconduct. Professional organizations of optometry in the Philippines include Optometric Association of the Philippines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philippineoptometry.net/|title=Optometry Update - Optometry News And Updates|publisher=}}</ref> and Integrated Philippine Association of Optometrists, Inc. (IPAO).\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nIn Saudi Arabia, optometrists must complete a five-year doctor of optometry degree from Qassim University and King Saud University also they must complete a two-year residency.\n\n====Singapore====\nTertiary education for optometrists takes 3 years at the following institutions.\n\nSingapore Polytechnic - Diploma in Optometry [[Singapore Polytechnic]]\n\nNgee Ann Polytechnic - Diploma in Optometry [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]]\n\n====Thailand====\nSince late 1990, Thailand has set a goal to provide more than 600 optometrists to meet the minimal public demands and international standards in vision care. There are more than three university degree programs in Thailand. Each program accepts students that have completed grade 12th or the third year in high school (following US education model). These programs offer \"Doctor of Optometry\" degree to graduates from the program that will take six years to complete the courses. Practising optometrists will also be required to pass licensing examination (three parts examinations) that is administrated through a committee under the Ministry of Public Health.\n\nNowadays, the number of practising optometrists in Thailand is still less than one hundred (2015). However, it has projected that the number of practising optometrists in Thailand will greatly increase within the next ten years. In the theoretical scenario, the number of optometrists should be able to meet minimal public demands around 2030 or earlier.\n\n===Europe===\nSince the formation of the [[European Union]], \"there exists a strong movement, headed by the Association of European Schools and Colleges of Optometry (AESCO), to unify the profession by creating a European-wide examination for optometry\" and presumably also standardized practice and education guidelines within EU countries.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamakiotes DS, Thal LS |title=The unification of European optometry: how the profession will change after 1992 |journal=J Am Optom Assoc |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=904\u201313 |date=December 1991 |pmid=1814983 }}</ref> The first examinations of the new European Diploma in Optometry were held in 1998 and this was a landmark event for optometry in continental Europe.<ref>Agarwal, R.

After protests from the department of Optics at Technological Educational Institute of Athens (the only department of Optics in Greece, until 2006), the Government changed the names of the departments to \"Optics and Optometry\" and included lessons in both optics and optometry. Optometrists-Opticians have to complete a 4-year undergraduate honours degree. Then the graduates can be admitted to postgraduate courses in Optometry at universities around the world.\n\nSince 2015, a Master of Science (MSc) course in Optometry is offered by the Technological Educational Institute of Athens.\n\nThe Institute of Vision and Optics (IVO) of the University of Crete focuses on the sciences of vision and is active in the fields of research, training, technology development and provision of medical services. Professor [[Ioannis Pallikaris]] has received numerous awards and recognitions for the Institute's contribution to [[ophthalmology]]. In 1989 he performed the first [[LASIK]] procedure on a [[human eye]].\n\n====Hungary====\nOptometrist education takes 4 years in the medical universities in Hungary, and they will get a Bachelor of Science degree. They work in networks and retail stores and private optics, very few are located in the Health Care care system as [[ophthalmologist]]s as an assistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.optikaimagazin.hu/a-latszeresz-es-az-optometrista-kepzes-aktualis-helyzete-magyarorszagon/|title=A l\u00e1tszer\u00e9sz- \u00e9s az optometrista-k\u00e9pz\u00e9s aktu\u00e1lis helyzete Magyarorsz\u00e1gon - Optikai Magazin Online|date=1 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Ireland====\nThe profession of Optometry has been represented for over a century by the Association of Optometrists, Ireland [AOI]. In [[Ireland]] an optometrist must first complete a four-year degree in optometry at [[Dublin Institute of Technology]]. Following successful completion of the degree, an optometrist must then complete professional qualifying examinations to enter the register of the Opticians Board [Bord na Radharcmhaistoiri]. Optometrists must be registered with the Board to practice in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe A.O.I. runs a comprehensive continuing education and professional development program on behalf of Irish optometrists. The legislation governing optometry was drafted in 1956. Some feel that the legislation restricts optometrists from using their full range of skills, training and equipment for the benefit of the Irish public. The amendment to the Act in 2003 addressed one of the most significant restrictions: the use of [[cycloplegic]] drugs to examine children.\n\n====Italy====\nIn Italy Optometry is an unregulated profession. It is taught at seven universities: Padua, Turin, Milan, [[University of Salento|Salento]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienzemfn.unisalento.it/cdl_ottica_optometria|title=Facolta di Scienze MM.FF.NN. :: Corso di Laurea in Ottica ed Optometria - Universit\u00e0 del Salento|publisher=}}</ref> Florence, Naples and Rome, as three years course (like a BSc) of \"Scienze e tecnologie fisiche\" as a sector of the Physics Department. Additionally, courses are available at some private institutions (as at Vinci Institute near Firenze) that offer advanced professional education for already qualified opticians (most of the Italian optometrists are also qualified opticians, i.e. \"ottico abilitato\"). In the last thirty years several verdicts from High Court (Cassazione) proof that optometry is a free practice and has truly education path.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sopti.it/optometria-in-sintesi/ | title=OPTOMETRIA IN SINTESI |website=SOPTI - Societ\u00e0 Optometrica Italiana}}</ref>\n\n====Norway====\nIn Norway, the optometric profession has been regulated as a healthcare profession since 1988. After a three-year bachelor program, one can practice basic optometry. At least one year in clinical practice qualify for a post-degree half-year sandwich course in contact lens fitting, which is regulated as a healthcare speciality. A separate regulation for the use of diagnostic drugs in optometric practice was introduced in 2004.\n\n====Russia====\nIn [[Russia]], optometry education has been accredited by the Federal Agency of Health and Social Development.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\nThere are only two educational institutions that teach optometry in Russia: Saint Petersburg Medical Technical College, formerly known as St. Petersburg College of Medical Electronics and Optics, and The Helmholtz Research Institute for Eye Diseases. They both belong and are regulated by the Ministry of Health. The optometry program is a four-year program. It includes one to two science foundation years, one year focused on clinical and proficiency skills, and one year of clinical rotations in hospitals. Graduates take college/state [[examinations]] and then receive a specialist [[diploma]]. This diploma is valid for only five years and must be renewed every five years after receiving additional training at state-accredited programs.\n\nThe scope of practice for optometrists in Russia includes refraction, contact lens fitting, spectacles construction and lens fitting (dispensing), low vision aids, foreign body removal, referrals to other specialists after clinical condition diagnoses (management of diseases in the eye).\n\n====United Kingdom====\n===== Licensing =====\nOptometrists in the United Kingdom are regulated by the [[General Optical Council]] under the Opticians Act 1989 and distinguished from medical practitioners.<ref name=\"Opticians Act 1989\">[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/44/pdfs/ukpga_19890044_en.pdf Opticians Act 1989] (cap. 44)</ref> Registration with the GOC is mandatory to practice optometry in the UK.

During this year the pre-registration candidate is given a number of quarterly assessments, often including temporary posting at a hospital, and on successfully passing all of these assessments, a final one-day set of examinations (details correct for candidates from 2006 onwards). Following successful completion of these assessments and having completed one year's supervised practice, the candidate is eligible to register as an optometrist with the [[General Optical Council]] (GOC) and, should they so wish, are entitled to membership of the [[College of Optometrists]].  Twelve universities offer Optometry in the UK: [[Anglia Ruskin University|Anglia Ruskin]], [[Aston University|Aston]], [[University of Bradford|Bradford]], [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], [[City, University of London|City]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow Caledonian]], [[University of Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Plymouth]], [[Ulster University at Coleraine]], [[University of Portsmouth]] and [[University of the West of England, Bristol]].\n\nIn 2008 the UK moved forward to offer the Doctor of Optometry postgraduate program. This became available at the [[Institute of Optometry]] in London in partnership with [[London South Bank University]].<ref>Agarwal, R.

A majority of respondents were in favour of optometrists extending their professional role by treating external eye conditions and prescribing broad-spectrum topical antibiotics through additional training and certification.\n\nSince 2009, optometrists in the UK have been able to undertake additional postgraduate training and qualifications that allow them to prescribe medications to treat and manage eye conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/CPD/Therapeutics/independent-prescribing/index.cfm |title=Independent Prescribing|website=The College of Optometrists}}</ref>  There are currently three registerable specialities:\n* '''Additional supply speciality ''' - to write orders for, and supply in an emergency, a range of drugs in addition to those ordered or supplied by a normal optometrist.\n* '''Supplementary prescribing speciality ''' -  to manage a patient's clinical condition and prescribe medicines according to a clinical management plan set up in conjunction with an independent prescriber, such as a GP or ophthalmologist or qualified optometrist.\n* '''Independent prescribing specialty''' - to take responsibility for the clinical assessment of a patient, establish a diagnosis and determine the clinical management required, including prescribing where necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.optical.org/en/Education/Specialty_qualifications/Therapeutic_Prescribing_Specialties.cfm|title=Therapeutic Prescribing specialties|first=Liz|last=Carr|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===North America===\n[[File: Optometry helps keep the focus on the mission 150707-F-IT851-012.jpg|thumb|A technician at Aviano Air Base Optometry Clinic measures the intraocular pressure of a patient with a handheld tonometer, July 7, 2015.]]\n\n====Canada====\n===== Training =====\nIn Canada, Doctors of Optometry (O.D.) typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four to five years of optometry studies (graduate level), accredited by the Accreditation Council on Optometric Education. There are two such schools of optometry located in Canada\u200a\u2014\u200athe [[University of Waterloo]] and the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montreal]]. Canada also recognizes degrees from the twenty US schools.\n\n===== Licensing =====\nIn Canada, Doctors of Optometry must write national written and practical board exams. Additionally, optometrists are required to become licensed in the province in which they wish to practice. Regulatory of professions is within [[Section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867|provincial jurisdiction]]. Therefore, regulation of optometry is unique to individual provinces and territories. In Ontario, optometrists are licensed by the College of Optometrists of Ontario.\n\n===== Representation =====\nIn Canada, the profession is represented by the [[Canadian Association of Optometrists]].

(optometrists) may prescribe corrective lenses (glasses and contacts) to aid refractive errors (e.g., myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, astigmatism, double vision). They manage vision development in children including amblyopia diagnosis/treatment. Some perform vision therapy. They are trained and state-licensed to diagnose and manage ocular diseases (ophthalmology - a branch of medicine diagnosing and treating eye disease) and their associations with systemic health. Common eye conditions managed include infections (bacterial/viral), allergy, inflammation (uveitis), diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration etc. They may also remove ocular foreign bodies and can order blood panels or imaging studies (CT/MRI). However, optometrists are not trained to perform invasive surgery (i.e. cataract/retina surgery) like ophthalmologists are. Although In Oklahoma and Louisiana, optometrists may perform minor surgeries within the anterior segment of the eye. Moreover, Kentucky {{when|date=June 2019}} legislation permits optometrists to perform certain laser procedures. Optometrists co-manage with many other medical professionals when certain eye diseases are associated with underlying systemic causes and thus frequent communication with other specialists may be required: eg: Aids/Hiv, neuro, rheumatology, oncology. \n\n\nOphthalmologists are Doctors of Medicine (MD/DO) who usually provide speciality eye care. Their training is heavily focused on surgery and is usually based in one or more particular areas of the eye: eg: cornea, retina, glaucoma, strabismus. They typically deal with a late-stage eye disease which often can only be treated with surgical intervention. \n\n\nOpticians are not doctors, however, they are an important part of eye care. They are trained and licensed to cut, fit and adjust eyeglass frames/lenses. They are experts in lens types and wearing modalities: eg. progressive, bifocal, single vision, lens index, coatings.\n\n===== Regulation =====\nDoctors of optometry in the United States are regulated by state boards, which vary from state to state. \nThe Association of Regulatory Boards of Optometry (ARBO) assists these state board licensing agencies in regulating the practice of optometry.\n\n===== Licensing =====\nOptometrists must complete all course work and graduate from an accredited College of Optometry. This includes passage of all parts of the national board examinations as well as local jurisprudence examinations, which vary by state.\n\n===== Education and Training =====\nDoctors of Optometry (O.D.) (Optometrist) most typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four years of eye-specific training (Optometry school). Some continue with an optional year of study in a speciality area (residency). Training takes place in colleges of optometry, hospitals, clinics and private practices. The program includes classroom and clinical training in geometric, physical, physiological and ophthalmic optics, speciality contact lens evaluation and fitting, general anatomy, ocular anatomy, ocular disease, pharmacology, ocular pharmacology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the visual system, pediatric visual development, gerontology, binocular vision, colour vision, form, space, movement and vision perception, systemic disease, histology, microbiology, sensory and perceptual psychology, biochemistry, statistics and epidemiology\n\n\nAdmission to Optometry school is very competitive. Applicants must take the Optometry Admission Test (OAT) and have excellent undergraduate grades to apply. To graduate, candidates must pass all three parts of the National Board of Examiners of Optometry (NBEO).  Part 1 NBEO is a two-day written exam. Part 2 is a computer-based exam, takes all day and is based on clinical studies including the treatment and management of the ocular disease. Part three is a practical exam that must be taken in person in North Carolina. Once a candidate has successfully completed all applicable coursework, clinical rotations, passed all parts of NBEO exams, and satisfied all financial obligations (US $200,000+), a Doctor of Optometry degree will be conferred.\n\n\nOptometrists are required to obtain continuing education credit hours to maintain licensure.\n\n===Oceania===\n====Australia====\nAustralia currently has five recognized courses in optometry, and one course seeking to obtain accreditation with the Optometry council of Australia and New Zealand :\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry (BVisSci MOptom), [[Deakin University]]\n* Bachelor of Medical Science (Vision Science) and Master of Optometry, [[Flinders University]]\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Clinical Optometry (BVisSc MClinOptom), [[University of New South Wales]]\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, [[Queensland University of Technology]]\n* Doctor of Optometry, [[Melbourne University]] ([[post-graduate]])\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, [[University of Canberra]] (Seeking accreditation)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/course?course_cd=372JA&version_number=1|title=Course - University of Canberra|website=www.canberra.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref>\n\nTo support these courses the [[Australian College of Optometry]] provides clinical placements to undergraduate students from Australian Universities and abroad.\n\nin 2016, almost 5000 optometrists in general practice were licensed with their regulatory body, the [http://www.optometryboard.gov.au/ Optometry Board of Australia].

Modern-day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the educational curriculum additionally includes significant training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease, in most of the countries of the world, where the profession is established and regulated.\n\n'''Optometrists''' (also known as '''doctors of optometry''' in the United States and Canada, by a higher degree in the United Kingdom and worldwide for those holding the O.D. degree) are health care professionals who provide primary eye care through refractions and comprehensive [[eye examination]]s to detect and treat various vision abnormalities and eye diseases. Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location. Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry (i.e. those requiring certain surgical interventions) are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] who are physicians that specialize in the medical and surgical care of the eye. Optometrists typically work closely together with other [[eye care professional]]s such as ophthalmologists and [[optician]]s to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe term \"optometry\" comes from the Greek words ''[[wikt:\u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2]]'' (''opsis''; \"view\") and ''[[wikt:\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]]'' (''metron''; \"something used to measure\", \"measure\", \"rule\"). The word entered the language when the instrument for measuring vision was called an [[Optometer (ophthalmic instrument)|optometer]], (before the terms [[phoropter]] or refractor were used). The root word ''opto'' is a shortened form derived from the Greek word ''ophthalmos'' meaning, \"eye.\" Like most healthcare professions, the education and certification of optometrists are regulated in most countries. Optometric professionals and optometry-related organizations interact with governmental agencies, other healthcare professionals, and the community to deliver eye and vision care.\n\n==Definition of optometry and optometrist==\n[[File: Optometrista.jpeg|thumbnail|An optometrist examining the eyes of a patient with a [[slit lamp]] biomicroscope]]\nThe [[World Council of Optometry]],  [[World Health Organization]] and about 75 optometry organisations from over 40 countries have all over the world adopted the following definition, to be used to describe optometry and optometrist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/our_members/index.cfm/page/1/|title=Case study|first=Pixl8|last=Developer|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202015502/http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/our_members/index.cfm/page/1/|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{block quote|Optometry is a healthcare profession that is autonomous, educated, and regulated (licensed/registered), and optometrists are the primary healthcare practitioners of the eye and visual system who provide comprehensive eye and vision care, which includes refraction and dispensing, detection/diagnosis and management of disease in the eye, and the rehabilitation of conditions of the visual system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/about-wco/who-is-an-optometrist/|title=Who is an optometrist?|first=Laura|last=Prieto|publisher=}}</ref>}}\nBeing an optometrist always made me regretful rather than being proud.

In the year 1958, two schools of optometry were established, one at Gandhi Eye Hospital, Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh and another one at [[Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital]], Hyderabad in Telangana, under the second five-year plan by Director General of Health Services of Government of India. These schools offered diplomas in optometry courses of two years duration validated by State Medical Faculties.\n\nSubsequently, four more schools were opened across India situated at Sitapur Eye Hospital, Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, Chennai (formerly Madras) in Tamil Nadu, Bengalooru (formerly Bangalore) in Karnataka and Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum) in Kerala.<ref>Agarwal, R.

Today, optometry courses are well received by citizens. More universities and higher education studies are about to implement the courses, e.g., [[National Institute of Ophthalmic Sciences]] in [[Petaling Jaya]] whereby it is the academic arm of [[The Tun Hussein Onn National Eye Hospital]]. Other public universities that provide this course are University Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). There is also a private university that provides this course such as Management and Science University (MSU) and SeGi University.\nAfter completing the study in Degree in Optometry, the optometrist who practices in Malaysia  must register under Malaysian Optical Council (MOC) which is the organisation under the Ministry of Health\n\n====Pakistan====\nOptometry is taught as a five/four-year Doctor/ Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors course at many institutions notable among which are Department of Optometry & Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore, Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology (PICO) Peshawar, College of Ophthalmology & Allied Vision Sciences (COAVS) Lahore and Al-Shifa Institute of Ophthalmology Islamabad. After graduation, the optometrists can join a four-tiered service delivery level (Centre of Excellence, Tertiary/Teaching, District headquarter and sub-district /Tehsil headquarters). M.Phil in Optometry is also available at select institutions such as King Edward Medical University, Lahore\nDepartment of Optometry & Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore started bridging programmes for Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors to become Doctor of Optometry OD, Post Professional Doctor of Optometry(PP-OD), Transitional Doctor of Optometry(t-OD).\nOptometry is not yet a regulated field in Pakistan as there is no professional licensing board or authority responsible for issuing practise licenses to qualified optometrists. This creates difficulty for Pakistani optometrists who wish to register abroad.\nThe University of Lahore has recently launched Doctor of optometry (OD).\nImam Hussain Medical University also has launched Doctor of Optometry Program. Chairman Imam Hussain Medical University Dr Sabir Hussain Babachan has vowed to regulate OD curriculum according to international standard.\n\n====Philippines====\nOptometry is regulated by the Professional Regulation Commission of the Philippines. To be eligible for licensing, each candidate must have satisfactorily completed a doctor of optometry course at an accredited institution and demonstrate good moral character with no previous record of professional misconduct. Professional organizations of optometry in the Philippines include Optometric Association of the Philippines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philippineoptometry.net/|title=Optometry Update - Optometry News And Updates|publisher=}}</ref> and Integrated Philippine Association of Optometrists, Inc. (IPAO).\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nIn Saudi Arabia, optometrists must complete a five-year doctor of optometry degree from Qassim University and King Saud University also they must complete a two-year residency.\n\n====Singapore====\nTertiary education for optometrists takes 3 years at the following institutions.\n\nSingapore Polytechnic - Diploma in Optometry [[Singapore Polytechnic]]\n\nNgee Ann Polytechnic - Diploma in Optometry [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]]\n\n====Thailand====\nSince late 1990, Thailand has set a goal to provide more than 600 optometrists to meet the minimal public demands and international standards in vision care. There are more than three university degree programs in Thailand. Each program accepts students that have completed grade 12th or the third year in high school (following US education model). These programs offer \"Doctor of Optometry\" degree to graduates from the program that will take six years to complete the courses. Practising optometrists will also be required to pass licensing examination (three parts examinations) that is administrated through a committee under the Ministry of Public Health.\n\nNowadays, the number of practising optometrists in Thailand is still less than one hundred (2015). However, it has projected that the number of practising optometrists in Thailand will greatly increase within the next ten years. In the theoretical scenario, the number of optometrists should be able to meet minimal public demands around 2030 or earlier.\n\n===Europe===\nSince the formation of the [[European Union]], \"there exists a strong movement, headed by the Association of European Schools and Colleges of Optometry (AESCO), to unify the profession by creating a European-wide examination for optometry\" and presumably also standardized practice and education guidelines within EU countries.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamakiotes DS, Thal LS |title=The unification of European optometry: how the profession will change after 1992 |journal=J Am Optom Assoc |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=904\u201313 |date=December 1991 |pmid=1814983 }}</ref> The first examinations of the new European Diploma in Optometry were held in 1998 and this was a landmark event for optometry in continental Europe.<ref>Agarwal, R.

After protests from the department of Optics at Technological Educational Institute of Athens (the only department of Optics in Greece, until 2006), the Government changed the names of the departments to \"Optics and Optometry\" and included lessons in both optics and optometry. Optometrists-Opticians have to complete a 4-year undergraduate honours degree. Then the graduates can be admitted to postgraduate courses in Optometry at universities around the world.\n\nSince 2015, a Master of Science (MSc) course in Optometry is offered by the Technological Educational Institute of Athens.\n\nThe Institute of Vision and Optics (IVO) of the University of Crete focuses on the sciences of vision and is active in the fields of research, training, technology development and provision of medical services. Professor [[Ioannis Pallikaris]] has received numerous awards and recognitions for the Institute's contribution to [[ophthalmology]]. In 1989 he performed the first [[LASIK]] procedure on a [[human eye]].\n\n====Hungary====\nOptometrist education takes 4 years in the medical universities in Hungary, and they will get a Bachelor of Science degree. They work in networks and retail stores and private optics, very few are located in the Health Care care system as [[ophthalmologist]]s as an assistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.optikaimagazin.hu/a-latszeresz-es-az-optometrista-kepzes-aktualis-helyzete-magyarorszagon/|title=A l\u00e1tszer\u00e9sz- \u00e9s az optometrista-k\u00e9pz\u00e9s aktu\u00e1lis helyzete Magyarorsz\u00e1gon - Optikai Magazin Online|date=1 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Ireland====\nThe profession of Optometry has been represented for over a century by the Association of Optometrists, Ireland [AOI]. In [[Ireland]] an optometrist must first complete a four-year degree in optometry at [[Dublin Institute of Technology]]. Following successful completion of the degree, an optometrist must then complete professional qualifying examinations to enter the register of the Opticians Board [Bord na Radharcmhaistoiri]. Optometrists must be registered with the Board to practice in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe A.O.I. runs a comprehensive continuing education and professional development program on behalf of Irish optometrists. The legislation governing optometry was drafted in 1956. Some feel that the legislation restricts optometrists from using their full range of skills, training and equipment for the benefit of the Irish public. The amendment to the Act in 2003 addressed one of the most significant restrictions: the use of [[cycloplegic]] drugs to examine children.\n\n====Italy====\nIn Italy Optometry is an unregulated profession. It is taught at seven universities: Padua, Turin, Milan, [[University of Salento|Salento]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienzemfn.unisalento.it/cdl_ottica_optometria|title=Facolta di Scienze MM.FF.NN. :: Corso di Laurea in Ottica ed Optometria - Universit\u00e0 del Salento|publisher=}}</ref> Florence, Naples and Rome, as three years course (like a BSc) of \"Scienze e tecnologie fisiche\" as a sector of the Physics Department. Additionally, courses are available at some private institutions (as at Vinci Institute near Firenze) that offer advanced professional education for already qualified opticians (most of the Italian optometrists are also qualified opticians, i.e. \"ottico abilitato\"). In the last thirty years several verdicts from High Court (Cassazione) proof that optometry is a free practice and has truly education path.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sopti.it/optometria-in-sintesi/ | title=OPTOMETRIA IN SINTESI |website=SOPTI - Societ\u00e0 Optometrica Italiana}}</ref>\n\n====Norway====\nIn Norway, the optometric profession has been regulated as a healthcare profession since 1988. After a three-year bachelor program, one can practice basic optometry. At least one year in clinical practice qualify for a post-degree half-year sandwich course in contact lens fitting, which is regulated as a healthcare speciality. A separate regulation for the use of diagnostic drugs in optometric practice was introduced in 2004.\n\n====Russia====\nIn [[Russia]], optometry education has been accredited by the Federal Agency of Health and Social Development.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\nThere are only two educational institutions that teach optometry in Russia: Saint Petersburg Medical Technical College, formerly known as St. Petersburg College of Medical Electronics and Optics, and The Helmholtz Research Institute for Eye Diseases. They both belong and are regulated by the Ministry of Health. The optometry program is a four-year program. It includes one to two science foundation years, one year focused on clinical and proficiency skills, and one year of clinical rotations in hospitals. Graduates take college/state [[examinations]] and then receive a specialist [[diploma]]. This diploma is valid for only five years and must be renewed every five years after receiving additional training at state-accredited programs.\n\nThe scope of practice for optometrists in Russia includes refraction, contact lens fitting, spectacles construction and lens fitting (dispensing), low vision aids, foreign body removal, referrals to other specialists after clinical condition diagnoses (management of diseases in the eye).\n\n====United Kingdom====\n===== Licensing =====\nOptometrists in the United Kingdom are regulated by the [[General Optical Council]] under the Opticians Act 1989 and distinguished from medical practitioners.<ref name=\"Opticians Act 1989\">[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/44/pdfs/ukpga_19890044_en.pdf Opticians Act 1989] (cap. 44)</ref> Registration with the GOC is mandatory to practice optometry in the UK.

The elderly and those with some chronic conditions like diabetes get free periodic tests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/help-with-health-costs/free-nhs-eye-tests-and-optical-vouchers/|title=Free NHS eye tests and optical vouchers|publisher=NHS|date=2018-08-14}}</ref> Treatment for eye conditions such as glaucoma and cataracts is free and checked for during normal eye examinations.\n\n===== Training =====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], optometrists have to complete a 3 or 4 ([[Scotland]]) year undergraduate honours degree followed by a minimum of a one-year \"pre-registration period\", (internship), where they complete clinical practice under the supervision of a qualified and experienced practitioner. During this year the pre-registration candidate is given a number of quarterly assessments, often including temporary posting at a hospital, and on successfully passing all of these assessments, a final one-day set of examinations (details correct for candidates from 2006 onwards). Following successful completion of these assessments and having completed one year's supervised practice, the candidate is eligible to register as an optometrist with the [[General Optical Council]] (GOC) and, should they so wish, are entitled to membership of the [[College of Optometrists]].  Twelve universities offer Optometry in the UK: [[Anglia Ruskin University|Anglia Ruskin]], [[Aston University|Aston]], [[University of Bradford|Bradford]], [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], [[City, University of London|City]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow Caledonian]], [[University of Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Plymouth]], [[Ulster University at Coleraine]], [[University of Portsmouth]] and [[University of the West of England, Bristol]].\n\nIn 2008 the UK moved forward to offer the Doctor of Optometry postgraduate program. This became available at the [[Institute of Optometry]] in London in partnership with [[London South Bank University]].<ref>Agarwal, R.

(1996), British optometry: medical practitioner's opinion survey, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 4(2), 50-52.</ref> at City, University of London. A majority of respondents were in favour of optometrists extending their professional role by treating external eye conditions and prescribing broad-spectrum topical antibiotics through additional training and certification.\n\nSince 2009, optometrists in the UK have been able to undertake additional postgraduate training and qualifications that allow them to prescribe medications to treat and manage eye conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/CPD/Therapeutics/independent-prescribing/index.cfm |title=Independent Prescribing|website=The College of Optometrists}}</ref>  There are currently three registerable specialities:\n* '''Additional supply speciality ''' - to write orders for, and supply in an emergency, a range of drugs in addition to those ordered or supplied by a normal optometrist.\n* '''Supplementary prescribing speciality ''' -  to manage a patient's clinical condition and prescribe medicines according to a clinical management plan set up in conjunction with an independent prescriber, such as a GP or ophthalmologist or qualified optometrist.\n* '''Independent prescribing specialty''' - to take responsibility for the clinical assessment of a patient, establish a diagnosis and determine the clinical management required, including prescribing where necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.optical.org/en/Education/Specialty_qualifications/Therapeutic_Prescribing_Specialties.cfm|title=Therapeutic Prescribing specialties|first=Liz|last=Carr|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===North America===\n[[File: Optometry helps keep the focus on the mission 150707-F-IT851-012.jpg|thumb|A technician at Aviano Air Base Optometry Clinic measures the intraocular pressure of a patient with a handheld tonometer, July 7, 2015.]]\n\n====Canada====\n===== Training =====\nIn Canada, Doctors of Optometry (O.D.) typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four to five years of optometry studies (graduate level), accredited by the Accreditation Council on Optometric Education. There are two such schools of optometry located in Canada\u200a\u2014\u200athe [[University of Waterloo]] and the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montreal]]. Canada also recognizes degrees from the twenty US schools.\n\n===== Licensing =====\nIn Canada, Doctors of Optometry must write national written and practical board exams. Additionally, optometrists are required to become licensed in the province in which they wish to practice. Regulatory of professions is within [[Section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867|provincial jurisdiction]]. Therefore, regulation of optometry is unique to individual provinces and territories. In Ontario, optometrists are licensed by the College of Optometrists of Ontario.\n\n===== Representation =====\nIn Canada, the profession is represented by the [[Canadian Association of Optometrists]].  In the province of Ontario, the Ontario Association of Optometrists is the designated representative of optometrists to the provincial government.\n\n===== Scope of Practice =====\nOptometrists in Canada are trained and licensed to be primary eye care providers. They provide optical and medical eye care. They are able to diagnose and treat most eye diseases and can prescribe both topical and oral medications<ref>{{cite web |url=https://opto.ca/sites/default/files/resources/documents/optometry_scope_across_canada_grid_january_2016_0.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410083022/https://opto.ca/sites/default/files/resources/documents/optometry_scope_across_canada_grid_january_2016_0.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-04-10 |title=Optometic scope of practice across Canada |publisher=Canadian Association of Optometrists |date=January 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nDoctors of Optometry (O.D.)

(optometrists) may prescribe corrective lenses (glasses and contacts) to aid refractive errors (e.g., myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, astigmatism, double vision). They manage vision development in children including amblyopia diagnosis/treatment. Some perform vision therapy. They are trained and state-licensed to diagnose and manage ocular diseases (ophthalmology - a branch of medicine diagnosing and treating eye disease) and their associations with systemic health. Common eye conditions managed include infections (bacterial/viral), allergy, inflammation (uveitis), diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration etc. They may also remove ocular foreign bodies and can order blood panels or imaging studies (CT/MRI). However, optometrists are not trained to perform invasive surgery (i.e. cataract/retina surgery) like ophthalmologists are. Although In Oklahoma and Louisiana, optometrists may perform minor surgeries within the anterior segment of the eye. Moreover, Kentucky {{when|date=June 2019}} legislation permits optometrists to perform certain laser procedures. Optometrists co-manage with many other medical professionals when certain eye diseases are associated with underlying systemic causes and thus frequent communication with other specialists may be required: eg: Aids/Hiv, neuro, rheumatology, oncology. \n\n\nOphthalmologists are Doctors of Medicine (MD/DO) who usually provide speciality eye care. Their training is heavily focused on surgery and is usually based in one or more particular areas of the eye: eg: cornea, retina, glaucoma, strabismus. They typically deal with a late-stage eye disease which often can only be treated with surgical intervention. \n\n\nOpticians are not doctors, however, they are an important part of eye care. They are trained and licensed to cut, fit and adjust eyeglass frames/lenses. They are experts in lens types and wearing modalities: eg. progressive, bifocal, single vision, lens index, coatings.\n\n===== Regulation =====\nDoctors of optometry in the United States are regulated by state boards, which vary from state to state. \nThe Association of Regulatory Boards of Optometry (ARBO) assists these state board licensing agencies in regulating the practice of optometry.\n\n===== Licensing =====\nOptometrists must complete all course work and graduate from an accredited College of Optometry. This includes passage of all parts of the national board examinations as well as local jurisprudence examinations, which vary by state.\n\n===== Education and Training =====\nDoctors of Optometry (O.D.) (Optometrist) most typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four years of eye-specific training (Optometry school). Some continue with an optional year of study in a speciality area (residency). Training takes place in colleges of optometry, hospitals, clinics and private practices. The program includes classroom and clinical training in geometric, physical, physiological and ophthalmic optics, speciality contact lens evaluation and fitting, general anatomy, ocular anatomy, ocular disease, pharmacology, ocular pharmacology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the visual system, pediatric visual development, gerontology, binocular vision, colour vision, form, space, movement and vision perception, systemic disease, histology, microbiology, sensory and perceptual psychology, biochemistry, statistics and epidemiology\n\n\nAdmission to Optometry school is very competitive. Applicants must take the Optometry Admission Test (OAT) and have excellent undergraduate grades to apply. To graduate, candidates must pass all three parts of the National Board of Examiners of Optometry (NBEO).  Part 1 NBEO is a two-day written exam. Part 2 is a computer-based exam, takes all day and is based on clinical studies including the treatment and management of the ocular disease. Part three is a practical exam that must be taken in person in North Carolina. Once a candidate has successfully completed all applicable coursework, clinical rotations, passed all parts of NBEO exams, and satisfied all financial obligations (US $200,000+), a Doctor of Optometry degree will be conferred.\n\n\nOptometrists are required to obtain continuing education credit hours to maintain licensure.\n\n===Oceania===\n====Australia====\nAustralia currently has five recognized courses in optometry, and one course seeking to obtain accreditation with the Optometry council of Australia and New Zealand :\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry (BVisSci MOptom), [[Deakin University]]\n* Bachelor of Medical Science (Vision Science) and Master of Optometry, [[Flinders University]]\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Clinical Optometry (BVisSc MClinOptom), [[University of New South Wales]]\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, [[Queensland University of Technology]]\n* Doctor of Optometry, [[Melbourne University]] ([[post-graduate]])\n* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, [[University of Canberra]] (Seeking accreditation)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/course?course_cd=372JA&version_number=1|title=Course - University of Canberra|website=www.canberra.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref>\n\nTo support these courses the [[Australian College of Optometry]] provides clinical placements to undergraduate students from Australian Universities and abroad.\n\nin 2016, almost 5000 optometrists in general practice were licensed with their regulatory body, the [http://www.optometryboard.gov.au/ Optometry Board of Australia].  Of these, approximately 2300 were registered with the scheduled medicines endorsement, which enables them to prescribe some medicines for the treatment of conditions of the eye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.optometryboard.gov.au/About/Statistics.aspx|title=Optometry Board of Australia - Statistics|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nNew Zealand currently has one recognised course in optometry:\n* Bachelor of Optometry (BOptom), [[The University of Auckland]]\n\nIn July 2014, the Medicines Amendment Act 2013 and Misuse of Drugs Amendment Regulations 2014 came into effect.  Among other things, the changes to the Act name optometrists as authorised prescribers.  This change enables optometrists with a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent (TPA) endorsement to prescribe all medicines appropriate to their scope of practice, rather than limiting them to a list of medicines specified in the regulation; this recognises the safe and appropriate prescribing practice of optometrists over the previous nine years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odob.health.nz/cms_display.php?sn=74&st=1&pg=1564|title=GLA|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\n====Brazil====\nThe Brazilian Government does not state rules about optometry, and the Brazilian Council of Ophthalmology recommends against its official legal recognition.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe CBOO (Brazilian Council of Optics and Optometry), which is affiliated to the WCO ([[World Council of Optometry]]), represents Brazilian optometrists. In conjunction with organizations representative weight of Brazilian companies, including the National Commerce Confederation for goods, services and tourism (CNC), through the CB\u00d3ptica/CNC, its defence arm of the optometric and optical industry, are defending the right of free and independent practice of optometrists, even if it is against the interests of ophthalmologists.\n\nThe Federal Supreme Court (STF), the Brazilian Court of Justice and the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), another important National Court, ruled several processes granting inquestionable victories to ophthalmologists.\n\nIn Brazilian law, however, there is an explicit recommendation that the one prescribing corrective lenses are prohibited to sell them. This restricting rule to the ophthalmologists has to keep the optic shops away from Hospitals and Eye Care Clinics since 1930, and it has to be reviewed before any further regulation for the optometrists.\n\n====Colombia====\nIn [[Colombia]], optometry education has been accredited by the Ministry of Health.

{"title_page": "Brand awareness", "text_new": "{{marketing}}\n'''Brand awareness''' refers to the extent to which customers are able to ''recall'' or ''recognise'' a [[brand]]. Brand awareness is a key consideration in [[Consumer Behaviour|consumer behavior]], [[advertising management]], [[brand management]] and strategy development. The consumer's ability to recognise or recall a brand is central to purchasing decision-making. Purchasing cannot proceed unless a consumer is first aware of a product category and a brand within that category. Awareness does not necessarily mean that the consumer must be able to recall a specific brand name, but he or she must be able to recall sufficient distinguishing features for purchasing to proceed. For instance, if a consumer asks her friend to buy her some gum in a \"blue pack\", the friend would be expected to know which gum to buy, even though neither friend can recall the precise brand name at the time.\n\nDifferent types of brand awareness have been identified, namely ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition''. Key researchers argue that these different types of awareness operate in fundamentally different ways and that this has important implications for the purchase decision process and for marketing communications. Brand awareness is closely related to concepts such as the ''evoked set'' and ''consideration set'' which describe specific aspects of the consumer's purchase decision. Consumers are believed to hold between three and seven brands in their consideration set across a broad range of product categories. Consumers will normally purchase one of the top three brands in their  consideration set.\n\nBrand awareness is a key indicator of a brand's competitive market performance. Given the importance of brand awareness in consumer purchasing decisions, marketers have developed a number of metrics designed to measure brand awareness and other measures of brand health. These metrics are collectively known as '''A'''wareness, '''A'''ttitudes and '''U'''sage (AAU) metrics.\n\nTo ensure a product or brand's market success, awareness levels must be managed across the entire product life-cycle - from product launch through to market decline. Many marketers regularly monitor brand awareness levels, and if they fall below a predetermined threshold, the advertising and promotional effort is intensified until awareness returns to the desired level.\n\n== Importance of brand awareness ==\n\nBrand awareness is related to the functions of brand identities in consumers\u2019 memory and can be measured by how well the consumers can identify the brand under various conditions.<ref name=\"Keller 1993\">{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin|title=Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity|journal=The Journal of Marketing|year=1993|volume=1|issue=22}}</ref> Brand awareness is also central to understanding the consumer purchase decision process. Strong brand awareness can be a predictor of brand success.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ya-Hsin, H., Ya-hei, H., Suh-Yueh, C., & Wenchang, F. (2014). Is Brand Awareness a Marketing Placebo?.

Every year advertisers invest substantial sums of money attempting to improve a brand's overall awareness levels. Many marketers regularly monitor brand awareness levels, and if they fall below a predetermined threshold, the advertising and promotional effort is intensified until awareness returns to the desired level. Setting brand awareness goals/ objectives is a key decision in marketing planning and strategy development.\n\nBrand awareness is one of major brand assets that adds value to the product, service or company.<ref name=\":7\">Aaker, D.

For the assets and liabilities to have effect on brand equity, they have to be related to the name or logo of the brand. If the brand's name or logo changes, then, it can either have a positive or a negative impact on the assets and liabilities of the brand, with some of them getting transferred to the new name and logo. The brand equity stands on the assets and liabilities and it can differ from factor to factor such as, brand loyalty, brand name awareness, how a customer perceives the quality of a brand, and other proprietary assets such as patent and trademark.<ref>{{cite book |last1=A.

E., & Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012</ref> These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.\n\n=== Brand recall===\n\nBrand recall is also known as ''unaided recall'' or ''spontaneous recall'' and refers to the ability of the consumers to correctly elicit a brand name from memory when prompted by a product category.<ref name=\"Keller 1993\"/> Brand recall indicates a relatively strong link between a category and a brand while brand recognition indicates a weaker link. When prompted by a product category, most consumers can only recall a relatively small set of brands, typically around 3\u20135 brand names. In consumer tests, few consumers can recall more than seven brand names within a given category and for low-interest product categories, most consumers can only recall one or two brand names.<ref>Trout, J. and Ries, A., \"The Positioning Era Cometh\", ''Advertising Age'' [Special Feature on Positioning], 24 April 1972</ref>\n\nResearch suggests that the number of brands that consumers can recall is affected by both individual and product factors including; brand loyalty, awareness set size, situational, usage factors and education level.<ref>Reilly, M. and Parkinson, T.L., \"Individual and Product Correlates of Evoked Set Size For Consumer Package Goods\", in '' Advances in Consumer Research,''  Vol. 12, Elizabeth C. Hirschman and Moris B. Holbrook (eds), Provo, UT: Association for Consumer Research, pp 492-497, Online: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6440/volumes/v12/NA-12</ref> For instance, consumers who are involved with a category, such as heavy users or product enthusiasts, may be able to recall a slightly larger set of brand names than those who are less involved.\n\n===Brand recognition===\n\nBrand recognition is also known as ''aided recall'' and refers to the ability of the consumers to correctly differentiate the brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify the brand name. Instead, it means that consumers can recognise the brand when presented with it at the point-of-sale or after viewing its visual packaging.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology & Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263\u2013274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}</ref> In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognise it.\n\n==== Top-of-mind awareness====\n\nConsumers will normally purchase one of the top three brands in their consideration set. This is known as  \n[[top-of-mind awareness]].<ref>Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,''pp 17-19</ref> Consequently, one of the goals for most marketing communications is to increase the probability that consumers will include the brand in their consideration sets.\n\nBy definition, top-of-mind awareness is \"the first brand that comes to mind when a customer is asked an unprompted question about a category.\"<ref>Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education,</ref> When discussing top-of-mind awareness among larger groups of consumers (as opposed to a single consumer), it is more often defined as the \"most remembered\" or \"most recalled\" brand name(s).<ref>See, for instance, Koniewski, M., \"Brand Awareness and Brand Loyalty\", ''PMR Research Paper'', Feb, 2012, www.research-pmr.com</ref>\n\nA brand that  enjoys top-of-mind awareness will generally be considered as a genuine purchase option, provided that the consumer is favourably disposed to the brand name.<ref>Manternach, L. (2011). Does your brand have top of mind awareness?. ''Corridor Business Journal'', ''7''(52), 26.</ref>  Top-of-mind awareness is relevant when consumers make a quick choice between competing brands in low-involvement categories or for impulse type purchases.<ref name=\":0\">Driesener, C., Paech, S., Romaniuk, J., & Sharp, B., \"Brand and Advertising Awareness: A Replication and extension of a known empirical generalization,\" ''Australasian Marketing Journal'', vol. 12, no. 3, 2004, pp  70-80</ref>\n\n=== Marketing implications of brand awareness===\n\nClearly brand awareness is closely related to the concepts of the ''evoked set'' (defined as the set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when contemplating a purchase) and the ''consideration set'' (defined as the \u201csmall set of brands which a consumer pays close attention to when making a purchase decision\u201d).<ref>Howard, J. A., & Sheth, J.N. (1969). ''The Theory of Buyer Behaviour''. Wiley, N.Y.</ref> One of the central roles of advertising is to create both brand awareness and brand image, in order to increase the likelihood that a brand is included in the consumer's evoked set or consideration set and regarded favourably. <ref>Meenaghan, R., \"The role of advertising in brand image development\", ''Journal of Product and Brand Management'', Vol. 4, no. 4, 1995, pp.23 - 34</ref>\n\nConsumers do not learn about products and brands from advertising alone. When making purchase decisions, consumers acquire information from a wide variety of sources in order to inform their decisions. After searching for information about a category, consumers may become aware of a larger number of brands which collectively are known as the ''awareness set''.<ref>Chon, K.Y., Pizam, A. and Mansfeld, Y., ''Consumer Behavior in Travel and Tourism'', 2nd ed, 2000, New York, Haworth, pp 86-87</ref> Thus, the awareness set is likely to change as consumers acquire new information about brands or products.  A review of empirical studies in this area suggests that the consideration set is likely to be at least three times larger than the evoked set.<ref>Roberts, J., \"A Grounded Model of Consideration Set Size and Composition\", in ''Advances in Consumer Research'', Vol. 16, Thomas K. Srull, (ed.)

Accordingly, the advertising message might attempt to drive consumers to direct sales call centres as part of an integrated communications strategy. <ref>ACCC, ''The Comparator Website Industry in Australia,'' Commonwealth of Australia, 2014, p. 8</ref> Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms or guarantees.\n\n[[File:Shopping list (2098182380).jpg|thumb|''Percy and Rossiter argue that very few shoppers use lists and this has important implications for the purchase decision and advertising strategy'']]\n\nPercy and Rossiter (1992) argue that the two types of awareness, namely ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition'', operate in fundamentally different ways in the purchase decision. For routine purchases such as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), few shoppers carry shopping lists. For them, the presentation of brands at the point-of-sale acts as a visual reminder and triggers category need. In this case, brand recognition is the dominant mode of awareness. For other purchases, where the brand is not present, the consumer first experiences category need then searches memory for brands within that category. Many services, such as home help, gardening services, pizza delivery fall into this category. In this case, the category need precedes brand awareness. Such purchases are recall dominant, and the consumer is more likely to select one of the brands elicited from memory.<ref>Percy, L. and Rossiter, J., \"A Model of Brand Awareness and Brand Attitude Advertising Strategies\", ''Psychology and Marketing'', Vol. 7, no. 4, 1992, pp 263-274</ref> When brand recall is dominant, it is not necessary for consumers to like the advertisement, but they must like the brand. In contrast, consumers should like the ad when brand recognition is the communications objective. <ref>Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, pp 157-160</ref>\n\nThe distinction between ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition'' has important implications for [[advertising]] strategy. When the communications objectives depend on ''brand recognition'', the creative execution must show the brand packaging or a recognisable brand name. However, when the communications objectives rely on ''brand recall'', the creative execution should encourage strong associations between the category and the brand.<ref>Rossiter, J. R., Percy, L. and Donovan, R.J., \u201cA Better Advertising Planning Grid,\u201d ''Journal of Advertising Research'', vol. 31 (October/November), 1991, pp 11-21.</ref> Advertisers also use jingles, mnemonics and other devices to encourage brand recall.\n\n''Brand dominance'' occurs when, during brand recall tests, most consumers can name only one brand from a given category.<ref name=\":1\">Aaker, D. (1996). ''Building Strong Brands.'' New York: Free Press Publications.</ref> Brand dominance is defined as an individual's selection of only certain brand names in a related category during a brand recall procedure.<ref name=\":1\" /> While brand dominance might appear to be a desirable goal, overall dominance can be a double-edged sword.\n\n[[File:\u30af\u30ea\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 (17245624191).jpg|thumb|''When a brand name becomes so well-known that the brand becomes synonymous with the category, the brand is said to have 'gone generic' '']]\nA brand name that is well known to the majority of people or households is also called a ''household name'' <ref>Merriam-Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/household%20name</ref> and may be an indicator of brand success. Occasionally a brand can become so successful that the brand becomes synonymous with the category. For example, British people often talk about \"Hoovering the house\" when they actually mean \"vacuuming the house.\" (Hoover is a brand name). When this happens, the brand name is said to have \"gone ''generic''.\" <ref>Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/generic-brand.html</ref>  Examples of brands becoming generic abound; Kleenex, Cellotape, Nescafe, Aspirin and Panadol. When a brand goes generic, it can present a marketing problem because when the consumer requests a named brand at the retail outlet, they may be supplied with a competing brand. For example, if a person enters a bar and requests \"a rum and Coke,\" the bartender may interpret that to mean a \"rum and cola-flavoured beverage,\"  paving the way for the outlet to supply a cheaper alternative mixer. In such a scenario, Coca-Cola Ltd, who after investing in brand building for more than a century, is the ultimate loser because it does not get the sale.\n\n== Measuring brand awareness ==\n\nJust as different types of brand awareness can be identified, there are a variety of methods for measuring awareness. Typically, researchers use surveys, carried out on a sample of consumers asking about their knowledge of the focus brand or category.\n\nTwo types of recall test are used to measure brand awareness:<ref>Hsia, H.J., ''Mass Communications Research Methods: A Step-by-Step Approach,\" Routledge\"</ref>\n\n*''Unaided recall tests'': where the respondent is presented with a product category and asked to nominate as many brands as possible. Thus, the unaided recall test provides the respondent with no clues or cues. Unaided recall tests are used to test for brand recall.\n*''Aided recall test'': where the respondent is prompted with a brand name and asked whether they have seen it or heard about it. In some aided recall tests, the respondent might also be asked to explain what they know about the brand e.g. to describe package, colour, logo or other distinctive features. Aided recall tests are used to test for brand recognition.\n*''Other brand-effects tests'': In addition, to recall tests, brand research often employs a battery of tests, such as brand association tests, brand attitude, brand image, brand dominance, brand value, brand salience and other measures of brand health. Although these tests do not explicitly measure brand awareness, they provide general measures of brand health and often are used in conjunction with brand recall tests.\n\nTo measure brand salience, for example, researchers place products on a shelf in a supermarket, giving each brand equal shelf space. Consumers are shown photographs of the shelf display and ask consumers to name the brands noticed. The speed at which consumers nominate a given brand is an indicator of brand's ''visual salience.'' This type of research can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of packaging design and brand logos. <ref> Sutherland, M. and Sylvester, A.K., ''Advertising and the Mind of the Consumer: What Works, What Doesn't and Why,'' Great Britain, Kogan Page, 2000 pp 198-199</ref>\n\nMetrics used to measure brand effects are collectively termed AAU metrics ('''A'''wareness, '''A'''ttitudes and '''U'''sage).<ref name=\"Marketing_Metrics\">Farris, Paul W.; Neil T.

Hierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages, beginning with brand awareness (or category awareness) and culminating in the purchase decision. <ref>Egan, J., ''Marketing Communications,'' London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43</ref> In these models, advertising and marketing communications operate as an external stimulus and the purchase decision is a consumer response.\n\nA number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including DAGMAR and AIDA.<ref>Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., \"The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad,\" in ''Branding and Advertising'', Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307</ref> In a survey of more than 250 papers, Vakratsas and Ambler (1999) found little empirical support for any of the hierarchies of effects.<ref>Demetrios Vakratsas and Tim Ambler, \"How Advertising Works: What Do We Really Know?\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 1, 1999, pp. 26-43 DOI: 10.2307/1251999 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251999</ref> In spite of that, some authors have argued that hierarchical models continue to dominate theory, especially in the area of marketing communications and advertising.<ref>O\u2019Shaughnessy, J.,  ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992</ref>\n\nThe ''hierarchy of effects'' developed by Lavidge in the 1960s is one of the original hierarchical models.

While awareness is a necessary precondition for a purchase, awareness alone cannot guarantee the ultimate purchase. Consumers may be aware of a brand, but for different reasons, may not like it or may fail to develop a preference for that brand. Hence, brand awareness is an indicator of sales performance, but does not account for all sales performance.<ref>Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, p. 107-109</ref>  For these reasons, marketers use a variety of metrics, including cognitive, affective and behavioral variables, to monitor a brand's market performance.\n\nAs consumers move through the ''hierarchy of effects'' (awareness\u2192 knowledge\u2192 liking\u2192 preference\u2192 conviction\u2192 purchase), they rely on different sources of information to learn about brands.  While main media advertising is useful for creating awareness, its capacity to convey long or complex messages is limited. In order to acquire more detailed knowledge about a brand, consumers rely on different sources such as product reviews, expert opinion, [[word-of-mouth]] referrals and brand/ corporate websites. As consumers move closer to the actual purchase, they begin to rely on more personal sources of information such as recommendations from friends and relatives or the advice of sales representatives.<ref>Srinivasan,N., \"Pre-purchase External Search Information,\" in Valarie A. Zeithaml (ed), ''Review of Marketing 1990'', Marketing Classics Press (AMA), 2011, pp 153-189</ref> For example, the opinion of an influential blogger might be enough to shore up preference/conviction while a salesperson might be necessary to close the actual purchase.\n\n[[File:The Purchase Funnel.jpg|thumb|The Purchase Funnel indicates that awareness is a necessary precondition for purchase]]\n\nAll hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude or brand liking, which serves to underscore the importance of creating high levels of awareness as early as possible in a [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)|product or brand life-cycle]]. Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the advertising effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a [[Purchase funnel|funnel]].<ref>Court, D.

To achieve top-of-mind awareness, marketers have traditionally, relied on intensive '''advertising''' campaigns, especially at the time of a product launch.<ref>Belch, G, Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., ''Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective'', McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, p.126</ref> To be successful, an intensive campaign utilises both broad ''reach'' (expose more people to the message) and high ''frequency'' (expose people multiple times to the message). Advertising, especially main media advertising, was seen as the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create high awareness levels. Nevertheless, intensive advertising campaigns can become very expensive and can rarely be sustained for long periods.\nAlhaddad (2015) indicates that advertising awareness plays as a good source of meaning and identity for a brand by enhance brand awareness and brand image in social media <ref>Alhaddad, A. A.(2015). The Effect of Advertising Awareness on Brand Equity in Social Media. IJEEEE, 5(2), pp.73-84.</ref>\n\nAs new products enter the market growth stage, the number of competitors tends to increase with implications for market share. Marketers may need to maintain awareness at some predetermined level to ensure steady sales and stable market share. Marketers often rely on rough and ready 'rules-of-thumb' to estimate the amount of advertising expenditure required to achieve a given level of awareness. For instance, it was often held that to increase brand awareness by just one per cent, it was necessary to double the dollars spent on advertising.<ref>See for instance, Jones, J.P, ''The Ultimate Secrets of Advertising'', Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA, 2002</ref>\n\nWhen a brand becomes established and attains the desired awareness levels (typically outlined in the marketing plan), the brand advertiser will shift from an intensive advertising campaign to a ''reminder campaign.''  The objective of a reminder campaign is simply to keep target audiences aware of the brand's existence and to introduce new life into the brand offer.<ref>Business Dictionary (online), http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/reminder-advertising.html</ref> A reminder campaign typically maintains broad reach, but with reduced frequency and as a consequence is a less expensive advertising option. Reminder advertising is used by established brands, often when they are entering the maturity stage of the ''[[product lifecycle]].'' In the decline stage, marketers often shift to a ''caretaker'' or maintenance program where advertising expenditure is cut back.\n\n[[File:A serviceman accesses social media channels using an iPad, outside MOD Main Building in London MOD 45156052.jpg|thumb|''The rise of digital media and social networks is changing the way that consumers search for product information'']]\n\nWhile advertising remains important for creating awareness, a number of changes in the media landscape and to consumer media habits have reduced the reliance on main media advertising. Instead, marketers are seeking to place their brand messages across a much wider variety of platforms. An increasing amount of consumer time and attention is devoted to digital communications devices - from computers and tablets through to cellphones. It is now possible to engage with consumers in a more cost efficient manner using platforms such as social media networks that command massive audiences. For example, Facebook has become an extremely important communications channel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dokyun, L., Hosanagar, K., & Nair, H. S. (2015).

Indeed, the digital environment has created more opportunities for bloggers to become important influencers because they are seen as accessible, authentic and tend to have loyal followings.<ref>Paul McIntyre, \u201cIndependent bloggers overtake celebrities as key social media influencers\u201d, '' Australian Financial Review'' , 22 June 2015 Online:http://www.afr.com/business/independent-bloggers-overtake-celebrities-as-key-social-media-influencers-20150528-ghbovu</ref> Bloggers have become key influencers in important consumer goods and services including fashion, consumer electronics, food and beverage, cooking, restaurant dining and bars. For example, a recent survey by Collective Bias, showed that when it comes to product endorsements digital influencers are more popular than celebrities. Findings showed that only 3% of participants said they would consider buying a celebrity-endorsed item, in comparison to 60% who said they had been influenced by a blog review or social media post when shopping.<ref>Singh, N., \"Celebrity Vs Shopper\" ''Harper's Bazaar'' (Australia), 2 April 2016 Online: http://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/news/fashion-buzz/2016/4/bloggers-are-more-popular-than-celebrities/</ref> For marketers, the digital landscape has made it somewhat easier to identify social influencers.\n\n==Popular examples of brand advertising and promotion==\nThe following examples illustrate how brand awareness and brand advertising are used in practice.\n\n===Coca-Cola \"Share a Coke\" campaign===\n{{main|Share a Coke}}\n[[File:\"Share a Coke\" (14823114294).jpg|thumb|The \"Share a Coke\" campaign received multiple \"Creative Effectiveness\" awards at the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]].]]\n\nCoca-Cola is a well-established brand with a long history and one that has achieved market dominance. For any brand, such as Coke, that controls some 70 percent of market share, there are relatively few opportunities to enlist new customers. Yet Coca-Cola is always on the lookout for novel communications that not only maintain its brand awareness, but that bring the brand to the attention of new audiences. The company launched a campaign which became known as \"Share a Coke\", with the campaign objectives; \"to strengthen the brand\u2019s bond with Australia\u2019s young adults \u2013 and inspire shared moments of happiness in the real and virtual worlds.\"<ref name=\"shareacoke\">{{cite web |url=https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/share-a-coke-how-the-groundbreaking-campaign-got-its-start-down-under |title=Share a Coke: How the Groundbreaking Campaign Got Its Start 'Down Under' |last=Moye |first=Jay |date=2014-09-25 |publisher=The Coca-Cola Company |access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> The campaign, originally launched in Australia, became so successful that it was subsequently rolled out to other countries.\n\nThe concept was to introduce personalized Coke bottles or cans. Popular names were written in a 'look-alike Spencerian script' which is part of the Coke brand's distinctive brand identity. The campaign organisers seeded social media by targeting \"opinion leaders and influencers to get them to [\u2026] lead the conversation and encourage others to seek out 'Share a Coke' for themselves\".<ref name=\"shareacoke\"/> Within days celebrities and others with no connection to Coke were spreading the concept across social networks. The campaign extended the audience reach as more people were exposed to the messages. According to Coke's creative team, \"That [Australian] summer, Coke sold more than 250 million named bottles and cans in a nation of just under 23 million people\". This campaign helped Coke extend its awareness across a broader age profile as they interacted with each customer on a personal level.<ref name=\"shareacoke\"/>\n\n===Ronald McDonald and other anthropomorphic brand characters===\n{{main|Ronald McDonald}}\n[[File:Ronald McDonald, Quetzaltenango.jpg|thumb|Ronald McDonald is an anthropomorphic brand character that has become part of McDonald's brand identity.]]\nConsumers experience few difficulties assigning a personality to a brand and marketing communications often encourage consumers to think about brands as possessing human characteristics.<ref>Puzakova, M., Kwak, H. and Rocereto, J., \"Pushing the Envelope of Brand and Personality: Antecedents and Moderators of Anthropomorphized Brands\", in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 36, Ann L.

For example, the [[Michelin man]], employed as a memorable character to sell Michelin car tyres, was introduced as early as 1894. These characters benefit the brand by creating memorable images in the consumer's mind while conveying meanings that are consistent with the brand's values.\n\nMcDonald's created a similar anthropomorphic brand character known as [[Ronald Mcdonald]] as part of its brand identity. For younger consumers, Ronald McDonald injects a sense of fun and mystery into the McDonald's brand. For parents, the character clearly signals that McDonald's is a family friendly venue. Characters help to carry the brand's identity and can be seen as non-human \"spokes-character\", contributing to a strong brand differentiation. The likeability of the brands character can \"positively influence attitudes towards the brand and increase [consumers'] purchase intention\"<ref>Hosany, S., Prayag, G., Martin, D., & Lee, W., \"Theory and Strategies of Anthropomorphic Brand Characters from Peter Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, and Ronald McDonald, to Hello Kitty.

Brand awareness is a key consideration in [[Consumer Behaviour|consumer behavior]], [[advertising management]], [[brand management]] and strategy development. The consumer's ability to recognise or recall a brand is central to purchasing decision-making. Purchasing cannot proceed unless a consumer is first aware of a product category and a brand within that category. Awareness does not necessarily mean that the consumer must be able to recall a specific brand name, but he or she must be able to recall sufficient distinguishing features for purchasing to proceed. For instance, if a consumer asks her friend to buy her some gum in a \"blue pack\", the friend would be expected to know which gum to buy, even though neither friend can recall the precise brand name at the time.\n\nDifferent types of brand awareness have been identified, namely ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition''. Key researchers argue that these different types of awareness operate in fundamentally different ways and that this has important implications for the purchase decision process and for marketing communications. Brand awareness is closely related to concepts such as the ''evoked set'' and ''consideration set'' which describe specific aspects of the consumer's purchase decision. Consumers are believed to hold between three and seven brands in their consideration set across a broad range of product categories. Consumers will normally purchase one of the top three brands in their  consideration set.\n\nBrand awareness is a key indicator of a brand's competitive market performance. Given the importance of brand awareness in consumer purchasing decisions, marketers have developed a number of metrics designed to measure brand awareness and other measures of brand health. These metrics are collectively known as '''A'''wareness, '''A'''ttitudes and '''U'''sage (AAU) metrics.\n\nTo ensure a product or brand's market success, awareness levels must be managed across the entire product life-cycle - from product launch through to market decline. Many marketers regularly monitor brand awareness levels, and if they fall below a predetermined threshold, the advertising and promotional effort is intensified until awareness returns to the desired level.\n\n== Importance of brand awareness ==\n\nBrand awareness is related to the functions of brand identities in consumers\u2019 memory and can be measured by how well the consumers can identify the brand under various conditions.<ref name=\"Keller 1993\">{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin|title=Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity|journal=The Journal of Marketing|year=1993|volume=1|issue=22}}</ref> Brand awareness is also central to understanding the consumer purchase decision process.

For the assets and liabilities to have effect on brand equity, they have to be related to the name or logo of the brand. If the brand's name or logo changes, then, it can either have a positive or a negative impact on the assets and liabilities of the brand, with some of them getting transferred to the new name and logo. The brand equity stands on the assets and liabilities and it can differ from factor to factor such as, brand loyalty, brand name awareness, how a customer perceives the quality of a brand, and other proprietary assets such as patent and trademark.<ref>{{cite book |last1=A.

E., & Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012</ref> These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.\n\n=== Brand recall===\n\nBrand recall is also known as ''unaided recall'' or ''spontaneous recall'' and refers to the ability of the consumers to correctly elicit a brand name from memory when prompted by a product category.<ref name=\"Keller 1993\"/> Brand recall indicates a relatively strong link between a category and a brand while brand recognition indicates a weaker link. When prompted by a product category, most consumers can only recall a relatively small set of brands, typically around 3\u20135 brand names. In consumer tests, few consumers can recall more than seven brand names within a given category and for low-interest product categories, most consumers can only recall one or two brand names.<ref>Trout, J. and Ries, A., \"The Positioning Era Cometh\", ''Advertising Age'' [Special Feature on Positioning], 24 April 1972</ref>\n\nResearch suggests that the number of brands that consumers can recall is affected by both individual and product factors including; brand loyalty, awareness set size, situational, usage factors and education level.<ref>Reilly, M. and Parkinson, T.L., \"Individual and Product Correlates of Evoked Set Size For Consumer Package Goods\", in '' Advances in Consumer Research,''  Vol. 12, Elizabeth C.

This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify the brand name. Instead, it means that consumers can recognise the brand when presented with it at the point-of-sale or after viewing its visual packaging.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology & Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263\u2013274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}</ref> In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognise it.\n\n==== Top-of-mind awareness====\n\nConsumers will normally purchase one of the top three brands in their consideration set. This is known as  \n[[top-of-mind awareness]].<ref>Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,''pp 17-19</ref> Consequently, one of the goals for most marketing communications is to increase the probability that consumers will include the brand in their consideration sets.\n\nBy definition, top-of-mind awareness is \"the first brand that comes to mind when a customer is asked an unprompted question about a category.\"<ref>Farris, Paul W.; Neil T.

A., & Sheth, J.N. (1969). ''The Theory of Buyer Behaviour''.

When making purchase decisions, consumers acquire information from a wide variety of sources in order to inform their decisions. After searching for information about a category, consumers may become aware of a larger number of brands which collectively are known as the ''awareness set''.<ref>Chon, K.Y., Pizam, A. and Mansfeld, Y., ''Consumer Behavior in Travel and Tourism'', 2nd ed, 2000, New York, Haworth, pp 86-87</ref> Thus, the awareness set is likely to change as consumers acquire new information about brands or products.  A review of empirical studies in this area suggests that the consideration set is likely to be at least three times larger than the evoked set.<ref>Roberts, J., \"A Grounded Model of Consideration Set Size and Composition\", in ''Advances in Consumer Research'', Vol. 16, Thomas K.

Accordingly, the advertising message might attempt to drive consumers to direct sales call centres as part of an integrated communications strategy. <ref>ACCC, ''The Comparator Website Industry in Australia,'' Commonwealth of Australia, 2014, p. 8</ref> Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms or guarantees.\n\n[[File:Shopping list (2098182380).jpg|thumb|''Percy and Rossiter argue that very few shoppers use lists and this has important implications for the purchase decision and advertising strategy'']]\n\nPercy and Rossiter (1992) argue that the two types of awareness, namely ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition'', operate in fundamentally different ways in the purchase decision. For routine purchases such as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), few shoppers carry shopping lists. For them, the presentation of brands at the point-of-sale acts as a visual reminder and triggers category need. In this case, brand recognition is the dominant mode of awareness. For other purchases, where the brand is not present, the consumer first experiences category need then searches memory for brands within that category. Many services, such as home help, gardening services, pizza delivery fall into this category. In this case, the category need precedes brand awareness. Such purchases are recall dominant, and the consumer is more likely to select one of the brands elicited from memory.<ref>Percy, L. and Rossiter, J., \"A Model of Brand Awareness and Brand Attitude Advertising Strategies\", ''Psychology and Marketing'', Vol. 7, no. 4, 1992, pp 263-274</ref> When brand recall is dominant, it is not necessary for consumers to like the advertisement, but they must like the brand. In contrast, consumers should like the ad when brand recognition is the communications objective. <ref>Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, pp 157-160</ref>\n\nThe distinction between ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition'' has important implications for [[advertising]] strategy. When the communications objectives depend on ''brand recognition'', the creative execution must show the brand packaging or a recognisable brand name. However, when the communications objectives rely on ''brand recall'', the creative execution should encourage strong associations between the category and the brand.<ref>Rossiter, J.

New York: Free Press Publications.</ref> Brand dominance is defined as an individual\u2019s selection of only certain brand names in a related category during a brand recall procedure.<ref name=\":1\" /> While brand dominance might appear to be a desirable goal, overall dominance can be a double-edged sword.\n\n[[File:\u30af\u30ea\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 (17245624191).jpg|thumb|''When a brand name becomes so well-known that the brand becomes synonymous with the category, the brand is said to have 'gone generic' '']]\nA brand name that is well known to the majority of people or households is also called a ''household name'' <ref>Merriam-Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/household%20name</ref> and may be an indicator of brand success. Occasionally a brand can become so successful that the brand becomes synonymous with the category. For example, British people often talk about \"Hoovering the house\" when they actually mean \"vacuuming the house.\" (Hoover is a brand name). When this happens, the brand name is said to have \"gone ''generic''.\" <ref>Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/generic-brand.html</ref>  Examples of brands becoming generic abound; Kleenex, Cellotape, Nescafe, Aspirin and Panadol. When a brand goes generic, it can present a marketing problem because when the consumer requests a named brand at the retail outlet, they may be supplied with a competing brand. For example, if a person enters a bar and requests \"a rum and Coke,\" the bartender may interpret that to mean a \"rum and cola-flavoured beverage,\"  paving the way for the outlet to supply a cheaper alternative mixer. In such a scenario, Coca-Cola Ltd, who after investing in brand building for more than a century, is the ultimate loser because it does not get the sale.\n\n== Measuring brand awareness ==\n\nJust as different types of brand awareness can be identified, there are a variety of methods for measuring awareness. Typically, researchers use surveys, carried out on a sample of consumers asking about their knowledge of the focus brand or category.\n\nTwo types of recall test are used to measure brand awareness:<ref>Hsia, H.J., ''Mass Communications Research Methods: A Step-by-Step Approach,\" Routledge\"</ref>\n\n*''Unaided recall tests'': where the respondent is presented with a product category and asked to nominate as many brands as possible. Thus, the unaided recall test provides the respondent with no clues or cues. Unaided recall tests are used to test for brand recall.\n*''Aided recall test'': where the respondent is prompted with a brand name and asked whether they have seen it or heard about it. In some aided recall tests, the respondent might also be asked to explain what they know about the brand e.g. to describe package, colour, logo or other distinctive features. Aided recall tests are used to test for brand recognition.\n*''Other brand-effects tests'': In addition, to recall tests, brand research often employs a battery of tests, such as brand association tests, brand attitude, brand image, brand dominance, brand value, brand salience and other measures of brand health. Although these tests do not explicitly measure brand awareness, they provide general measures of brand health and often are used in conjunction with brand recall tests.\n\nTo measure brand salience, for example, researchers place products on a shelf in a supermarket, giving each brand equal shelf space. Consumers are shown photographs of the shelf display and ask consumers to name the brands noticed. The speed at which consumers nominate a given brand is an indicator of brand's ''visual salience.'' This type of research can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of packaging design and brand logos. <ref> Sutherland, M. and Sylvester, A.K., ''Advertising and the Mind of the Consumer: What Works, What Doesn't and Why,'' Great Britain, Kogan Page, 2000 pp 198-199</ref>\n\nMetrics used to measure brand effects are collectively termed AAU metrics ('''A'''wareness, '''A'''ttitudes and '''U'''sage).<ref name=\"Marketing_Metrics\">Farris, Paul W.; Neil T.

Hierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages, beginning with brand awareness (or category awareness) and culminating in the purchase decision. <ref>Egan, J., ''Marketing Communications,'' London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43</ref> In these models, advertising and marketing communications operate as an external stimulus and the purchase decision is a consumer response.\n\nA number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including DAGMAR and AIDA.<ref>Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., \"The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad,\" in ''Branding and Advertising'', Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307</ref> In a survey of more than 250 papers, Vakratsas and Ambler (1999) found little empirical support for any of the hierarchies of effects.<ref>Demetrios Vakratsas and Tim Ambler, \"How Advertising Works: What Do We Really Know?\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 1, 1999, pp. 26-43 DOI: 10.2307/1251999 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251999</ref> In spite of that, some authors have argued that hierarchical models continue to dominate theory, especially in the area of marketing communications and advertising.<ref>O\u2019Shaughnessy, J.,  ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992</ref>\n\nThe ''hierarchy of effects'' developed by Lavidge in the 1960s is one of the original hierarchical models.

While awareness is a necessary precondition for a purchase, awareness alone cannot guarantee the ultimate purchase. Consumers may be aware of a brand, but for different reasons, may not like it or may fail to develop a preference for that brand. Hence, brand awareness is an indicator of sales performance, but does not account for all sales performance.<ref>Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, p. 107-109</ref>  For these reasons, marketers use a variety of metrics, including cognitive, affective and behavioral variables, to monitor a brand's market performance.\n\nAs consumers move through the ''hierarchy of effects'' (awareness\u2192 knowledge\u2192 liking\u2192 preference\u2192 conviction\u2192 purchase), they rely on different sources of information to learn about brands.  While main media advertising is useful for creating awareness, its capacity to convey long or complex messages is limited. In order to acquire more detailed knowledge about a brand, consumers rely on different sources such as product reviews, expert opinion, [[word-of-mouth]] referrals and brand/ corporate websites. As consumers move closer to the actual purchase, they begin to rely on more personal sources of information such as recommendations from friends and relatives or the advice of sales representatives.<ref>Srinivasan,N., \"Pre-purchase External Search Information,\" in Valarie A. Zeithaml (ed), ''Review of Marketing 1990'', Marketing Classics Press (AMA), 2011, pp 153-189</ref> For example, the opinion of an influential blogger might be enough to shore up preference/conviction while a salesperson might be necessary to close the actual purchase.\n\n[[File:The Purchase Funnel.jpg|thumb|The Purchase Funnel indicates that awareness is a necessary precondition for purchase]]\n\nAll hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude or brand liking, which serves to underscore the importance of creating high levels of awareness as early as possible in a [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)|product or brand life-cycle]]. Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the advertising effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a [[Purchase funnel|funnel]].<ref>Court, D.  Elzinga, D., Mulder, S. and Vetvik, O.J., \"The Consumer Decision Journey\", ''McKinsey Quarterly'', June 2009, Online: http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-consumer-decision-journey</ref> Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotions such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand.\n\n== Creating and maintaining brand awareness ==\n\n{{See also|Product life-cycle management (marketing)|Brand management|Advertising management}}\n\nBrand advertising can increase the probability that a consumer will include a given brand in his or her consideration set. Brand-related advertising expenditure has a positive effect on brand awareness levels. Virtually anything that exposes consumers to a brand increases brand awareness. \u201cRepeat brand exposure in stores improves consumers' ability to recognize and recall the brand.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Huang, R., & Sarig\u00f6ll\u00fc, E.

To achieve top-of-mind awareness, marketers have traditionally, relied on intensive '''advertising''' campaigns, especially at the time of a product launch.<ref>Belch, G, Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., ''Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective'', McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, p.126</ref> To be successful, an intensive campaign utilises both broad ''reach'' (expose more people to the message) and high ''frequency'' (expose people multiple times to the message). Advertising, especially main media advertising, was seen as the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create high awareness levels. Nevertheless, intensive advertising campaigns can become very expensive and can rarely be sustained for long periods.\nAlhaddad (2015) indicates that advertising awareness plays as a good source of meaning and identity for a brand by enhance brand awareness and brand image in social media <ref>Alhaddad, A. A.(2015). The Effect of Advertising Awareness on Brand Equity in Social Media. IJEEEE, 5(2), pp.73-84.</ref>\n\nAs new products enter the market growth stage, the number of competitors tends to increase with implications for market share. Marketers may need to maintain awareness at some predetermined level to ensure steady sales and stable market share. Marketers often rely on rough and ready 'rules-of-thumb' to estimate the amount of advertising expenditure required to achieve a given level of awareness. For instance, it was often held that to increase brand awareness by just one per cent, it was necessary to double the dollars spent on advertising.<ref>See for instance, Jones, J.P, ''The Ultimate Secrets of Advertising'', Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA, 2002</ref>\n\nWhen a brand becomes established and attains the desired awareness levels (typically outlined in the marketing plan), the brand advertiser will shift from an intensive advertising campaign to a ''reminder campaign.''  The objective of a reminder campaign is simply to keep target audiences aware of the brand's existence and to introduce new life into the brand offer.<ref>Business Dictionary (online), http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/reminder-advertising.html</ref> A reminder campaign typically maintains broad reach, but with reduced frequency and as a consequence is a less expensive advertising option. Reminder advertising is used by established brands, often when they are entering the maturity stage of the ''[[product lifecycle]].'' In the decline stage, marketers often shift to a ''caretaker'' or maintenance program where advertising expenditure is cut back.\n\n[[File:A serviceman accesses social media channels using an iPad, outside MOD Main Building in London MOD 45156052.jpg|thumb|''The rise of digital media and social networks is changing the way that consumers search for product information'']]\n\nWhile advertising remains important for creating awareness, a number of changes in the media landscape and to consumer media habits have reduced the reliance on main media advertising. Instead, marketers are seeking to place their brand messages across a much wider variety of platforms. An increasing amount of consumer time and attention is devoted to digital communications devices - from computers and tablets through to cellphones. It is now possible to engage with consumers in a more cost efficient manner using platforms such as social media networks that command massive audiences. For example, Facebook has become an extremely important communications channel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dokyun, L., Hosanagar, K., & Nair, H. S. (2015).

Interactive communications provide more opportunities for brands to connect with audience members and to move beyond simple awareness, facilitating brand preference, brand conviction and ultimately brand loyalty.\n\nThe rise of social media networks has increased the opportunities for ''opinion leaders'' to play a role in brand awareness.<ref name=\":6\">Malaska, M., Saraniemi, S., & Tahtinen, J.

Indeed, the digital environment has created more opportunities for bloggers to become important influencers because they are seen as accessible, authentic and tend to have loyal followings.<ref>Paul McIntyre, \u201cIndependent bloggers overtake celebrities as key social media influencers\u201d, '' Australian Financial Review'' , 22 June 2015 Online:http://www.afr.com/business/independent-bloggers-overtake-celebrities-as-key-social-media-influencers-20150528-ghbovu</ref> Bloggers have become key influencers in important consumer goods and services including fashion, consumer electronics, food and beverage, cooking, restaurant dining and bars. For example, a recent survey by Collective Bias, showed that when it comes to product endorsements digital influencers are more popular than celebrities. Findings showed that only 3% of participants said they would consider buying a celebrity-endorsed item, in comparison to 60% who said they had been influenced by a blog review or social media post when shopping.<ref>Singh, N., \"Celebrity Vs Shopper\" ''Harper's Bazaar'' (Australia), 2 April 2016 Online: http://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/news/fashion-buzz/2016/4/bloggers-are-more-popular-than-celebrities/</ref> For marketers, the digital landscape has made it somewhat easier to identify social influencers.\n\n==Popular examples of brand advertising and promotion==\nThe following examples illustrate how brand awareness and brand advertising are used in practice.\n\n===Coca-Cola \"Share a Coke\" campaign===\n{{main|Share a Coke}}\n[[File:\"Share a Coke\" (14823114294).jpg|thumb|The \"Share a Coke\" campaign received multiple \"Creative Effectiveness\" awards at the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]].]]\n\nCoca-Cola is a well-established brand with a long history and one that has achieved market dominance. For any brand, such as Coke, that controls some 70 percent of market share, there are relatively few opportunities to enlist new customers. Yet Coca-Cola is always on the lookout for novel communications that not only maintain its brand awareness, but that bring the brand to the attention of new audiences. The company launched a campaign which became known as \"Share a Coke\", with the campaign objectives; \"to strengthen the brand\u2019s bond with Australia\u2019s young adults \u2013 and inspire shared moments of happiness in the real and virtual worlds.\"<ref name=\"shareacoke\">{{cite web |url=https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/share-a-coke-how-the-groundbreaking-campaign-got-its-start-down-under |title=Share a Coke: How the Groundbreaking Campaign Got Its Start 'Down Under' |last=Moye |first=Jay |date=2014-09-25 |publisher=The Coca-Cola Company |access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> The campaign, originally launched in Australia, became so successful that it was subsequently rolled out to other countries.\n\nThe concept was to introduce personalized Coke bottles or cans. Popular names were written in a 'look-alike Spencerian script' which is part of the Coke brand's distinctive brand identity. The campaign organisers seeded social media by targeting \"opinion leaders and influencers to get them to [\u2026] lead the conversation and encourage others to seek out 'Share a Coke' for themselves\".<ref name=\"shareacoke\"/> Within days celebrities and others with no connection to Coke were spreading the concept across social networks. The campaign extended the audience reach as more people were exposed to the messages. According to Coke's creative team, \"That [Australian] summer, Coke sold more than 250 million named bottles and cans in a nation of just under 23 million people\". This campaign helped Coke extend its awareness across a broader age profile as they interacted with each customer on a personal level.<ref name=\"shareacoke\"/>\n\n===Ronald McDonald and other anthropomorphic brand characters===\n{{main|Ronald McDonald}}\n[[File:Ronald McDonald, Quetzaltenango.jpg|thumb|Ronald McDonald is an anthropomorphic brand character that has become part of McDonald's brand identity.]]\nConsumers experience few difficulties assigning a personality to a brand and marketing communications often encourage consumers to think about brands as possessing human characteristics.<ref>Puzakova, M., Kwak, H. and Rocereto, J., \"Pushing the Envelope of Brand and Personality: Antecedents and Moderators of Anthropomorphized Brands\", in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 36, Ann L.

For example, the [[Michelin man]], employed as a memorable character to sell Michelin car tyres, was introduced as early as 1894. These characters benefit the brand by creating memorable images in the consumer\u2019s mind while conveying meanings that are consistent with the brand's values.\n\nMcDonald's created a similar anthropomorphic brand character known as [[Ronald Mcdonald]] as part of its brand identity. For younger consumers, Ronald McDonald injects a sense of fun and mystery into the McDonald's brand. For parents, the character clearly signals that McDonald's is a family friendly venue. Characters help to carry the brand's identity and can be seen as non-human \"spokes-character\", contributing to a strong brand differentiation. The likeability of the brands character can \"positively influence attitudes towards the brand and increase [consumers'] purchase intention\"<ref>Hosany, S., Prayag, G., Martin, D., & Lee, W., \"Theory and Strategies of Anthropomorphic Brand Characters from Peter Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, and Ronald McDonald, to Hello Kitty.

Radama encouraged these [[London Missionary Society]] envoys to establish schools to teach tradecraft and literacy to nobles and potential military and civil service recruits; they also introduced [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]] and taught literacy using the translated Bible. A wide range of political and social reforms were enacted under his rule, including an end to the international slave trade, which had historically been a key source of wealth and armaments for the [[Merina people|Merina]] monarchy.

Their initial attempt to capture King Andriamanalina at the fortified city of [[Fandanana]] west of [[Antsirabe]] was unsuccessful. When they returned a year later, Andrianampoinimerina split his army into two columns and put Radama at the head of the second column, providing him with his first opportunity to command a military regiment. He was accompanied by a group of seasoned soldiers called the Tantsaha, and Andriandtsoanandria, one of his father's more experienced military advisers, and successfully negotiated the submission of several towns in Betsileo.

This was followed by a commercial treaty. On 23 October 1817, Radama signed a treaty negotiated by former military general James Hastie that granted Radama a formal alliance with the British crown and its recognition of Radama as \"King of Madagascar\" in exchange for horses, uniforms and a pledge to abandon the [[slave trade|export of slaves]].{{sfn|Fage|Flint|Oliver|1986|p=402}} The British were invited to establish a diplomatic mission on the island, and in 1820 Hastie was appointed to the role of British resident.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi|1998|p=165}} The import of slaves from the African mainland continued, however, and remained Madagascar's primary import throughout Radama's reign and into the 1850s.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi|1998|p=174}}\n\n[[File:French language textbook of Ramada I before 1828.jpg|thumb|left|175px|alt=a page covered in French script|French language workbook of Radama I]]\n\nRadama's military campaign to Toamasina in 1820 brought him into contact with Welshmen [[David Jones (missionary)|David Jones]] and [[David Griffiths (missionary)|David Griffiths]] of the Protestant [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS), who had established a school there enrolling three students.
